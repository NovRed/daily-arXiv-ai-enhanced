### [1] [EfficientQuant: An Efficient Post-Training Quantization for CNN-Transformer Hybrid Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11093)
*Shaibal Saha,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientQuant is a structure-aware PTQ method for hybrid CV models, using uniform quantization for convolutional blocks and log2 quantization for transformer blocks, reducing latency significantly with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid CV models are resource-intensive for edge deployment, and existing PTQ methods are limited for such models.

Method: Proposes EfficientQuant, applying uniform quantization to convolutional blocks and log2 quantization to transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves 2.5×-8.7× latency reduction on ImageNet-1K with minimal accuracy loss and demonstrates efficiency on edge devices.

Conclusion: EfficientQuant is practical for real-world deployment due to its low latency and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

### [2] [Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122)
*Divya Swetha K,Ziaul Haque Choudhury,Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan,Biswajit Brahma,Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining ESRGAN and Faster R-CNN improves object detection in low-resolution images by enhancing image quality first, then detecting objects accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution images hinder object detection; integrating super-resolution and detection methods can overcome this limitation.

Method: Use ESRGAN to enhance low-resolution images, then apply Faster R-CNN for object detection on the improved images.

Result: The integrated approach outperforms traditional methods, offering better detection in poor-quality images.

Conclusion: The framework balances image enhancement and detection, providing a robust solution for variable-quality images.

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

### [3] [Technical Report for Argoverse2 Scenario Mining Challenges on Iterative Error Correction and Spatially-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11124)
*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the RefAV framework for scenario mining in autonomous driving, addressing LLM-generated code errors and spatial-relationship inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scenario mining is vital for self-driving systems, but current methods like RefAV face challenges with LLM-generated code errors and spatial-relationship misinterpretations.

Method: The paper proposes (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism and (2) specialized prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.

Result: Experiments on Argoverse 2 show consistent gains, achieving a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance reliability and precision in scenario mining for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [4] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on classifying iron ore pellets using the StarDist algorithm for improved quality control and measurement accuracy in dense, unstable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately identify and analyze objects in densely packed and unstable environments, especially for quality control in iron ore pellet production.

Method: Utilizes the StarDist algorithm for segmenting objects, determining contours, classifying pellets, and measuring dimensions, overcoming limitations of traditional methods like ViT and Mask R-CNN.

Result: Developed a novel method for detecting objects with smoothed boundaries, enhancing measurement accuracy and size distribution analysis.

Conclusion: The StarDist-based approach provides a robust solution for pellet classification and measurement, addressing challenges in complex environments.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

### [5] [Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131)
*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT introduces an efficient image segmentation model using foveated input images and variable-resolution patch tokenization to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in image segmentation without reducing model size by focusing on the region of interest via foveation.

Method: Extracts a crop centered on a point prompt and applies variable-resolution patch tokenization, downsampling patches farther from the prompt.

Result: STT is more efficient than prior work, competitive on benchmarks, and runs at interactive frame rates on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: STT is a promising tool for augmented reality or robotics due to its efficiency and performance.

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

### [6] [Gender Fairness of Machine Learning Algorithms for Pain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11132)
*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines gender fairness in ML/DL models for pain detection using facial expressions, finding biases despite high accuracy, especially with ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address under-researched fairness in automated pain detection across demographic groups, focusing on gender.

Method: Evaluated ML (L SVM, RBF SVM) and DL (CNN, ViT) models on the UNBC-McMaster database using performance and fairness metrics.

Result: ViT had the highest accuracy but all models showed gender biases, revealing an accuracy-fairness trade-off.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware techniques are needed to reduce biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

### [7] [Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133)
*Christos Pantazopoulos,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for 3D hand articulation estimation from 2D keypoints, eliminating the need for camera parameters, shows competitive performance and robustness in real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of 3D hand articulation from a single color image is challenging due to missing depth, occlusions, and camera parameter dependencies, with applications in AR, VR, HCI, and robotics.

Method: Proposes an optimization pipeline with keypoint alignment and fingertip loss to bypass camera parameter requirements.

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks (EgoDexter, Dexter+Object) and robustness in 'in-the-wild' images without prior camera knowledge.

Conclusion: The approach is effective but sensitive to 2D keypoint accuracy, even with hand priors. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

### [8] [ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134)
*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextLoss (CLoss), a novel loss function for image segmentation that improves topological correctness by considering errors in context, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological errors in segmented structures (e.g., roads, vessels) can impact applications like navigation, necessitating better solutions.

Method: Introduces CLoss, which leverages context in critical pixel masks to focus on topological errors, and two metrics to measure connectivity improvements.

Result: CLoss repairs up to 44% more missed connections and enhances performance on topology-aware metrics across 2D, 3D, and a custom nano-imaging dataset.

Conclusion: CLoss effectively improves topological correctness in segmentation tasks, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

### [9] [JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11136)
*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR is a lightweight, attention-based feature upsampler that enhances spatial resolution for Foundation Vision Encoders without high-resolution supervision, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution outputs from Foundation Vision Encoders require upsampling for high-resolution downstream tasks, but current methods lack flexibility and performance.

Method: JAFAR uses an attention-based module with Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation to align high-resolution queries with low-resolution keys.

Result: JAFAR recovers fine-grained details and outperforms existing upsampling methods across diverse tasks, generalizing well to higher scales.

Conclusion: JAFAR provides an effective, flexible solution for feature upsampling, improving performance without high-resolution supervision.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

### [10] [Autonomous Computer Vision Development with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11140)
*Jin Kim,Muhammad Wahi-Anwa,Sangyun Park,Shawn Shin,John M. Hoffman,Matthew S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agentic AI systems using LLMs can autonomously build a specialized computer vision system from a natural language prompt, achieving high accuracy in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI in automating complex tasks like computer vision system development, traditionally requiring human expertise.

Method: Extended SimpleMind with an LLM-based agent to interpret prompts, plan workflows, and configure tools for medical image analysis, tested on chest x-ray segmentation.

Result: The system autonomously configured, trained, and tested on 50 images, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96 (lungs), 0.82 (heart), and 0.83 (ribs).

Conclusion: Agentic AI can autonomously perform planning and tool configuration, reducing reliance on data scientists in computer vision development.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

### [11] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation improves performance by leveraging uncertainty, dynamic weighting, class rebalancing, and contrastive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, such as ineffective pseudo-label use, class imbalance, and ignored uncertainty.

Method: Introduces fuzzy pseudo-labeling, uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, adaptive class rebalancing, and lightweight contrastive regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively transforms uncertainty into a learning asset, enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Result: Produced a proof-of-concept dashboard, a dataset, and novel measures. Initial evaluation showed clarity, usability, and reduced manual workload.

Conclusion: The system provides objective insights for teacher reflection, improving instructional strategies, and contributes a culturally grounded method to AI-based educational analytics.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual
workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version
does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

### [13] [AlignHuman: Improving Motion and Fidelity via Timestep-Segment Preference Optimization for Audio-Driven Human Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11144)
*Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Wang Liao,Jiaqi Yang,Zerong zheng,Weihong Zeng,Han Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman improves human animation by optimizing motion naturalness and visual fidelity using timestep-segment preference optimization and specialized LoRAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity in human animation tasks.

Method: Proposes AlignHuman, combining Preference Optimization and a divide-and-conquer strategy with timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and specialized LoRAs.

Result: Achieves a 3.3× speedup (100 to 30 NFEs) with minimal quality loss, improving baselines.

Conclusion: AlignHuman effectively balances motion and fidelity, enhancing human animation efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Motivation: To address the lack of diversity and 3D focus in existing Med-VQA datasets, enabling comprehensive benchmarking and advancing 3D diagnostic reasoning.

Method: Creation of the 3D-RAD dataset with six diverse VQA tasks, including anomaly detection and temporal analysis, and evaluation of VLMs on it.

Result: Existing VLMs, especially medical ones, struggle with generalization, particularly in multi-temporal tasks, but fine-tuning on 3D-RAD-T enhances performance.

Conclusion: 3D-RAD and its training set 3D-RAD-T provide a foundation for advancing 3D Med-VQA, with publicly available resources to support future research.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.

creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

### [16] [Self-Calibrating BCIs: Ranking and Recovery of Mental Targets Without Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11151)
*Jonathan Grizou,Carlos de la Torre-Ortiz,Tuukka Ruotsalo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURSOR is a novel framework for recovering mental targets (e.g., faces) from EEG and image data without labeled information, achieving human-like perceptual judgments and generating indistinguishable stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of recovering mental targets from EEG and image data lacks solutions for unlabeled scenarios, motivating the development of a self-calibrating approach.

Method: CURSOR is introduced as an algorithm that learns to recover unknown mental targets without labeled data or pre-trained decoders, using similarity scores and ranking stimuli.

Result: CURSOR predicts image similarity scores correlating with human judgments, ranks stimuli against unknown targets, and generates indistinguishable stimuli (validated via N=53 user study).

Conclusion: CURSOR demonstrates the feasibility of recovering mental targets without labeled data, opening new avenues for EEG-based applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption, an automatic framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), creates diverse video captions for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It addresses issues in existing benchmarks and improves evaluation scope and detail representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks and evaluation protocols have flaws like inadequate key points, high data creation costs, and limited evaluation scopes.

Method: Proposes AutoCaption, leveraging MCTS to iteratively generate diverse and detailed video captions, forming the MCTS-VCB benchmark.

Result: MCTS-VCB effectively evaluates MLLMs, with Gemini-1.5-Pro scoring highest (71.2 F1). Fine-tuning with AutoCaption data improves models like InternVL2.5-8B by 25.0% on MCTS-VCB.

Conclusion: AutoCaption enhances video captioning evaluation and model performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and utility for MLLM assessment.

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate text extraction from mixed scanned and digital documents is challenging; existing methods lack contextual understanding and flexibility.

Method: OCR processes scanned images, layout-aware libraries handle digital files, and LLMs analyze raw text for key-value pairs and ambiguity resolution.

Result: The framework shows significant improvements in accuracy, layout recognition, and semantic precision over rule-based methods.

Conclusion: The combined OCR-LLM approach offers enhanced flexibility and precision for diverse document types.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files
are interpreted through layout-aware libraries. The extracted raw text is
subsequently analyzed by an LLM to identify key-value pairs and resolve
ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced
flexibility and semantic precision across different document categories

TL;DR: The paper explores VLMs' ability in social reasoning, identifies a gap in visual social-pragmatic inference, and benchmarks VLMs on a new task with a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social behavior, especially non-verbal cues, is challenging. VLMs could bridge this gap but their social reasoning capabilities are understudied.

Method: Proposes a new task (Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference), constructs a dataset, and benchmarks several VLMs.

Result: Identifies a limitation in VLMs (Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap) and evaluates their performance on the new task.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved VLMs in social reasoning and provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

*Simon Ghyselincks,Valeriia Okhmak,Stefano Zampini,George Turkiyyah,David Keyes,Eldad Haber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method uses synthetic data to visualize the Earth's subsurface, improving with borehole data, for applications like resource exploration and hazard assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of visualizing the subsurface for applications like resource exploration and hazard assessment, limited by scarce subsurface data.

Method: Training a neural network on synthetic data mimicking geological processes to generate 3D subsurface images from surface data and boreholes.

Result: The model generates accurate 3D subsurface structures (layers, faults, etc.), with fidelity improving with borehole data.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for subsurface visualization and can be fine-tuned for specific regions or used as an AI-based regularizer in inverse problems.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models for HAR using WiFi CSI datasets, considering real-world applications.

Method: Comparison of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models on UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR datasets, analyzing spatial and temporal feature extraction.

Result: CNN+GRU achieves 95.20% accuracy on UT-HAR; BiLSTM scores 92.05% on NTU-Fi HAR. Dataset traits and preprocessing impact performance.

Conclusion: Model performance depends on dataset characteristics. Both models show promise for real-world HAR applications like healthcare and smart homes.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity
recognition.

*Ji Young Byun,Young-Jin Park,Navid Azizan,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework enhances LLMs' reasoning for medical image diagnosis using test-time scaling, improving accuracy across imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored application of LLMs in visual question answering for medical imaging and the impracticality of supervised fine-tuning due to data limitations.

Method: A vision-language model processes medical images and textual prompts to generate interpretations, which are consolidated by an LLM using test-time scaling for reliable diagnosis.

Result: The framework improves diagnostic accuracy across radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology, with unbiased prompting enhancing reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot framework effectively enhances LLMs' diagnostic reasoning in clinical settings.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Motivation: Current fMRI analysis methods suffer from reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing and task-specific models.

Method: NeuroSTORM uses a Mamba backbone and shifted scanning strategy to process 4D fMRI volumes, with spatial-temporal optimized pre-training and task-specific prompt tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification.

Conclusion: NeuroSTORM offers a standardized, open-source foundation model to enhance fMRI-based clinical research.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based model, improves sEMG gesture recognition by integrating time and frequency features, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying similar gestures with nearly identical sEMG signals is challenging, and traditional deep learning models are too large for embedded systems.

Method: Proposes WaveFormer, a transformer-based architecture with a novel learnable wavelet transform and WaveletConv module for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 95% accuracy on EPN612 dataset with 3.1M parameters and 6.75 ms inference latency under INT8 quantization.

Conclusion: WaveFormer offers a compact, efficient solution for real-time sEMG gesture recognition on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

*Hongyu Chen,Jiping Liu,Yong Wang,Jun Zhu,Dejun Feng,Yakun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SF-TMAT, a novel benchmark for UAV object detection in adverse conditions, addressing domain gaps and noisy pseudo-labels with dynamic feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods fail in UAV imagery under adverse conditions due to unique perspectives and noise, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: SF-TMAT uses DSFMA for dynamic mask adjustment and VFST for adaptive pseudo-label thresholding, leveraging statistical feedback.

Result: SF-TMAT outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior generalization in adverse UAV scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates domain bias and improves UAV object detection in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

*Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Jing Ren,Ciyuan Peng,Chengyao Xie,Bowen Li,Feng Xia*

TL;DR: BrainMAP is a multimodal graph learning framework for efficiently identifying neurodegenerative disease-affected brain regions, reducing computational overhead by focusing on relevant subgraphs and using advanced fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods lack precision in localizing affected brain regions and suffer from high computational complexity, limiting practical use.

Method: BrainMAP uses atlas-driven filtering to extract critical subgraphs and employs cross-node attention with adaptive gating for multimodal fusion of fMRI and DTI data.

Result: BrainMAP reduces computational overhead by over 50% while maintaining predictive accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BrainMAP offers a precise and computationally efficient solution for neurodegenerative disease detection, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

*Amirali Ataee Naeini,Ashkan Teymouri,Ghazaleh Jafarsalehi,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model improves vehicle speed detection accuracy, lane identification, and vehicle classification for traffic monitoring in California.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in vehicle numbers and inadequate transportation systems in California require better speed detection methods, especially for HOV lanes and heavy vehicle restrictions.

Method: The study uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model trained on 800 bird's-eye view images, focusing on lane identification and vehicle classification (cars vs. heavy vehicles). It also evaluates factors like drone height and ROI distance.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.97 mph and mean squared error of 0.94 mph², outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification, proving practical for traffic monitoring.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-tracing unlearning is inadequate for diverse requests from stakeholders without access to massive training data, and knowledge-tracing aligns better with human cognitive processes.

Method: Proposes knowledge-tracing unlearning for foundation models, supported by practical needs and cognitive studies, with a case study on a vision-language model.

Result: Knowledge-tracing unlearning is more feasible and aligned with human cognition than data-tracing for foundation models.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for knowledge-tracing unlearning as a practical and cognitively aligned approach for foundation models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Motivation: Real-world environments dynamically change across space and time, posing challenges for world modeling. The goal is to create agents capable of understanding and manipulating these dynamics.

Method: The authors develop STRIDE, a dataset with interconnected observation, state, and action nodes, and TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model integrating spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: TARDIS achieves robust performance in tasks like photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist agents with enhanced embodied reasoning, leveraging spatio-temporal dynamics. Resources are publicly available.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

### [31] [HyBiomass: Global Hyperspectral Imagery Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Geospatial Foundation Models in Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11314)
*Aaron Banze,Timothée Stassin,Nassim Ait Ali Braham,Rıdvan Salih Kuzu,Simon Besnard,Michael Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation to benchmark geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs), addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for Geo-FMs are limited to specific tasks and regions, lacking diversity. The study aims to fill this gap with a comprehensive dataset for AGB estimation.

Method: The dataset combines hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from EnMAP satellite and AGB density estimates from GEDI lidars, covering seven continental regions. Geo-FMs are evaluated against a baseline U-Net.

Result: Geo-FMs match or surpass U-Net performance, especially with fine-tuning. Performance varies by region dataset size, and token patch size in Vision Transformers affects accuracy.

Conclusion: The dataset supports Geo-FM development and evaluation, enabling research on geographic bias and generalization. It will be publicly released.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

*Sahar Nasirihaghighi,Negin Ghamsarian,Leonie Peschek,Matteo Munari,Heinrich Husslein,Raphael Sznitman,Klaus Schoeffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GynSurg, a large, multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopy, addressing limitations of existing datasets to improve surgical scene understanding and action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for gynecologic laparoscopy are limited in scale, task focus, or annotation detail, hindering comprehensive workflow analysis.

Method: The authors introduce GynSurg, a dataset with rich annotations for multiple tasks, and benchmark state-of-the-art models using it.

Result: GynSurg is demonstrated to be high-quality and versatile, supporting applications like action recognition and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly released to accelerate progress in surgical video analysis and computer-assisted intervention.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

*Yihan Wu,Xuehao Cui,Ruibo Chen,Georgios Milis,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes C-reweight, a distortion-free watermarking method for image generation models to address retokenization mismatch and improve detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of image generation models (e.g., deepfakes, phishing) necessitates robust authenticity verification, but traditional watermarking methods face challenges in image models.

Method: Introduces C-reweight, a clustering-based strategy to mitigate retokenization mismatch while preserving image fidelity.

Result: C-reweight maintains visual quality and outperforms existing distortion-free watermarking techniques in detectability.

Conclusion: C-reweight sets a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis by addressing key limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

### [34] [Scalable Context-Preserving Model-Aware Deep Clustering for Hyperspectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11377)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Nikos Deligiannis,Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) that jointly captures local and non-local structures, reducing complexity to O(n).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods for HSIs are computationally intensive (O(n^2)) and lack effective supervision of the entire clustering process by combining local and non-local spatial structures.

Method: Proposes a one-stage approach with spatial smoothness (local) and mini-cluster-based (non-local) constraints, jointly optimized for efficient clustering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with O(n) complexity, making it scalable for large HSIs.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines local and non-local structures, offering a computationally efficient solution for HSI clustering.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

### [35] [Enhance Multimodal Consistency and Coherence for Text-Image Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11380)
*Xiaoxin Lu,Ranran Haoran Zhang,Yusen Zhang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating text-image plans addresses alignment and coherence challenges, outperforming baselines on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focuses on textual plan generation, leaving multimodal (text-image) plans understudied. Challenges include modality alignment and visual coherence.

Method: Proposes a step-by-step framework: drafts textual steps, edits visual steps, extracts PDDL-like info, and refines drafts. Works with models like Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o.

Result: Evaluated on 1,100 tasks across 11 topics, the approach shows effectiveness in multimodal consistency and coherence.

Conclusion: The framework improves multimodal plan generation and is adaptable to various backbone models.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

### [36] [Dynamic Double Space Tower](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11394)
*Weikai Sun,Shijie Song,Han Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dynamic bidirectional spatial tower method enhances VQA models by improving spatial reasoning and cross-modal interaction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods struggle with complex reasoning due to weak cross-modal interaction and poor spatial relationship capture.

Method: Proposes a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower with four layers, inspired by human gestalt vision, to better organize and perceive image content.

Result: The method improves spatial reasoning, works with any multimodal model, and achieves state-of-the-art results, especially on spatial relation datasets.

Conclusion: The dynamic spatial tower significantly enhances VQA performance, demonstrating strong potential for spatial relationship processing.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

*Dokyoon Yoon,Youngsook Song,Woomyong Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A preference learning method, \mymethod, reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by targeting specific areas where errors occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs undermine reliability, especially in tasks requiring accurate object identification.

Method: Preference learning is applied to a dataset of hallucinated and correct responses, focusing on targeted areas to filter irrelevant signals.

Result: \mymethod effectively reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks without degrading overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves MLLM reliability by addressing hallucinations directly.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect automates skeletal rigging by preserving connectivity via tokenization, reward-guided optimization, and geodesic-aware bone selection, improving topological accuracy and skinning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for skeletal rigging often fail to preserve connectivity or require manual adjustments, leading to inaccuracies and artifacts. Auto-Connect aims to automate and improve this process.

Method: The method uses connectivity-preserving tokenization, a topology-aware reward function for fine-tuning, and implicit geodesic features for bone selection.

Result: The approach generates anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties and reduced skinning artifacts.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect outperforms previous methods by integrating connectivity, topology, and geodesic awareness into a unified framework.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

*Jie Zhu,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a black-box auditing framework (FSCA) for text-to-image diffusion models, addressing copyright and privacy concerns without needing internal model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auditing methods for text-to-image models rely on unrealistic assumptions or unreliable evaluations, creating a gap for practical solutions.

Method: FSCA uses semantic connections within the model for auditing, avoiding internal knowledge access. Includes recall balance and threshold adjustment strategies.

Result: FSCA outperforms 8 baselines on LAION-mi and COCO datasets, achieving 90% user-level accuracy with minimal samples.

Conclusion: FSCA is effective and practical for real-world auditing, demonstrating superior performance and potential.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAViS is a framework combining ImageBind and SAM2 for AVS, using text-bridged hybrid prompting and alignment supervision to address cross-modal alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of aligning audio and visual modalities in AVS by leveraging multimodal foundation models effectively.

Method: Introduces TAViS, coupling ImageBind for cross-modal alignment and SAM2 for segmentation, with text-bridged hybrid prompting and alignment supervision.

Result: Superior performance on single-source, multi-source, semantic datasets, and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: TAViS effectively combines foundation models and text-bridged design to improve AVS performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning model with uncertainty awareness improves cancer subtyping by strategically selecting annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cancer subtyping models by incorporating uncertainty awareness, reducing reliance on extensive expert annotations while improving precision.

Method: Introduces uncertainty awareness via an evidence vector to assess model confidence, using the uncertainty score to selectively label crucial images for iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1-10% of strategically selected annotations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method minimizes the need for labeled data, improves classification efficiency, and is promising for digital pathology with limited labeled datasets.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V2LMs (Vehicle Vision Language Models) improve AV perception robustness against adversarial attacks without adversarial training, outperforming traditional DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs in AVs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses degrade benign accuracy or fail to generalize.

Method: Introduces V2LMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, evaluated in Solo Mode (task-specific) and Tandem Mode (multi-task).

Result: V2LMs maintain <8% accuracy drop under attacks vs. DNNs' 33-46% drop. Tandem Mode is memory-efficient and robust.

Conclusion: V2LMs enhance AV perception security and resilience, offering a promising alternative to traditional DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a lightweight framework for attributing face-swap Deepfakes to their generative models, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Deepfake videos threatens digital security and media integrity, but most research focuses on binary detection, leaving model attribution underexplored.

Method: FAME uses spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to capture generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models.

Result: FAME outperforms existing methods on datasets like DFDM, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb in accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: FAME is effective for real-world forensic and security applications due to its lightweight and efficient design.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

*Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Hongje Seong,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Environmental Change Detection (ECD), a practical task for detecting scene changes without relying on perfectly aligned reference images, using a novel framework that leverages multiple references and semantic aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Scene Change Detection (SCD) assumes idealized conditions with perfectly aligned reference images, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to address this by proposing ECD, which relies on environmental cues from uncurated images.

Method: The proposed framework avoids matching at identical spatial locations due to viewpoint misalignment. Instead, it uses multiple reference candidates and aggregates semantically rich representations for change detection.

Result: The framework outperforms naive combinations of state-of-the-art methods and achieves performance comparable to the oracle setting on three benchmark sets.

Conclusion: ECD is a more practical approach to change detection, and the proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional SCD by leveraging environmental cues and semantic aggregation.

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Efthymia Amarantidou,Christos Koutlis,Symeon Papadopoulos,Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced Synthetic Image Detection (SID) method using data augmentation and genetic algorithms to improve detection of AI-generated images altered by real-world perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated synthetic images on social media threatens information integrity, and current SID methods fail under real-world alterations like compression.

Method: The research explores data augmentation combinations, uses a genetic algorithm for optimal augmentation selection, and introduces dual-criteria optimization.

Result: The best model achieves a +22.53% mean average precision improvement over non-augmented models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances SID robustness against real-world perturbations, offering insights for future detection models.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average

### [46] [Preserving Clusters in Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11493)
*Tung-Long Vuong,Hoang Phan,Vy Vo,Anh Bui,Thanh-Toan Do,Trung Le,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve pseudo-labels in UDA by leveraging the geometry of visual and text embeddings in pre-trained models like CLIP, addressing deviations in embedding distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods using CLIP rely on pseudo-labels and self-training, but visual embedding deviations in target domains can misguide class descriptions.

Method: The approach uses source-target visual embedding relationships and optimal transport theory to enforce clustering in text embeddings, enhancing alignment.

Result: Experiments show superior performance and better target prompt quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses embedding distribution deviations, improving UDA performance.

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manager, a lightweight plugin for Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that enhances performance by adaptively aggregating insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts. It outperforms baselines on downstream tasks and also boosts zero-shot performance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in BridgeTower, such as ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations and restricted exploitation of semantic knowledge, the paper proposes Manager for better VL alignment and fusion.

Method: ManagerTower, a novel VLM, integrates the Manager plugin in each cross-modal layer. It is evaluated under the Two-Tower VLM and MLLM architectures, with and without VL pre-training.

Result: ManagerTower outperforms baselines on 4 downstream VL tasks and significantly improves zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across 20 datasets. The synergy of Manager and the multi-grid algorithm enhances visual representation.

Conclusion: Manager is an effective plugin for VLMs and MLLMs, improving performance by capturing diverse visual details. Its synergy with the multi-grid algorithm mitigates semantic ambiguity and further enhances results.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

*Samuel Cerezo,Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GNSS-inertial initialization strategy delays global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available, using relative distance residuals initially and a Hessian-based criterion for switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor initial estimates from limited measurements can lead to local minima in non-linear optimization, necessitating a better initialization method.

Method: The method uses GNSS relative distance residuals initially, switching to global measurements based on Hessian matrix singular values.

Result: Outperforms naive global GNSS usage, providing more accurate and robust initializations on EuRoC and GVINS datasets.

Conclusion: Delaying global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available improves initialization accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

*Zhuguanyu Wu,Shihe Wang,Jiayi Zhang,Jiaxin Chen,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIMA-Q is a novel post-training quantization method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that improves accuracy, especially in low-bit quantization, by leveraging KL divergence and a diagonal plus low-rank FIM approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PTQ methods for ViTs suffer from significant accuracy degradation, particularly in low-bit quantization, due to limitations in Hessian-guided quantization loss.

Method: The proposed FIMA-Q method connects KL divergence with Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for fast quantization loss computation and introduces DPLR-FIM, an efficient FIM approximation.

Result: Extensive experiments show FIMA-Q outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, especially for low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q offers a promising solution for PTQ in ViTs, enhancing accuracy without retraining, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Result: Validated on real-world and synthetic datasets, outperforming bi-temporal baselines; scalable across disaster types.

Conclusion: SITS-Extreme offers a scalable, effective solution for large-scale disaster monitoring.

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such
events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose
SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

*Yinlong Liu,Tianyu Huang,Zhi-Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reformulates rotation estimation as a linear model fitting problem, introduces a voting-based method using quaternion spheres, and demonstrates robustness and speed via GPU parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust rotation estimation is critical for safety-critical applications, but traditional methods are non-linear and non-convex. This work seeks a simpler, more efficient approach.

Method: Reformulates rotation estimation as a linear problem, uses quaternion sphere great circles, and proposes a voting-based method optimized for GPU parallelization.

Result: Achieves exceptional robustness to noise/outliers and solves large-scale (10^6) problems with 99% outliers in under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The method is theoretically and empirically validated, proving superior robustness and efficiency for rotation estimation.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA is a novel VQA framework using free-energy-based self-repair, featuring a dual-branch architecture for global and fine-grained analysis, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems struggle with spatiotemporal complexity and backbone constraints, limiting enhancement module integration.

Method: Proposes EyeSimVQA with dual branches (aesthetic and technical) and specialized enhancement modules, plus a biologically inspired prediction head.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five VQA benchmarks with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA effectively addresses VQA challenges through adaptive repair and biologically grounded design.

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

*Bo-Cheng Chiu,Jen-Jee Chen,Yu-Chee Tseng,Feng-Chi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMO is a data-efficient Video LLM designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding, outperforming prior methods in tasks requiring precise temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal reasoning, limiting their ability to attribute responses to specific video moments under constrained supervision.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for capturing temporal dynamics and fusing visual/audio data, plus a global residual for efficiency. Training involves a four-stage progressive paradigm.

Result: DaMO surpasses prior methods in temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks, excelling in precise temporal alignment tasks.

Conclusion: DaMO advances data-efficient video-language modeling, offering improved temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

*Jiachen Yu,Yufei Zhan,Ziheng Wu,Yousong Zhu,Jinqiao Wang,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cue-driven editing pipeline and VFaith-Bench to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning faithfulness, revealing the relationship between reasoning and visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of long CoT in enhancing MLLMs' problem-solving is unclear, necessitating a method to evaluate their visual reasoning faithfulness.

Method: Developed an automatic editing pipeline (GPT-Image-1) and VFaith-Bench, a benchmark with 755 entries, to test MLLMs' visual reasoning and perception.

Result: The benchmark and pipeline reveal the connection between reasoning accuracy and visual cues, with specific metrics quantifying this relationship.

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench provides a tool to analyze MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, highlighting the importance of visual faithfulness in their performance.

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: A CNN-based method (YOLOv8s) is proposed for detecting lifted truck axles in real-time, achieving high precision (87%) and recall (91.7%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WIM systems fail to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles, and few methods exist for this detection.

Method: Uses YOLOv8s CNN on images captured by traffic cameras to detect lifted axles.

Result: Achieved 87% precision, 91.7% recall, and 1.4 ms inference time, suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: The method is effective but could improve with larger datasets or image augmentation.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overlapping features in 3D maps reduce precision; OV-MAP aims to solve this by improving instance-level segmentation.

Method: Uses class-agnostic 2D segmentation, merges raw/synthetic depth, and employs 3D mask voting for zero-shot 3D instance segmentation.

Result: Demonstrates superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability on datasets like ScanNet200 and Replica, plus real-world tests.

Conclusion: OV-MAP is effective for open-world 3D mapping, offering accurate segmentation without 3D supervision.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Conclusion: EasyARC advances the evaluation of vision-language models by providing a scalable, verifiable benchmark for true reasoning and test-time scaling, with open-sourced dataset and code.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and

scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation is costly and error-prone. Active Label Correction (ALC) addresses this but remains inefficient.

Method: A$^2$LC integrates automated correction using annotator feedback and introduces an adaptively balanced acquisition function for underrepresented classes.

Result: A$^2$LC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 27.23% improvement on Cityscapes with equivalent budget and higher efficiency.

Conclusion: A$^2$LC is a highly efficient and effective solution for label correction in semantic segmentation, validated on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal method for WiFi-based human behavior recognition using phase and DFS data fusion improves accuracy via dual-branch self-attention and group attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single data types, missing the benefits of feature interaction and fusion.

Method: Proposes a multimodal approach with dual-branch self-attention for spatial-temporal cues and group attention for feature fusion, optimized via a gating mechanism.

Result: Outperforms on Widar3.0 and XRF55 datasets in in-domain and cross-domain tests.

Conclusion: The method enhances recognition accuracy by effectively fusing and optimizing multimodal features.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

TL;DR: SignAligner, a novel method for realistic sign language generation, uses text-driven pose modalities, online collaborative correction, and video synthesis to improve accuracy and expressiveness in sign videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of sign language, involving hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements, makes realistic generation challenging.

Method: SignAligner consists of three stages: text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and realistic video synthesis, leveraging Transformer-based text encoding and cross-modal attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show SignAligner enhances the accuracy and expressiveness of generated sign videos.

Conclusion: SignAligner addresses the challenges of realistic sign language generation, offering a robust solution with improved performance.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fairness evaluation technique for ML in image classification, focusing on skin color as tensor data without rigid categorization, using probability distributions and statistical distance measures. It also proposes a training method to mitigate biases in skin tone categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness in ML, especially for skin color in image classification, which differs from categorical attributes like gender or race, and lacks prior nuanced evaluation methods.

Method: Converts skin color tensor data into probability distributions, applies statistical distance measures, and uses Bayesian regression with polynomial functions for bias mitigation.

Result: Enables fine-grained fairness evaluation within and across groups, offering a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances fairness in ML by handling skin color more accurately and mitigating biases, contributing to Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

### [62] [DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional Distance Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11653)
*Emre Kavak,Tom Nuno Wolf,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM, a model to address prediction shortcuts like lighting conditions in image tasks, and DISCO, a regularization method for bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models may use irrelevant signals (e.g., lighting) for predictions due to bias, leading to undesirable shortcuts.

Method: SAM provides a causal framework; DISCO uses conditional distance correlation for conditional independence in regression.

Result: DISCO achieves competitive results in bias mitigation, proving effective against kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: SAM and DISCO offer robust solutions for avoiding prediction shortcuts and bias in models.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

*Yunhan Ren,Ruihuang Li,Lingbo Liu,Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline for prohibited items in X-ray images, leveraging SAM and a bilayer mask decoder to address appearance gaps and overlapping objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, along with severe overlapping, makes instance segmentation challenging.

Method: Integrates SAM for representation gap and designs an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder for overlapping objects. Uses manually annotated occlusion datasets PIDray-A and PIXray-A.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on occlusion-annotated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses challenges in X-ray image segmentation, with datasets and code made available.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

### [64] [Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts for Continual Multimodal Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11672)
*Chendi Ge,Xin Wang,Zeyang Zhang,Hong Chen,Jiapei Fan,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes D-MoLE, a method for continual multimodal instruction tuning in MLLMs, addressing task architecture conflict and modality imbalance by dynamically evolving the model's architecture under parameter budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for continual multimodal instruction tuning use fixed architectures, limiting adaptability to new tasks. The paper aims to solve this by dynamically evolving the model's architecture.

Method: D-MoLE introduces a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator for LoRA experts and a gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum to balance modality updates.

Result: D-MoLE achieves a 15% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: This is the first study to address continual learning in MLLMs from an architectural perspective, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

### [65] [Cross-Modal Clustering-Guided Negative Sampling for Self-Supervised Joint Learning from Medical Images and Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11674)
*Libin Lan,Hongxing Li,Zunhui Xia,Juan Zhou,Xiaofei Zhu,Yongmei Li,Yudong Zhang,Xin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-CGNS, a method for medical visual representation learning, addressing limitations like poor negative sampling and lack of fine-grained details. It uses cross-modal clustering and masked image reconstruction to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for medical visual representation learning suffer from poor negative sampling, neglect of fine-grained details, and focus on high-level features while ignoring low-level ones.

Method: Proposes CM-CGNS: 1) Cross-modal k-means clustering for better negative sampling, and 2) Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction (CM-MIR) to retain low-level features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five datasets.

Conclusion: CM-CGNS effectively addresses key limitations, improving medical visual representation learning for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

*Zacharia Mesbah,Dhruv Jain,Tsiry Mayet,Romain Modzelewski,Romain Herault,Simon Bernard,Sebastien Thureau,Clement Chatelain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a three-stage method using nn-Unet for airway segmentation, radiomic feature extraction, and SVM classification to predict survival in lung fibrosis patients, achieving scores of 0.8601 and 0.7346 for segmentation and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the predictive value of airway imaging biomarkers for survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients.

Method: 1. nn-Unet for airway segmentation. 2. Radiomic feature extraction from trachea and airway regions. 3. SVM classifier for survival prediction.

Result: Achieved scores of 0.8601 (segmentation) and 0.7346 (classification).

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential in using airway imaging biomarkers for survival prediction in lung fibrosis.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

*MingZe Tang,Madiha Kazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study benchmarks human action recognition models on a COCO subset, showing ViT outperforms others with 90% accuracy, validated by statistical significance and explainability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of different models (fully connected networks, transformers, etc.) in human action recognition and understand their decision-making processes.

Method: Used a three-class subset of COCO, tested models including ViT, convolutional networks, and CLIP-based models, and employed ANOVA, SHAP, and LeGrad for analysis.

Result: ViT achieved 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming others (35% for CNNs, 62-64% for CLIP). ANOVA confirmed significance (F=61.37, p<0.001). ViT localized pose-specific regions, while simpler models focused on background textures.

Conclusion: Transformers like ViT are data-efficient and effective for action recognition, and explainability tools are crucial for diagnosing model errors.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

*Anshul Singh,Chris Biemann,Jan Strich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTabVQA is a new benchmark for multi-tabular visual question answering, addressing gaps in current VLMs' ability to reason across multiple table images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess VLMs' ability to parse and correlate information across diverse table images, a common real-world challenge.

Method: Introduces MTabVQA with 3,745 complex QA pairs requiring multi-hop reasoning across table images. Evaluates VLMs and proposes post-training techniques.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show significant limitations on MTabVQA. Fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct improves performance.

Conclusion: MTabVQA fills a critical gap in evaluating and enhancing VLMs' multi-tabular reasoning, with promising results from instruction-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

*Libin Lan,Hongxing Li,Zunhui Xia,Yudong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMAF-Net addresses modality imbalance in medical image segmentation with dynamic fusion, distillation, and adaptive training strategies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in real-world scenarios due to idealized assumptions of complete modality availability, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes DMAF-Net with Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion, Relation and Prototype Distillation, and Dynamic Training Monitoring.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 datasets.

Conclusion: DMAF-Net effectively handles incomplete multi-modal data, improving segmentation performance in clinical settings.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and
MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with plug-and-play techniques shows promise for Interleave tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the

model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and

TL;DR: DiffFuSR is a modular pipeline for super-resolving Sentinel-2 imagery to 2.5m GSD, combining diffusion-based SR and fusion networks, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Sentinel-2 imagery resolution uniformly across all spectral bands, addressing limitations in current super-resolution and pansharpening methods.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) diffusion-based SR trained on high-res RGB data, (2) fusion network upscaling multispectral bands using SR-RGB as a spatial prior. Includes degradation modeling for blind SR.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines in fidelity, spectral consistency, and spatial alignment. Fusion network surpasses classical pansharpening for 20m/60m bands.

Conclusion: Harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion strategies enables effective Sentinel-2 SR, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion

TL;DR: MambaVSR introduces a state-space model framework for video super-resolution, addressing challenges in non-local dependencies and computational efficiency with innovative content-aware scanning and global-local integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods struggle with large motion displacements and long sequences due to reliance on optical flow or transformers.

Method: MambaVSR uses Shared Compass Construction (SCC) for semantic connectivity and Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS) for aligning non-local content, combined with Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) for detail recovery.

Result: MambaVSR outperforms Transformer-based methods by 0.58 dB PSNR on REDS dataset with 55% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaVSR effectively balances global dependencies and local details, offering a superior and efficient solution for VSR.

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION combines discriminative (CLIP) and generative (diffusion) models for anomaly detection, excelling in capturing global and local features with limited data, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to ambiguous definitions, diverse anomaly types, and scarce training data, requiring a model that captures both low-level and high-level features.

Method: CLIPFUSION integrates CLIP for global features and diffusion models for local details, using cross-attention and feature maps for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms baselines on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in anomaly segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: Multi-modal and multi-model fusion is effective for anomaly detection, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: AgentSense uses virtual data generation with LLMs to create diverse HAR datasets, improving model performance with limited real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of diverse, labeled datasets for robust HAR systems due to variability in home layouts and user behavior.

Method: AgentSense pipeline generates personas via LLMs, simulates routines in VirtualHome with ambient sensors, and creates virtual datasets.

Result: Virtual data boosts HAR performance, matching real-data models when combined with minimal real data.

Conclusion: AgentSense proves virtual data's potential to solve HAR's data scarcity without manual collection.

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

*Abhishek Jaiswal,Armeet Singh Luthra,Purav Jangir,Bhavya Garg,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time feedback system for isometric exercises is introduced to address risks like incorrect posture and injury, using a large dataset and novel metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Isometric exercises lack expert supervision, leading to risks such as injury and disengagement. The paper aims to provide real-time corrective feedback.

Method: The system uses a large multiclass isometric exercise video dataset (3,600 clips) and benchmarks state-of-the-art models, including graph-based networks, with a novel three-part metric.

Result: The system improves feasibility for intelligent, personalized home workouts and extends applications to rehabilitation and physiotherapy.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances safety and effectiveness of isometric exercises, with broader applications in fitness and healthcare.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISCOVR is a self-supervised dual-branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning, combining clustering-based video encoding with fine-grained spatial semantics extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in echocardiography (e.g., subtle structures, low PSNR) limit existing SSL methods, necessitating domain-specific solutions.

Method: DISCOVR integrates a video encoder for temporal dynamics and an image encoder for spatial semantics, linked via semantic cluster distillation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot, linear probing, and segmentation transfer across six datasets.

Conclusion: DISCOVR advances SSL in echocardiography by combining temporal and spatial learning, offering superior performance and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

### [78] [GPLQ: A General, Practical, and Lightning QAT Method for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11784)
*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ introduces a fast, efficient, and general framework for 4-bit ViT quantization, addressing PTQ and QAT limitations with a two-stage approach that preserves model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ and QAT methods for ViT quantization have significant drawbacks: PTQ causes accuracy drops, while QAT is computationally expensive and lacks generalization.

Method: GPLQ uses a two-stage strategy: Stage 1 quantizes activations while keeping weights in FP32, and Stage 2 quantizes weights with PTQ. This preserves the model's optimization 'basin' and ensures generalization.

Result: GPLQ is 100x faster than QAT, reduces memory usage below FP32 training, and achieves competitive 4-bit model performance on ImageNet and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GPLQ is a practical, efficient solution for ViT quantization, offering high accuracy and generalization with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

*Filippo Bragato,Michael Neri,Paolo Testolina,Marco Giordani,Federica Battisti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving Teleoperated Driving (TD) by detecting cars and pedestrians using point cloud data, evaluating compression algorithms and object detectors, and assessing their impact on V2X networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of interconnected devices and advanced hardware/software has boosted TD, but safe operations require accurate object detection from sensor data.

Method: The study uses the SELMA dataset, enhanced with ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, to test compression algorithms and object detectors, measuring performance across multiple metrics.

Result: The analysis evaluates compression efficiency, inference time, detection accuracy, and V2X network impact (data rate, latency) against 3GPP standards.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into optimizing TD systems by balancing detection accuracy and network performance, ensuring safe and efficient remote driving.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

*Xintong Wang,Jingheng Pan,Yixiao Liu,Xiaohu Zhao,Chenyang Lyu,Minghao Wu,Chris Biemann,Longyue Wang,Linlong Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Translation (VLT) by analyzing data quality, model architecture, and metrics, introducing a new dataset (AibTrans), benchmarking models, and proposing a robust evaluation method (DA Score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in VLT and improve translation accuracy with visual context.

Method: Analyzes VLT through data quality (introducing AibTrans), model benchmarking (11 commercial and 6 open-source models), and evaluation metrics (proposing DA Score).

Result: Reveals OCR dependency in models, contrasts generation vs. reasoning behaviors, and shows fine-tuning on high-resource languages harms cross-lingual performance.

Conclusion: Proposes balanced multilingual fine-tuning for LVLMs to adapt to VLT without losing generalization, establishing a new VLT benchmark.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

*Hendrik Königshof,Kun Li,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effective 3D object detection pipeline using cameras instead of LiDAR, focusing on all road users and leveraging 2D CNNs for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cheaper alternative to LiDAR-based 3D object detection by utilizing existing onboard cameras and improving computational efficiency.

Method: Lifts 2D vision-based algorithm results to 3D detections using cameras, employing a 2D CNN for point cloud processing to minimize computational effort.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image-based methods on the KITTI benchmark with significantly reduced runtime (one-third).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is a viable, cost-effective alternative to LiDAR for 3D object detection, especially for diverse road users, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereDrag is a novel framework for panoramic image editing, addressing challenges like boundary discontinuity and uneven pixel density using spherical geometry. It outperforms existing methods with a 10.5% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image editing is underexplored due to challenges like boundary discontinuity and projection distortions, which SphereDrag aims to solve.

Method: SphereDrag uses adaptive reprojection (AR), great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA), and spherical search region tracking (SSRT) for accurate editing.

Result: Experiments show SphereDrag improves geometric consistency and image quality by up to 10.5% over existing methods.

Conclusion: SphereDrag effectively tackles panoramic editing challenges and sets a benchmark with PanoBench for future research.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data from satellites is crucial for large-scale or inaccessible areas, but measuring its resolution is vital for mission utility and tracking improvements.

Method: The study describes 3D metric evaluation tools and workflows for automated resolution assessment, using high-resolution airborne lidar as a reference.

Result: Analyses were conducted on data of varying quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation methods.

*F. Gao,Y Li,X He,J Sun,J Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O2Former, an instance segmentation framework for SAR ship imagery, improves performance by addressing scale variation, object density, and fuzzy boundaries with optimized query generation and orientation-aware embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook challenges in SAR ship imagery like scale variation, object density, and fuzzy boundaries, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: O2Former extends Mask2Former with an Optimized Query Generator (OQG) for multi-scale feature interaction and an Orientation-Aware Embedding Module (OAEM) for directional sensitivity.

Result: O2Former outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in SAR ship instance segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges and enhances segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for aligned novel view image and geometry generation using warping-and-inpainting, cross-modal attention distillation, and proximity-based mesh conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods requiring dense posed images or pose-embedded models, enabling robust novel-view synthesis and geometry prediction.

Method: Leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors, formulates novel-view synthesis as inpainting, and uses cross-modal attention distillation and proximity-based mesh conditioning.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis, competitive reconstruction, and geometrically aligned colored point clouds.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates image and geometry generation, improving alignment and robustness for 3D completion.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm was compared to a commercial infrared eye tracker (Tobii Pro Nano) to assess feasibility under realistic mobile conditions. The algorithm used MobileNet-V3 and LSTM for gaze prediction, achieving comparable accuracy but with higher sensitivity to factors like lighting, vision correction, and age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation in realistic mobile usage conditions and compare its performance to a commercial infrared eye tracker.

Method: The study employed a lightweight CNN (MobileNet-V3) combined with LSTM to predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Data from 51 participants were collected using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured via Euclidean distance.

Result: The deep-learning model achieved a mean error of 17.76 mm vs. 16.53 mm for Tobii Pro Nano. It was more sensitive to lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates in low-light, glasses users, and older participants.

Conclusion: Appearance-based gaze estimation shows promise for mobile use but is more affected by environmental and user-specific factors. The study provides a framework for evaluating gaze systems in diverse conditions.

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

### [87] [How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11976)
*Constantin Venhoff,Ashkan Khakzar,Sonia Joseph,Philip Torr,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) align visual and linguistic representations by using a frozen LLM and ViT, connected via a linear adapter. It analyzes alignment using pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to reveal layer-wise progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the alignment mechanisms in VLMs, which remain unclear, and evaluating if current adapter-based architectures optimally support cross-modal learning.

Method: A framework with frozen LLM and ViT, connected by a trainable linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. SAEs are used as probes to analyze alignment.

Result: Visual representations align with language features in middle-to-later layers, indicating misalignment in early layers.

Conclusion: Current adapter-based architectures may not optimally facilitate cross-modal learning, raising questions for future research.

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

TL;DR: A lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework improves radiology report generation by integrating medical priors and dynamic inference depth adjustment, outperforming baselines without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) in radiology report generation without additional training.

Method: Introduces TGT framework for organ-specific reasoning and applies reasoning budget forcing to dynamically adjust inference depth.

Result: Outperforms baseline prompting methods, generates more accurate reports, and reveals dataset biases.

Conclusion: TGT with dynamic inference depth adjustment is effective for improving VLLM performance in radiology, offering reproducibility and traceability.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGR is a multimodal reasoning model that enhances visual perception for complex tasks, outperforming baselines with fewer image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address language bias and narrow focus of existing CoT reasoning methods by improving visual detail understanding.

Method: VGR detects relevant image regions, replays them for reasoning, and uses a custom SFT dataset (VGR-SFT) for training.

Result: Achieves +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and +12.9 on ChartQA with 30% fewer image tokens than baseline.

Conclusion: VGR effectively integrates visual grounding into reasoning, improving performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if automated CT scan metrics can improve prediction of colectomy outcomes, either alone or combined with clinical variables.

Method: Used Cox proportional hazards model for 1-year mortality and logistic regression for complications. Analyzed over 300 CT-derived features (e.g., muscle area, fat areas) and NSQIP scores.

Result: Predictive performance evaluated via C-index, IBS, AUC, and Brier Score. Individual metrics showed associations with outcomes (e.g., ORs for complications).

Conclusion: CT-derived body composition metrics are valuable for predicting postoperative outcomes, potentially enhancing existing risk predictors.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.

*Junha Lee,Eunha Park,Chunghyun Park,Dahyun Kang,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Affogato is a large-scale benchmark for affordance grounding, addressing challenges like fine-grained localization and dataset scarcity. It includes 150K instances with text descriptions and 3D heatmaps, enabling effective vision-language models for open-vocabulary generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of affordance grounding is critical for intelligent agents but faces challenges like part-level localization ambiguity and lack of large datasets.

Method: Developed Affogato, a dataset with 150K instances, and vision-language models using pretrained part-aware backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder.

Result: Models trained with Affogato perform well on 2D/3D benchmarks and show strong open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Affogato provides a valuable resource and effective models for affordance grounding, advancing interaction understanding in AI.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

### [92] [A Survey of Task-Oriented Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Status, Applications, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11012)
*Guanglin Niu,Bo Li,Yangguang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey of Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR), categorizing approaches by tasks, applications, and challenges, while also exploring advanced techniques like LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic review covering all KGR tasks, downstream applications, and challenging paradigms, the paper aims to offer a holistic perspective on KGR research.

Method: The survey categorizes KGR approaches into primary reasoning tasks, downstream applications, and challenging tasks, and examines advanced techniques like LLMs.

Result: The work highlights key research trends and outlines future directions in KGR, emphasizing the role of advanced technologies.

Conclusion: The survey fills a gap in KGR literature by providing a comprehensive review and identifying promising future research avenues.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

### [93] [OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023)
*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic,Barbara Gallina,Ingmar Kessler,Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoGSN is an ontology and middleware for managing Assurance Cases (ACs) in the GSN standard, addressing challenges in maintaining and updating ACs with automated knowledge representation and queryable graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing ACs is challenging due to the effort required to maintain embedded knowledge amid changes, often deterring developers or leading to poorly managed cases.

Method: OntoGSN formalizes the GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules, includes a helper ontology, parser, SPARQL query library, and prototypical interface.

Result: The ontology adheres to the GSN standard, evaluated via FAIR principles, OOPS framework, competency questions, and community feedback.

Conclusion: OntoGSN demonstrates utility in dynamic AC management, exemplified by assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge, combining fuzzy logic and LLMs to automate and align clinical communication skills evaluation with physician preferences, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalable and nuanced automated evaluation of medical students' clinical communication skills, aligning with subjective physician judgments.

Method: Combines fuzzy logic and LLMs, fine-tuning LLMs with human annotations from fuzzy sets (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction) for evaluation.

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80% accuracy, with major criteria items exceeding 90%, providing interpretable and human-aligned assessments.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of fuzzy logic and LLMs for human-aligned automated evaluation in medical education, enhancing assessment robustness.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

### [95] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun,Chengzhang Li,Dhrubojyoti Roy,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUDAS is a UDA framework for multi-label sound classification in IoT, optimizing resource use and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods are unsuitable for multi-label tasks and resource-constrained IoT devices, especially in urban sound classification.

Method: MUDAS selectively retrains classifiers in situ, uses adaptive thresholds for pseudo-labels, and applies diversity regularization.

Result: MUDAS outperforms existing UDA algorithms on the SONYC-UST dataset in accuracy and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: MUDAS effectively addresses multi-label UDA challenges in IoT, offering a practical solution for urban sound classification.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

### [96] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemTable is a benchmark for chemical tables, addressing multimodal and domain-specific challenges in chemistry. It evaluates table recognition and understanding tasks, revealing gaps in model performance compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity of chemical tables, limiting multimodal models' ability to support scientific understanding in chemistry.

Method: ChemTable is introduced, a large-scale benchmark with expert-annotated data, supporting table recognition (parsing, extraction) and understanding (QA tasks).

Result: Models perform reasonably on layout parsing but lag in QA tasks compared to humans, with notable gaps between open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: ChemTable highlights challenges in chemistry-aware table understanding and serves as a rigorous benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study tested LLM-powered conversational agents to provide mental health support for caregivers, combining PST, MI, and BCA. The best models used Few-Shot and RAG techniques, showing improved empathy and therapeutic alliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mental health challenges faced by family caregivers by leveraging LLMs for evidence-based support.

Method: Conducted a within-subject experiment with 28 caregivers evaluating four LLM configurations, integrating PST, MI, and BCA.

Result: Best models (Few-Shot + RAG) improved empathy and therapeutic alliance, offering personalized support and actionable strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for empathetic, tailored caregiver support, though balancing assessment and advice remains a challenge.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [98] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun,Boao Zhang,Jiayi Lu,Xinjie Feng,Jiachen Shang,Rui Cao,Mengchao Zheng,Chuanye Wang,Shichun Yang,Yaoguang Cao,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FocalAD is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves planning by focusing on critical local interactions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion prediction methods ignore critical local interactions, which can obscure risks and reduce planning reliability.

Method: FocalAD uses two modules: ELAI for graph-based ego-centric interaction representation and FLA Loss to prioritize decision-critical agents.

Result: FocalAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing collision rates by 41.9% and 15.6% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: FocalAD enhances autonomous driving reliability by focusing on local interactions, proving its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Local State Attention module for autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments to improve conflict resolution and generalization in MARL tasks, showing efficiency in highway merging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with local conflicts and stochastic events in mixed-traffic settings, necessitating better state representation for MARL.

Method: Introduces a Local State Attention module using self-attention to compress nearby agents' information, tested in a simulated highway merging scenario.

Result: The approach improves merging efficiency, especially in high-density traffic, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The Local State Attention module effectively enhances autonomous vehicle coordination in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a structure-aware automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework using GCNs for global channel importance, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on local heuristics or weight-based criteria, missing global structural dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model network topology, enabling topology-aware pruning. Employs a search-based approach for optimal pruning rate combinations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with models like ResNet and VGG16 in compression efficiency and accuracy retention.

Conclusion: SACP offers a fully automated, structure-aware pruning solution, reducing human intervention and improving model performance.

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

*Chenrui Cao,Liangcheng Song,Zenan Li,Xinyi Le,Xian Zhang,Hui Xue,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP+ improves automated theorem proving by integrating neuro-symbolic methods without additional training, achieving competitive results and solving previously unsolved problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that careful coordination of existing reasoning models and provers can match RL-based training performance without additional training.

Method: Enhances the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework with fine-grained neuro-symbolic improvements for each phase: draft (subgoal generation), sketch (autoformalization), and prove (symbolic search integration).

Result: DSP+ solves 80.7%, 32.8%, and 24 problems from miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, and solves an IMO problem unsolved by prior work.

Conclusion: DSP+ shows the potential of classical reasoning patterns alongside RL-based methods, with open-sourced components.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ enhances RAG by integrating application-aware reasoning, improving performance by 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG paradigms lack explicit application of retrieved knowledge, creating a gap in task-specific reasoning.

Method: RAG+ introduces a dual corpus of knowledge and application examples, retrieved jointly to enable structured reasoning.

Result: RAG+ outperforms standard RAG, showing 3-5% average gains and up to 7.5% in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: RAG+ bridges retrieval and application, advancing a more interpretable and capable framework for LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

*Byeongchan Lee,Jonghoon Lee,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for small and large LLMs to collaborate at test time, combining strengths of free local deployment and strong reasoning, reducing reliance on costly APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between costly large LLMs and freely available but weaker small LLMs by enabling collaboration.

Method: A planner model generates high-level plans to guide a reasoner model, with small and large models alternating roles in a multi-round cascade.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to proprietary models while reducing paid inference costs.

Conclusion: Planning is an effective prior for cost-aware, cross-model collaboration under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

TL;DR: A new German-language benchmark dataset evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on visual reasoning tasks tied to middle school curricula, revealing significant performance gaps, especially in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing English benchmarks often use artificial or decontextualized problems, lacking real-world relevance. This dataset addresses the need for evaluating VLMs on tasks requiring integration of visual and factual reasoning in German.

Method: The dataset includes 2,000 open-ended questions based on 486 images from nine middle school domains. Thirteen state-of-the-art VLMs were evaluated for domain-specific accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Result: Top models scored under 45% accuracy, with notable weaknesses in music, math, and adversarial questions. Results highlight discrepancies between benchmark performance and real-world multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: Middle school tasks are a valuable, underused way to test VLMs, especially in non-English settings. The dataset provides a rigorous testbed for improving AI's visual and linguistic reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

TL;DR: SymMPO improves MLLMs by introducing symmetric preference learning with direct supervision, outperforming existing methods in hallucination mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing hallucination in MLLMs lack rigorous optimization and direct supervision, prompting the need for SymMPO.

Method: SymMPO uses symmetric preference learning with direct supervision and a preference margin consistency loss to regulate preference gaps.

Result: SymMPO outperforms existing methods across five benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucination.

Conclusion: SymMPO provides a rigorous and effective solution for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

### [106] [Relational GNNs Cannot Learn $C_2$ Features for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11721)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-GNNs, a GNN-based approach for learning value functions in planning domains, cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features despite theoretical connections. Alternative GNN architectures may perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the limitations of R-GNNs in learning value functions defined by $C_2$ features in planning domains, despite theoretical links to $C_2$ logic.

Method: The study analyzes the expressive power of R-GNNs in relation to $C_2$ features and compares them to prior GNN architectures.

Result: R-GNNs fail to learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features, contrary to empirical expectations. Alternative GNN architectures are suggested.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations of R-GNNs for $C_2$ feature-based value functions and proposes better-suited GNN alternatives.

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

*Yaroslav Kivva,Sina Akbari,Saber Salehkaleybar,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation with latent confounders using multi-environment data, proposing a moment-based algorithm and identifying conditions for identifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in causal effect estimation when latent confounders are present, leveraging data from multiple environments where certain parameters vary.

Method: A moment-based algorithm is introduced, assuming invariance of the target causal effect across environments, and varying a single parameter (noise distribution or causal relationship).

Result: Identifiability is proven under specific conditions but lost if multiple parameters vary. A procedure to identify varying parameters is proposed and validated on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for causal effect estimation with latent confounders, highlighting conditions for identifiability and practical estimation methods.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

TL;DR: LLMs can democratize real estate insights by generating interpretable house price estimates using optimized In-Context Learning, though they face challenges like overconfidence and limited spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information asymmetry in the real estate market by leveraging LLMs for accessible and interpretable price estimates.

Method: Evaluate LLMs on international housing datasets using zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs effectively use hedonic variables for estimates, offering accessibility and interpretability, but struggle with overconfidence and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs improve transparency in real estate appraisal, with practical guidance for prompt optimization enhancing their performance.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLM type and agent gender influence political bias in debates, finding Neutral agents align with Democrats, Republicans shift toward Neutral, and gender affects attitudes. Echo chambers form among politically aligned agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexplored political biases and interaction dynamics of LLMs in simulating social behavior, particularly in debates.

Method: A structured multi-agent debate framework with Neutral, Republican, and Democrat LLM agents, varying LLMs, genders, and debate formats to analyze bias and attitude shifts.

Result: Neutral agents align with Democrats; Republicans shift toward Neutral. Gender influences attitudes, and politically aligned agents form echo chambers, intensifying attitudes.

Conclusion: LLM type and gender significantly impact political bias in debates, with echo chambers emerging among politically aligned agents, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how Transformers-based systems learn demographic biases, focusing on AI recruitment, and proposes a privacy-enhancing framework to mitigate gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in high-stake settings raises ethical concerns like biases, accountability, and privacy.

Method: A privacy-enhancing framework is proposed to reduce gender information in the learning pipeline, tested on two LLMs.

Result: The framework effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing data biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for bias mitigation in LLMs and demonstrates a practical solution.

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

### [111] [Towards a Cascaded LLM Framework for Cost-effective Human-AI Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11887)
*Claudio Fanconi,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cascaded LLM decision framework balances correctness, cost, and confidence by delegating tasks to base models, larger models, or humans, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance prediction correctness, cost, and confidence in human-AI decision-making by adaptively delegating tasks.

Method: A two-stage cascaded framework: deferral policy for model confidence and abstention policy for human intervention, with online learning for feedback.

Result: Outperforms single-model baselines in accuracy, reduces cost, and handles abstentions effectively.

Conclusion: The cascaded strategy is effective for question-answering tasks, balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

*Wuzhenghong Wen,Su Pan,yuwei Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Schema-R1 improves schema linking in Text-to-SQL tasks using reinforcement learning, enhancing reasoning ability and achieving a 10% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for schema linking models lack reasoning ability due to rote-learning and insufficient high-quality reasoning samples.

Method: Schema-R1 uses reinforcement learning with three steps: constructing reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement training.

Result: The method improves reasoning ability and achieves a 10% higher filter accuracy than existing approaches.

Conclusion: Schema-R1 effectively addresses the limitations of current schema linking models by leveraging reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

*Xiaopeng Yuan,Xingjian Zhang,Ke Xu,Yifan Xu,Lijun Yu,Jindong Wang,Yushun Dong,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using strategic games to evaluate LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps like planning and decision-making, introducing new metrics beyond win rate. ChatGPT-o3-mini performs best, while Qwen-Plus struggles with resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook intermediate reasoning steps in LLMs, which are crucial for understanding model behavior and reliability.

Method: A framework evaluates LLMs in strategic games, focusing on planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision-making, using metrics like correction success rate and over-budget ratio.

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini leads with a 74.7% win rate, while Qwen-Plus has high overcorrection risk (81.6%) but low win rate (25.6%). Frequent edits don't always improve outcomes.

Conclusion: Assessing how LLMs arrive at decisions is as important as the outcomes, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in benchmark results of widely used reasoning models, which makes performance claims hard to reproduce.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models under different evaluation conditions.

Result: Significant fluctuations in benchmark results due to minor changes in evaluation conditions, observed across multiple models.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed to ensure reliable and reproducible performance assessments of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEval-OS, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling, covering 15 datasets across 13 subtasks and four operational stages. It assesses 14 LLMs, showing open-source models can outperform closed-source ones in specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive benchmarks for LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling hinders exploration of their potential in this domain.

Method: Proposes TeleEval-OS, a benchmark with 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, categorizing LLM capabilities into four hierarchical levels. Evaluates 14 LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot methods.

Result: Open-source LLMs outperform closed-source ones in specific scenarios, demonstrating their potential in telecommunications operation scheduling.

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS fills a critical research gap, showcasing the value of LLMs in telecommunications and highlighting open-source models' competitive edge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates position bias in multimodal RAG systems, revealing a U-shaped accuracy curve and introducing metrics to quantify and visualize this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG models are sensitive to evidence order, leading to unstable performance and biased reasoning, especially with increased retrieval complexity or modality diversity.

Method: Controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, introducing the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI_p) and a visualization framework for attention patterns.

Result: Multimodal interactions intensify position bias, which increases logarithmically with retrieval range.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for position-aware analysis and debiasing strategies to improve RAG system reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

Motivation: To explore Russenorsk's unique linguistic features and validate modern LLMs' utility in historical language analysis.

Method: Construct a structured dictionary from literary sources, analyze word formation/grammar, and develop a translation agent.

Result: Generated hypotheses align with academic literature; a functional translation agent for Russenorsk was created.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively aid in historical language analysis, offering insights into Russenorsk's structure and potential applications.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Motivation: To reduce the documentation burden of Review of Systems (ROS) in clinical notes by automating extraction with LLMs.

Method: Pipeline uses SecTag for ROS section extraction and few-shot LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma, ChatGPT) for identifying ROS entities, their status, and body systems.

Result: ChatGPT achieved the lowest error rates (28.2% for spans, 14.5% for status/systems). Open-source LLMs also performed well (30.5-36.7% for spans, 24.3-27.3% for status/systems).

Conclusion: The pipeline is scalable and deployable locally, with open-source LLMs offering a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB), judging non-obligatory scenarios as obligations when prompts include modal expressions like 'must' or 'ought to'. A mitigation strategy using few-shot examples and reasoning prompts is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs handle moral and ethical reasoning, particularly in judging obligations, and to address the underexplored bias introduced by modal expressions.

Method: Analyzed LLM responses to commonsense scenarios with modal expressions, identifying DKB. Proposed a mitigation strategy combining few-shot examples and reasoning prompts.

Result: LLMs judged over 90% of scenarios as obligations when modal expressions were present, showing consistent bias across models and formats.

Conclusion: Modal expressions introduce bias in LLM judgments, highlighting the need for mitigation strategies to align LLM decisions with normative standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interface architecture to bridge the gap between natural language instructions and modeling languages for precise control of prototype models, enhancing Large Language Models' utility in industrial design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial designers need intuitive, language-based control for prototype models, but current methods face gaps in abstraction, precision, and lexical scope.

Method: The authors develop an interface architecture with an operational mechanism and automated domain specification algorithm, grounded in fast prototyping practices.

Result: Evaluations show the interface enables precise and effective control of prototype models across various design domains.

Conclusion: The interface serves as an auxiliary module for Large Language Models, improving targeted control in industrial design.

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM is a near training-free method to mitigate multilingual object hallucination in LVLMs by aligning cross-lingual attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit higher multilingual object hallucination in non-English queries, and existing solutions are resource-intensive.

Method: CLAIM identifies language-specific attention heads, estimates language shift vectors, and intervenes in attention outputs during inference.

Result: CLAIM improves performance by 13.56% on POPE and 21.75% on MME benchmarks, with up to 30% gains in Spanish.

Conclusion: Multilingual attention divergence is prominent in intermediate layers, emphasizing their role in multilingual scenarios.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [122] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyclicReflex, a method to optimize reflection token usage in large reasoning models (LRMs) for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection tokens in LRMs can degrade performance if overused or underused, necessitating a balanced approach.

Method: Proposes CyclicReflex, a decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts reflection token usage using a triangular waveform.

Result: CyclicReflex improves performance across model sizes and benchmarks, outperforming standard and recent methods.

Conclusion: CyclicReflex effectively manages reflection token allocation, enhancing LRM performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND is a framework for Fake News Detection (FND) that uses LLMs and experiential learning to improve evidence-based verification, addressing noise, generalization, and bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FND methods struggle with noisy evidence, poor generalization, and unclear decision-making. LLMs introduce new challenges like hallucinated rationales and bias.

Method: RoE-FND reframes FND as logical deduction, combining LLMs with experiential learning in two stages: self-reflective knowledge building and dynamic criterion retrieval.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization and effectiveness across three datasets.

Conclusion: RoE-FND offers a training-free, adaptable solution for FND, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

TL;DR: MANBench is a bilingual benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) against human performance in nine tasks, revealing MLLMs' strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether MLLMs can surpass human performance in multimodal tasks and identify gaps in their capabilities.

Method: Developed MANBench, a benchmark with 1,314 questions across nine tasks, and compared human and MLLM performance.

Result: MLLMs excel in Knowledge and Text-Image tasks but struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks like Puzzles.

Conclusion: MLLMs still fall short of human-level performance in many domains; MANBench aims to inspire improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE uses LLMs to generate valid and general grammars from natural language specs, outperforming 17 LLMs with 15.92%p and 12.34%p improvements in validity and test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid grammars from natural language specs is challenging, especially with limited supervision.

Method: Fine-tunes an open-source LLM for grammar translation and applies GRPO for validity and generality, using iterative feedback for error correction.

Result: SAGE outperforms 17 LLMs, improving grammar validity by 15.92%p and test effectiveness by 12.34%p.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates strong generalization and effectiveness in grammar generation, advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a transformer-based model for sequential clinical decision-making, outperforming baselines in predicting diagnostic pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision-making by modeling sequential diagnostic processes, addressing limitations of isolated classification methods.

Method: Uses a transformer architecture with tokenized clinical events (tests, results, diagnoses) and autoregressive training to predict next steps.

Result: Shows significant improvements in next-token prediction, generating realistic diagnostic sequences and clinician behaviors.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully applies generative language modeling to medical data, enabling decision support and future healthcare modeling advancements.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate is a multi-agent debate framework using adversarial argumentation among LLMs to identify and mitigate unsafe behaviors, reducing them by up to 23.5% with long-term memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety methods rely on costly human evaluations or single-model assessments, which lack scalability and risk oversight.

Method: RedDebate employs collaborative disagreement among LLMs, automated red-teaming, and integrates long-term memory to retain safety insights.

Result: Debate alone reduces unsafe behaviors by 17.7%; with long-term memory, reductions exceed 23.5%.

Conclusion: RedDebate is the first fully automated framework combining multi-agent debates and red-teaming to enhance AI safety without human intervention.

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPACE is a unified framework addressing factuality and faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs by editing shared activation subspaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face practical deployment issues due to factuality and faithfulness hallucinations, with current methods causing trade-offs between the two.

Method: SPACE uses dual-task feature modeling and a hybrid probe strategy (spectral clustering + attention head saliency) to edit shared subspaces.

Result: SPACE outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates both hallucination types concurrently by leveraging shared neural representations.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using LLMs for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR systems improves rare named entity recognition by 21% over self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with rare named entities and domain mismatches, while LLMs excel across domains. This work aims to bridge the gap by leveraging LLMs for better ASR performance.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a LLM as a reward model to score ASR hypotheses, fine-tuning the ASR model using these scores.

Result: Achieves a 21% improvement in entity word error rate compared to conventional self-training methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances ASR performance for rare named entities by leveraging LLMs and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT extends RAG for dynamic domains with multi-turn dialogue and evolving tools, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are static and single-turn, limiting adaptability in dynamic domains like healthcare and smart homes.

Method: DCT uses an attention-based context cache, LoRA-based retrieval, and context compression to handle evolving tools and multi-turn interactions.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 performance at lower cost.

Conclusion: DCT enables scalable, adaptable AI assistants for dynamic environments, generalizing to unseen tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid deployment of LLMs has raised safety concerns due to issues like toxicity and bias, necessitating a comprehensive review of safety evaluation efforts.

Method: The survey categorizes safety evaluation into four key aspects: why evaluate (background and significance), what to evaluate (tasks like toxicity and bias), where to evaluate (metrics and datasets), and how to evaluate (methods and toolkits).

Result: The paper identifies gaps in current safety evaluation research and highlights the need for systematic approaches to ensure safe LLM deployment.

Conclusion: Prioritizing LLM safety evaluation is crucial for real-world applications, and future research should address identified challenges to advance the field.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps in text, using BERTopic and persistent homology. It validates the approach with empirical data from "The Hunger Games," showing improved curiosity prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reader curiosity is vital for engagement but underexplored in NLP. The study aims to bridge this gap by modeling curiosity through semantic information gaps.

Method: The framework uses BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze a dynamic semantic network's topology (connected components, cycles, voids) as proxies for information gaps.

Result: The pipeline significantly improves curiosity prediction (73% vs. 30% explained deviance) compared to a baseline, using topological features from the text.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is a novel computational method for analyzing text structure and its impact on reader engagement, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

*Haritz Puerto,Martin Gubri,Tommaso Green,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-SEO Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO) methods across tasks, domains, and actors, revealing current methods' ineffectiveness compared to traditional SEO strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about the effectiveness of C-SEO methods across diverse domains and the unrealistic single-actor evaluation scenarios in existing studies.

Method: The authors develop C-SEO Bench, evaluating C-SEO methods for question answering and product recommendation tasks across three domains, with a protocol varying adoption rates among actors.

Result: Most current C-SEO methods are ineffective, while traditional SEO strategies perform better. Gains diminish as more actors adopt C-SEO, indicating a zero-sum problem.

Conclusion: C-SEO Bench highlights the limitations of current C-SEO methods and the need for more robust strategies, with traditional SEO remaining more effective in LLM-driven search.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to differentiate AI agents from LLM chatbots, categorizes evaluation benchmarks, and provides guidance for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks confuse LLM chatbots and AI agents, necessitating a clear distinction to aid researchers in benchmark selection.

Method: The paper analyzes current evaluation approaches, proposes a framework differentiating AI agents by five aspects, and categorizes benchmarks based on environments and capabilities.

Result: A detailed analytical framework and practical reference tables are provided, along with future evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: The findings guide researchers in selecting benchmarks, advancing AI agent evaluation.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL) improves performance of LLMs by treating in-context examples as training targets, closing the gap with dedicated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot in-context fine-tuning lags behind dedicated fine-tuning, and there's a need to address inefficiencies in processing long sequences with many examples.

Method: Proposes ManyICL, extending ICL to a many-shot setting with a novel training objective where every answer in the context is a supervised target.

Result: ManyICL outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning, approaches dedicated fine-tuning performance, and reduces catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ManyICL is a promising approach for improving LLM performance without task-specific fine-tuning, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAM, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism for transformers, improving efficiency and adaptability in long-context NLP tasks without predefined masks or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic complexity in self-attention limits efficiency for long-context tasks, and existing sparse methods fail to capture heterogeneous patterns.

Method: Proposes a dynamic sparse attention mechanism with adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving patterns across layers and heads.

Result: Achieves high alignment with full-attention models, reducing memory and compute overhead while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: DAM offers a scalable, efficient alternative to full attention, enabling practical deployment of large-scale LLMs.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

*Uttej Kallakurik,Edward Humes,Rithvik Jonna,Xiaomin Lin,Tinoosh Mohsenin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel medical assistant system compresses LLMs for edge devices using neuron saliency pruning and quantization, achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are too large for real-time, resource-constrained healthcare environments like edge devices.

Method: Neuron saliency pruning and post-training quantization are used to compress LLMs while preserving performance.

Result: Compressed models (50% Gemma, 67% LLaMA3) achieve real-time inference on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient deployment of LLMs in specialized domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

*Ningyuan Li,Junrui Liu,Yi Shan,Minghui Huang,Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG improves RAG by addressing entity-level extraction limitations with a hierarchical query-resolution strategy and dependency-aware reranking, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods rely heavily on entity extraction, risking misinterpretation and irrelevant retrievals, which degrade response quality.

Method: PankRAG uses a multi-level resolution path for structured reasoning and a dependency-aware reranker to validate retrievals.

Result: PankRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, showing robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: PankRAG enhances RAG by mitigating retrieval issues and improving response fidelity through hierarchical and dependency-aware techniques.

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC extends the CAGSR framework using vLLM runtime for multi-turn dialogue and chain-of-thought reasoning, with attention weight capture and a generalized reward function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-turn dialogue and chain-of-thought reasoning by leveraging attention mechanisms and self-supervised rewards.

Method: Extended CAGSR framework on vLLM runtime, capturing cross-attention weights and generalizing the reward function for conversation histories and reasoning steps.

Result: Implemented attention-based mechanisms with an entropy-based clamping to prevent early context collapse.

Conclusion: Future work includes multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning, with practical trade-offs addressed.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob enhances LLMs for mobility analytics by improving location tokenization and fine-tuning objectives, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic location representation and mobility signal modeling in LLMs.

Method: QT-Mob introduces a location tokenization module and complementary fine-tuning objectives for LLMs.

Result: Superior performance in next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QT-Mob provides a generalizable, effective framework for mobility analytics using LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench evaluates LLMs' consistency in factual evaluation under directional framing, measuring their ability to maintain truth despite user assertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how directional framing of true statements affects LLM agreement, a common user scenario.

Method: Sampling evidence-backed facts from FEVEROUS, constructing opposing framing prompts (user claims correct/incorrect), and recording model agreement and reasoning.

Result: The benchmark isolates framing-induced variability from factual knowledge, aiming to measure LLMs' consistency in truth evaluation.

Conclusion: AssertBench provides a tool to assess LLMs' ability to maintain factual consistency under contradictory user assertions.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, evaluation methods, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for robust LLMs in diverse applications, ensuring correctness and stability in unexpected scenarios.

Method: A thorough review organized by input perturbation types: adversarial robustness, OOD robustness, and evaluation methods.

Result: Comprehensive terminology, representative works, and a curated project for community support.

Conclusion: Highlights future opportunities and research directions, providing a resource for advancing LLM robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of LLMs in automated peer review, highlighting vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and suggesting mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of academic submissions burdens reviewers, and LLMs could assist, but their reliability is questioned due to adversarial attacks.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs' review effectiveness, adversarial attack impact, and proposes mitigation strategies.

Result: LLMs show significant vulnerabilities to text manipulations, compromising review reliability.

Conclusion: Addressing adversarial risks is crucial for AI to enhance, not undermine, scholarly communication integrity.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited—text-based, English-centric, and medicine-focused—so KokushiMD-10 addresses gaps by evaluating broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning.

Method: Constructed from 10 Japanese national healthcare exams, KokushiMD-10 includes 11,588 questions with clinical images and expert rationales. It benchmarks 30+ LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) in text and image settings.

Result: No model consistently passes across all domains, revealing challenges in medical AI despite promising performance.

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10 offers a comprehensive, linguistically grounded resource to advance reasoning-centric medical AI for multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

TL;DR: MATTER is a novel tokenization method for materials science that integrates domain knowledge to prevent fragmentation and semantic loss, outperforming existing methods by 4% in generation and 2% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods from NLP cause excessive fragmentation and semantic loss in materials science, failing to preserve structural and semantic integrity of material concepts.

Method: MATTER combines MatDetector (trained on a materials knowledge base) and a re-ranking method to prioritize material concepts during token merging, ensuring structural and semantic integrity.

Result: MATTER outperforms existing methods, achieving 4% and 2% performance gains in generation and classification tasks, respectively.

Conclusion: Domain knowledge is crucial for effective tokenization in scientific text processing, as demonstrated by MATTER's success.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct is a high-quality instruction dataset designed to improve LLMs' foundational and chat capabilities, outperforming proprietary models like GPT-4 in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source instruction datasets are limited to narrow domains, hindering generalization and widening the gap with proprietary models.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: Phase 1 curates 7.4M foundational instructions; Phase 2 synthesizes 1.5M chat instructions through selection, evolution, and filtering.

Result: Fine-tuned models (e.g., InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B) outperform GPT-4-0314 by 8.6% in instruction following tasks while matching foundational performance.

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct demonstrates the synergy of foundational and chat training, offering insights for holistic LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen is a framework for generating realistic scientific QA & retrieval datasets, addressing the gap between simple existing datasets and complex real-world research needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific QA datasets lack complexity and realism compared to actual research inquiries, limiting their utility for professional researchers.

Method: Developed ScIRGen, a framework using dataset-oriented information extraction, cognitive taxonomy for question generation, and LLM perplexity shift for answer filtering.

Result: Created ScIRGen-Geo, a 61k QA dataset, and benchmarked methods, revealing limitations in handling complex questions.

Conclusion: ScIRGen advances tools for scientific research by better aligning datasets with real-world information needs.

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks foundation models for early ADRD detection using speech and language features, finding ASR-derived embeddings most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is crucial, and speech markers offer non-invasive biomarkers.

Method: Used the PREPARE Challenge dataset with 1,600+ participants, benchmarking speech and language models to classify cognitive status.

Result: Whisper-medium (speech) and BERT with pause annotation (language) performed best. ASR-derived embeddings outperformed others.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based approaches, especially ASR embeddings, show promise for scalable, non-invasive ADRD detection.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for compressing LLMs using self-distillation loss during pruning, focusing on MLP modules to reduce costs without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High deployment costs of LLMs and the inefficiency of gradient-based pruning methods that ignore generative capability.

Method: Introduces self-distillation loss during pruning to leverage original model predictions and focuses on pruning MLP modules for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning methods on zero-shot benchmarks and achieves competitive performance among 1B-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses LLMs with minimal performance degradation, offering a practical solution for deployment.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUTA-LM combines TTA with LM rescoring to address domain mismatches in ASR, achieving robust performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world domain mismatches degrade ASR performance, and existing TTA methods may interfere with LM rescoring.

Method: SUTA-LM extends SUTA with controlled adaptation using acoustic/linguistic info, followed by LM rescoring.

Result: Experiments on 18 datasets show SUTA-LM's robustness across domains.

Conclusion: SUTA-LM effectively integrates TTA and LM rescoring, mitigating domain mismatch issues.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

TL;DR: ASRJam and EchoGuard are introduced as defenses against LLM-powered vishing scams by disrupting ASR with adversarial audio, while maintaining human comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of scalable and convincing vishing scams using LLMs, TTS, and ASR poses a significant security threat, necessitating effective countermeasures.

Method: ASRJam injects adversarial perturbations into audio to disrupt ASR, while EchoGuard uses natural distortions like echo and reverberation for the same purpose. Both are evaluated for effectiveness and usability.

Result: EchoGuard outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in a 39-person study, achieving the best balance between ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Conclusion: EchoGuard is a practical and effective defense against vishing scams, offering superior utility without compromising human communication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech is an end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that uses speech instructions and screenshots for action prediction, addressing limitations of text-based GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based instructions limit accessibility and convenience in hands-free scenarios, prompting the need for speech-based GUI agents.

Method: The system uses a TTS model to generate speech instructions from text, followed by progressive grounding and planning training. A heuristic mixed-instruction strategy mitigates modality imbalance.

Result: Experiments show robust and superior performance, validating speech as an effective instruction modality for GUI agents.

Conclusion: GUIRoboTron-Speech demonstrates significant potential for widespread use of speech in GUI agent interactions.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

### [154] [Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128)
*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models' reasoning errors increasingly mirror human fallacies as they improve, challenging the idea that scaling leads to normative rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they advance.

Method: Applied the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) using PyETR to evaluate 38 models on 383 reasoning tasks.

Result: More advanced models show higher alignment of errors with human fallacies, independent of error rate.

Conclusion: Models converge toward human-like cognition, including biases, rather than normative rationality.

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

TL;DR: CHECK is a continuous-learning framework that reduces hallucinations in LLMs for clinical use, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their clinical application; CHECK aims to address this issue.

Method: CHECK integrates structured clinical databases with an information-theory-based classifier to detect hallucinations.

Result: CHECK reduced hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% and improved USMLE passing rates to 92.1%.

Conclusion: CHECK provides a scalable solution for safe LLM deployment in high-stakes domains like medicine.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-refining framework improves ASR performance using unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels, training a TTS system, and bootstrapping synthetic data into the ASR model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings without relying on labeled datasets.

Method: Uses pseudo-labels from an existing ASR model to train a TTS system, then integrates synthesized speech-text pairs back into the ASR model.

Result: Twister, the adapted model, reduces error rates by 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation, improving ASR performance with unlabeled data.

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergence in complex systems, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess if they exhibit emergent capabilities and intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emergent properties, like intelligence, arise in complex systems such as LLMs, and to evaluate their capabilities.

Method: Review and analyze approaches to quantifying emergence in LLMs, then assess whether these models demonstrate emergent intelligence.

Result: The paper examines evidence of emergent capabilities in LLMs and evaluates their potential for emergent intelligence.

Conclusion: The study contributes to understanding emergence in LLMs, addressing whether they exhibit novel, higher-level properties like intelligence.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for extracting and classifying medication discontinuations in EHR notes, finding GPT-4o and open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct perform well, with few-shot learning improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication discontinuation data in EHRs is often buried in unstructured notes, posing patient safety risks. The study aims to assess LLMs' ability to extract and classify this information without human annotation.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on three EHR datasets, testing medication extraction, status classification, and joint tasks. Explored zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies.

Result: GPT-4o led in zero-shot tasks (94.0% F1 for extraction, 78.1% for classification). Open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct also performed well. Few-shot learning improved performance, while CoT was inconsistent.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for EHR medication tasks, with open-source models offering scalable alternatives. Few-shot learning enhances performance, but medical-specific LLMs lag behind general-domain ones.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small models (<1B parameters) remain competitive in BEA 2025 tasks despite limited computational resources, with performance gaps of 6.46-13.13 points compared to winners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited computational power in Global South research labs by proving smaller models can still compete.

Method: Use models with fewer than 1B parameters, testing their performance in the BEA 2025 shared task.

Result: Performance gaps ranged from 6.46 to 13.13 points across tracks, showing competitiveness.

Conclusion: Small models are viable for tasks, even on low-budget or GPU-less setups.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMSAE debiases multilingual representations by identifying joint bias subspaces across languages, outperforming monolingual and cross-lingual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods fail to leverage shared semantic spaces in multilingual representations, limiting cross-language bias mitigation.

Method: IMSAE uses iterative SVD-based truncation to identify and mitigate joint bias subspaces across multiple languages.

Result: IMSAE effectively debiases across eight languages and five demographic dimensions, even in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: IMSAE outperforms traditional approaches while preserving model utility, demonstrating its potential for multilingual debiasing.

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

*Kushagra Dixit,Abhishek Rajgaria,Harshavardhan Kalalbandi,Dan Roth,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompting techniques for temporal table reasoning in LLMs, finding no single method consistently best. It introduces SEAR, an adaptive framework, which outperforms baselines and shows benefits from table structure refactoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting techniques for temporal table reasoning in LLMs lack exploration of their impact and adaptability across diverse table types, leading to inconsistent performance.

Method: The study investigates multiple prompting techniques, introduces SEAR (an adaptive framework), and evaluates performance across table types, including the impact of table refactoring.

Result: SEAR outperforms baseline methods across all table types, and unified table representation enhances reasoning. No single prompting method is universally optimal.

Conclusion: SEAR's adaptive approach and structured reasoning improve temporal table reasoning, with table refactoring further enhancing performance. Future work could explore broader applications.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

*Liran Ringel,Elad Tolochinsky,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learning a dedicated continue-thinking token improves model accuracy more than fixed tokens in test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if a learned continue-thinking token can outperform fixed tokens in extending reasoning steps for better accuracy.

Method: Augment a distilled DeepSeek-R1 with a learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only its embedding via reinforcement learning while freezing model weights.

Result: The learned token achieves a 4.2% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, outperforming the fixed-token approach (1.3% improvement).

Conclusion: A learned continue-thinking token is more effective than fixed tokens for enhancing reasoning and accuracy in language models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of curriculum learning in pretraining language models is underexplored, prompting the first systematic investigation in this area.

Method: Experiments with vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula guided by six difficulty metrics (linguistic and information-theoretic). Models trained under these settings were evaluated on eight benchmarks.

Result: Curriculum learning improves convergence early/mid-training and provides lasting gains (up to 3.5%) as a warmup strategy. Compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability are effective difficulty signals.

Conclusion: Data ordering is crucial in large-scale pretraining, offering scalable, data-efficient model development insights.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avey, a new neural architecture, replaces Transformers and RNNs by combining a ranker and autoregressive processor to handle long sequences efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with long sequences due to fixed context windows and quadratic attention complexity, while RNNs lack parallelism. Avey aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Avey uses a ranker and autoregressive neural processor to identify and contextualize relevant tokens, decoupling sequence length from context width.

Result: Avey performs well on short-range NLP tasks and excels at capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Avey offers a promising alternative to Transformers and RNNs, addressing their limitations in handling long sequences.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

*Yi-Chien Lin,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models' surprisal predicts human sentence processing difficulty, with higher perplexity models being less predictive. This trend extends from latency-based measures to brain imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if the observed relationship between Transformer model perplexity and surprisal predictive power on reading times generalizes to brain imaging data.

Method: Evaluated surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer models across three language families on two fMRI datasets.

Result: Higher perplexity models were less predictive of neural measures, confirming the trend seen in latency-based measures.

Conclusion: The relationship between model perplexity and surprisal predictive power generalizes to neural measures, not just latency-based ones.

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLM agents for pairwise manuscript comparisons in peer review, showing improved accuracy over traditional methods but revealing biases in novelty and institutional representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink peer review with LLMs beyond replicating traditional workflows, focusing on new paradigms for evaluating manuscript quality.

Method: Introduces a mechanism where LLM agents perform pairwise comparisons of manuscripts, aggregating results for robust quality assessment.

Result: The comparative approach outperforms traditional rating-based methods in identifying high-impact papers but shows biases in novelty and institutional balance.

Conclusion: LLMs offer transformative potential for peer review, but future systems must address equity and diversity challenges.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

TL;DR: A text-based approach for Speaker Diarization (SD) using sentence-level speaker change detection, outperforming audio-based methods in short conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-based SD systems struggle with audio quality and speaker similarity; this paper explores text-based alternatives.

Method: Developed two models: Single Prediction Model (SPM) and Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), using dialogue transcripts.

Result: Text-based SD, especially MPM, competes with audio-based systems, excelling in short conversations.

Conclusion: Text-based SD shows promise, emphasizing semantic understanding and opening paths for multimodal research.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Method: The study prompts models to evaluate moral patient interventions, analyzing biases quantitatively. It compares baseline demographics (white, middle-aged/young males) with others.

Result: Findings show baseline demographics are often white males, but non-baseline groups are more willing to help. The method untangles these biases.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools for objective bias assessment in LLMs, aiding developers in addressing biases in outputs or training.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test

### [170] [Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling for Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11389)
*Karanpartap Singh,Neil Band,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS improves pretraining efficiency by gradually adding layers and increasing data difficulty, outperforming baselines on benchmarks like PIQA and ARC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive development, CGLS aims to enhance learning efficiency in large language model pretraining by synchronizing model growth with data difficulty.

Method: CGLS uses progressive layer stacking and a curriculum transitioning from simpler to more complex data (e.g., synthetic stories to web data, general text to technical content).

Result: At 100M and 1.2B parameter scales, CGLS outperforms baselines on benchmarks (PIQA, ARC) and improves zero-shot performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CGLS effectively leverages progressive stacking to enhance generalization and performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares machine learning models and fine-tuned LLMs for predicting early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC) in patients under 45, achieving 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EoCRC incidence is rising, but current screening guidelines miss younger populations, necessitating better predictive tools.

Method: Applied 10 machine learning models and fine-tuned LLMs using patient data (conditions, lab results, observations) from 1,953 CRC patients across US health systems.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM outperformed with 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for EoCRC prediction, potentially improving early detection in younger populations.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age
established by national guidelines for cancer screening. In this paper, we
applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey
prior to the CRC diagnoses. We retrospectively identified 1,953 CRC patients
from multiple health systems across the United States. The results demonstrated
that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%
specificity.

### [172] [Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference via KV Cache Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11418)
*Jie Hu,Shengnan Wang,Yutong He,Ping Gong,Jiawei Yi,Juncheng Zhang,Youhui Bai,Renhai Chen,Gong Zhang,Cheng Li,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chelsea is a framework for online KV cache clustering in LLMs, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The substantial KV cache in long-context LLMs creates deployment challenges, with existing solutions either discarding critical data or offering limited efficiency.

Method: Chelsea uses Chunked Soft Matching to cluster similar key states, merging KV cache into centroids within chunks.

Result: Achieves up to 80% KV cache reduction, 3.19x faster decoding, and 2.72x lower latency while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Chelsea effectively addresses KV cache inefficiencies in LLMs, offering significant deployment benefits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

### [173] [Agent-RLVR: Training Software Engineering Agents via Guidance and Environment Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11425)
*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR improves RLVR for agentic tasks by adding guidance, boosting performance on software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR struggles in agentic environments due to sparse rewards; Agent-RLVR addresses this by mimicking human pedagogy.

Method: Agent-RLVR uses agent guidance (strategic plans, error feedback) to steer agents, validated by unit tests and updated via RLVR.

Result: Pass@1 performance rose from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified, further to 27.8% with reward model training.

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR enables effective RLVR in complex environments, advancing agent training beyond conventional RL limits.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

TL;DR: KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system using fine-tuned NLLB models, outperformed GPT-4 and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks, offering balanced error correction and a Chrome extension for accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and explore the potential of compact, task-specific models against larger LLMs.

Method: Fine-tuned NLLB models with special language tokens, evaluated using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge" method on social media datasets.

Result: KoGEC outperformed GPT-4 and HCX-3, showing balanced error correction, while larger LLMs neglected punctuation errors. Token vocabulary expansion decreased performance.

Conclusion: KoGEC provides an efficient Korean GEC solution, demonstrating the viability of compact models in specialized NLP tasks, and introduces a new evaluation method.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

*Harvey Yiyun Fu,Aryan Shrivastava,Jared Moore,Peter West,Chenhao Tan,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well at recalling surprising info but struggle to detect omitted info. AbsenceBench tests this gap, revealing poor performance even in state-of-the-art models due to Transformer limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to detect missing information, a critical but overlooked capability.

Method: Introduces AbsenceBench, testing LLMs on detecting removed info in numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score, highlighting a fundamental limitation in Transformer attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: LLMs excel at some tasks (e.g., NIAH) but unexpectedly fail at detecting omissions, revealing a key limitation in their design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

### [176] [A Gamified Evaluation and Recruitment Platform for Low Resource Language Machine Translation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11467)
*Carlos Rafael Catalan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages (LRLs) by proposing a gamified platform to recruit human evaluators and bridge the resource gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated metrics for MT systems in LRLs are inadequate due to their string-based nature, lacking nuance. Human evaluators with language expertise are essential but scarce.

Method: The paper reviews existing evaluation procedures and designs a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for MT system developers.

Result: A platform design is proposed to address the shortage of datasets and evaluators for LRLs. Challenges and broader NLP applications are discussed.

Conclusion: The proposed platform aims to improve MT system evaluation for LRLs by leveraging human expertise and gamification, with potential wider NLP benefits.

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

TL;DR: Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework, improves clinical decision-making by verifying reasoning steps against medical knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to localize and correct errors in clinical reasoning, which is critical for accurate diagnosis and patient care.

Method: Med-PRM uses retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against medical knowledge bases like clinical guidelines and literature.

Result: Med-PRM improves base models by up to 13.50% and achieves over 80% accuracy on MedQA with small-scale models.

Conclusion: Med-PRM effectively enhances reasoning quality in clinical decision-making and demonstrates broad applicability.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

TL;DR: The paper explores the medical conceptual grounding of language models (LMs) in identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts, finding pre-trained LMs outperform large LMs for specific concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the utility of language models in biomedical NLP, particularly their ability to understand medical concepts compared to expert clinicians.

Method: Evaluation of various LMs against expert clinicians for identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts.

Result: Pre-trained LMs outperform large LMs in identifying specific (low-level) medical concepts.

Conclusion: Pre-trained language models show promise for specialized medical NLP tasks, especially for fine-grained concept identification.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained

*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BERT's relational understanding is not innate from pretraining but can be induced via fine-tuning, showing behavioral performance doesn't guarantee structured conceptual competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if BERT's strong performance on semantic tasks reflects true conceptual competence or just surface-level statistical associations.

Method: Examines BERT's internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations, comparing pretrained and fine-tuned models.

Result: Pretrained BERT shows high classification accuracy but only organizes concept pairs by relation type after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Relational schemata in BERT are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be learned through task-specific training, highlighting the gap between behavioral performance and structured understanding.

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

### [180] [Lag-Relative Sparse Attention In Long Context Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11498)
*Manlai Liang,Wanyi Huang,Mandi Liu,Huaijun Li,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) with LagKV compression to improve LLMs' handling of long-context input without added parameters or high overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context input due to computational and memory constraints, and existing compression methods degrade performance or are incompatible with post-training.

Method: Proposes LRSA with LagKV compression, using chunk-by-chunk prefilling to select top K key-value pairs in a lagging window for efficiency.

Result: LRSA enhances LLM robustness with compression and improves fine-tuned performance in question-answer tasks.

Conclusion: LRSA offers an efficient, low-overhead solution for long-context post-training in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

*Seongbo Jang,Seonghyeon Lee,Dongha Lee,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal dialogue systems, proposing methods for response retrieval in text and image modalities, comparing two-step and end-to-end approaches, and highlighting the benefits of parameter sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating multimodal responses (text and image) in dialogue systems, the paper aims to improve retrieval-based systems by integrating multiple modalities effectively.

Method: The study formulates a multimodal dialogue response retrieval task with three subtasks. It proposes three integration methods: two-step and end-to-end approaches, and evaluates their performance.

Result: Experiments show the end-to-end approach performs comparably to the two-step method without intermediate steps. Parameter sharing reduces parameters and improves performance by transferring knowledge across subtasks and modalities.

Conclusion: The end-to-end approach is efficient, and parameter sharing enhances performance, making it a viable strategy for multimodal dialogue systems.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUDI improves personalized dialogue generation by using structured dialogue graphs and a novel graph encoder (DialogueGAT) to capture discourse relations and persona, enhancing response coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing naturalness and coherence in personalized dialogue generation for better human-machine interaction.

Method: Uses a Large Language Model to annotate discourse relations, creates structured dialogue graphs, and employs DialogueGAT for encoding. Coherence-aware attention strategies are used during response generation.

Result: Significant improvements in personalized response quality, making dialogues more human-like.

Conclusion: MUDI effectively addresses coherence and personalization in dialogue generation, improving interaction quality.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform specialized models in Arabic and Yoruba text diacritization, but smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for diacritization in Arabic and Yoruba, addressing ambiguities and comparing them to specialized models.

Method: Introduce MultiDiac dataset, evaluate 14 LLMs and 6 specialized models, fine-tune 4 small models with LoRA for Yoruba.

Result: LLMs outperform specialized models; smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning enhances performance and reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for diacritization, but fine-tuning is beneficial for smaller models to mitigate issues.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

*Simeon Junker,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneGram, a dataset for studying how scene context influences human conceptualization of objects, and compares it to multimodal LLMs, which lack human-like variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scene context affects human conceptualization of objects and to evaluate how well multimodal LLMs capture this variability.

Method: Created SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes in various scenes, and analyzed references from multimodal LLMs.

Result: Multimodal LLMs do not replicate the richness and variability of human conceptualizations.

Conclusion: Scene context significantly shapes human conceptualization, and current LLMs fall short in capturing this complexity.

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-Gen framework uses a cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models, improving efficiency and accuracy without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in effectiveness and efficiency of scaling language models for domain-specific tasks, especially for small edge-side models.

Method: Utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models via reparameterization, reducing input context length.

Result: Outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, achieving competitive accuracy, 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B, and 10.1x compression with Gemma-2B.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen enables efficient knowledge transfer and specialization for edge-side models, enhancing performance in domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

*Pietro Ferrazzi,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity of annotated CRF datasets by converting existing datasets into structured CRFs, demonstrating the challenge of CRF slot filling even for advanced LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available, well-annotated CRF datasets are rare, hindering the development of CRF slot filling systems from clinical notes.

Method: A semi-automatic conversion methodology was applied to the E3C dataset in English and Italian to create a structured CRF dataset.

Result: Slot filling achieved 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English in zero-shot LLMs, with poorer results for open-source models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty of CRF slot filling and releases a new dataset to aid future research.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing assesses model behavior by removing specific linguistic info. INLP introduces random changes, while MP and LEACE offer more targeted removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of removing target linguistic info in models for better behavioral analysis.

Method: Compare INLP with Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE for targeted info removal in Amnesic Probing.

Result: MP and LEACE remove info more precisely than INLP, enhancing behavioral explanations.

Conclusion: MP and LEACE are superior alternatives to INLP for targeted info removal in Amnesic Probing.

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach using LLMs and multi-agent architectures simplifies complex sentences effectively, achieving 70% success vs. 48% for single-agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex sentences while preserving semantic and logical integrity, especially for video game design.

Method: Combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures.

Result: 70% success rate in simplifying complex sentences, outperforming the single-agent approach (48%).

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is more effective for sentence simplification in video game design applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into
sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and
logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid
approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to
enhance the sentence simplification process. Experimental results show that our
approach was able to successfully simplify 70% of the complex sentences written
for video game design application. In comparison, a single-agent approach
attained a 48% success rate on the same task.

*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a framework for dynamic AI behavior adjustment based on human-interpretable directives, overcoming static preference limitations in models like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models assume static preferences, limiting adaptability. CPT aims to enable dynamic behavior adjustment for nuanced, context-dependent feedback.

Method: CPT uses synthetically generated preference data conditioned on system prompts from fine-grained rubrics, fine-tuning LLMs to adjust outputs without retraining.

Result: CPT provides fine-grained control and models nuanced human feedback, with experimental artifacts released.

Conclusion: CPT offers a flexible, interpretable solution for dynamic AI alignment, enhancing adaptability and control.

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting general matrix-matrix multiplication (gemm) to mixed-precision integer arithmetic for modern ISAs, showing performance gains over floating-point implementations in DL workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward reduced-precision formats in DL for efficiency necessitates revisiting traditional gemm methods to align with modern hardware capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces novel micro-kernel designs and data layouts optimized for mixed-precision integer arithmetic across x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Result: Demonstrated significant performance improvements using mixed-precision integer arithmetic over floating-point implementations on three CPU architectures.

Conclusion: The work marks a new era in gemm optimization, driven by DL inference demands, termed the 'Cambrian period' for matrix multiplication.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART replaces autoregressive Chain-of-Thought reasoning with non-autoregressive Silent Thought, improving efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive CoT reasoning in LLMs causes computational overhead, limiting use in latency-sensitive applications.

Method: DART uses self-distillation with two pathways: CoT for traditional reasoning and ST for direct answer generation via evolving tokens.

Result: DART matches baseline reasoning performance with significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: DART is a viable, efficient alternative to autoregressive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

*Mingxuan Du,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs), featuring 100 PhD-level tasks across 22 fields. It proposes two novel evaluation methods aligned with human judgment and open-sources the benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLM-based Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which autonomously conduct web research and generate reports.

Method: The authors present DeepResearch Bench with 100 expert-crafted tasks and propose two evaluation methodologies: a reference-based method for report quality and a framework for assessing retrieval and citation accuracy.

Result: The benchmark and evaluation methods aim to standardize DRA assessment, with open-sourced resources to foster development.

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench fills a critical gap in DRA evaluation, offering tools to accelerate progress in LLM-based agent research.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses length generalization in LLMs by focusing on output distribution alignment across varying sequence lengths, proposing a metric and regularization method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fixed context window in transformers limits LLMs' effectiveness for long-context modeling, with length generalization being a key challenge.

Method: The study shifts focus to output distribution alignment, introduces a metric (Long-Short Misalignment), and develops a regularization term to promote alignment during training.

Result: Experiments show a strong correlation between the proposed metric and length generalization performance, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The work provides insights for better long-context modeling in LLMs, with practical improvements demonstrated through the proposed method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using zero-shot persona prompting in LLMs to predict individual voting decisions and group policy positions in the European Parliament, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.793.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit progressive left-leaning biases, and persona prompts can align them with other socioeconomic groups. This work investigates if such prompts can predict voting behavior and policy positions accurately.

Method: Zero-shot persona prompting with limited information is used to predict voting decisions and group policy positions. Stability is tested against counterfactual arguments, different prompts, and generation methods.

Result: The method achieves a weighted F1 score of ~0.793 in simulating European Parliament voting behavior.

Conclusion: Persona prompting can reasonably predict voting behavior and policy positions, with potential applications in political analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) ability to resolve references in simple visual tasks, revealing challenges in pragmatic capabilities like context-dependent color interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' pragmatic abilities using straightforward visual reference tasks, which are easy for humans but reveal model limitations.

Method: Evaluated MLLMs on reference resolution tasks with abstract visual stimuli (e.g., color patches, grids).

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic pragmatic capabilities, such as context-dependent color interpretation.

Conclusion: Simple visual reference tasks highlight significant gaps in MLLMs' pragmatic understanding, despite their advanced linguistic abilities.

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPA is a two-stage framework for multi-session dialogue generation that first generates a general response, then aligns it with persona information, improving consistency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods retrieve persona information before response generation, limiting diversity and producing generic outputs. PPA addresses this by reversing the process.

Method: PPA generates a general response from dialogue context, retrieves relevant persona memories using the response as a query, and refines the response to align with the persona.

Result: PPA outperforms prior methods in consistency, diversity, and persona relevance on multi-session dialogue data.

Conclusion: PPA offers a flexible and effective paradigm for long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

TL;DR: FourierAttention reduces memory demands in large language models by exploiting heterogeneous head dimensions and using Fourier bases for compression, achieving high accuracy without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of existing KV cache compression methods, which often homogenize head dimensions or prune tokens, leading to accuracy loss or computational overhead.

Method: Projects long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, approximating their temporal evolution with spectral coefficients. Includes a custom Triton kernel (FlashFourierAttention) for optimized memory usage.

Result: Achieves top long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) benchmarks with efficient memory usage.

Conclusion: FourierAttention offers a training-free, accurate, and efficient solution for KV cache compression in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Motivation: To enhance German language processing by leveraging updated architectures and tailored datasets.

Method: Pre-trained using fairseq, initialized from GottBERT, and trained with Whole Word Masking. Extended-input variants were derived using Nyströmformer and Longformer.

Result: GeistBERT outperformed base models and set new SOTA in tasks like NER and text classification.

Conclusion: GeistBERT is released under MIT license to support the German NLP community.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of defining criteria to assess the effectiveness of counter-speech in mitigating online hate speech.

Method: Proposed a framework with six dimensions (Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, Fairness), annotated 4,214 CS instances, and introduced multi-task and dependency-based classification strategies.

Result: Achieved strong classification results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1) on expert- and user-written CS, outperforming baselines and showing dimension interdependence.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust method for evaluating counter-speech effectiveness, with potential for community use and further research.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to fully integrate near-perfect feedback, termed FEEDBACK FRICTION, even under ideal conditions, with limited improvement from mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how effectively LLMs incorporate extrinsic feedback and identify limitations in their ability to self-improve.

Method: Controlled experiments with solver models receiving targeted feedback from a generator with ground-truth access, tested across diverse tasks and state-of-the-art models.

Result: Models resist feedback (FEEDBACK FRICTION), with sampling-based strategies improving but not solving the issue. Overconfidence and data familiarity were ruled out as causes.

Conclusion: Highlighting FEEDBACK FRICTION in LLMs and ruling out common causes can guide future research in self-improvement.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A defense framework using contrastive representation learning (CRL) to improve LLM robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses lack generalization across attack types.

Method: Finetunes models with triplet-based loss and adversarial hard negative mining to separate benign and harmful representations.

Result: Outperforms prior defenses, improving robustness against input-level and embedding-space attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL-based framework effectively enhances LLM defense against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior

*Yuliang Xu,Siming Huang,Mingmeng Geng,Yao Wan,Xuanhua Shi,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs influence code style, analyzing trends in naming conventions, complexity, and maintainability across GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of LLMs on coding practices, particularly in style evolution.

Method: Analysis of code from 19,000+ GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers (2020-2025), focusing on naming, complexity, and similarity.

Result: Identified trends like increased snake_case usage (47% to 51% in Python) and LLM-influenced style changes.

Conclusion: LLMs measurably affect real-world programming style, though precise estimation of their impact remains challenging.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

### [203] [Developing a Dyslexia Indicator Using Eye Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11004)
*Kevin Cogan,Vuong M. Ngo,Mark Roantree*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using eye-tracking and machine learning for early dyslexia detection, achieving 88.58% accuracy with a Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering for severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia affects 10-20% of people, impairing learning. Current diagnostic methods may lack accessibility, prompting the need for innovative, cost-effective solutions.

Method: Eye-tracking technology analyzes eye movement patterns (e.g., prolonged fixation, erratic saccades). A Random Forest Classifier detects dyslexia, and hierarchical clustering assesses severity.

Result: The method achieved 88.58% accuracy in detecting dyslexia and identified varying severity levels through clustering.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking combined with machine learning offers a non-invasive, accurate, and accessible diagnostic tool for dyslexia, including borderline cases.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

### [204] [Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11010)
*Emilio Porcu,Roy El Moukari,Laurent Najman,Francisco Herrera,Horst Simon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'essential data science' as an ecosystem addressing 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, ethics) across the data life cycle. It highlights the role of data agents and the abstract entity of data scientists, proposing 'pan-data science' to integrate disciplines. It warns of divergence between computational and foundational data science without measures to assess the usefulness of discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a holistic view of data science as an ecosystem, addressing challenges from the data universe and integrating discipline-specific approaches.

Method: The paper defines essential data science, data agents, and data scientists, and introduces pan-data science to unify disciplines. It semantically splits data science into computational and foundational aspects.

Result: Identifies a potential divergence between computational and foundational data science without usefulness metrics for discoveries.

Conclusion: Suggests rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data discoveries to mitigate divergence and strengthen the data science ecosystem.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

*Minhyuk Seo,Taeheon Kim,Hankook Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy and cost issues in centralized foundation models by proposing personalized federated learning (PFL) solutions for data and model heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training of foundation models raises privacy concerns and high transmission costs, while existing PFL studies overlook real-world data and model heterogeneity.

Method: The authors introduce a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method for data heterogeneity and a dimension-invariant module for model heterogeneity.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalization and generalization, validated on a multi-modal PFL benchmark with 40 tasks.

Conclusion: The study successfully tackles real-world challenges in PFL, offering effective solutions for data and model heterogeneity.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper explores how synthetic faces and gender classification algorithms exhibit algorithmic lookism, favoring attractive faces and showing biases, especially against non-White women.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fairness issues in digital identity systems due to appearance-based biases in AI models.

Method: Experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, analyzing text-to-image systems and gender classification models.

Result: T2I systems link attractiveness to unrelated positive traits, and gender models have higher errors for less-attractive faces, particularly non-White women.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fairness concerns in AI-driven digital identity systems due to appearance biases.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns with real electricity consumption data by identifying effective synthetic alternatives for dToU tariff adoption.

Method: Comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods (WGAN, CTGAN, Diffusion Models, Gaussian noise) under different regimes, assessing utility, distribution fidelity, and privacy leakage.

Result: Diffusion Models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while CTGAN provides the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: Structured generative models like Diffusion Models and CTGAN are promising for privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

*Federico Pennino,Bianca Raimondi,Massimo Rondelli,Andrea Gurioli,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Qwen 2.5 and GRPO to improve code generation for languages with limited training data, demonstrated with Prolog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating accurate code for less popular languages with scarce training data.

Method: Combines Qwen 2.5 with GRPO, integrating reasoning-driven feedback into reinforcement learning.

Result: Improved reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness in Prolog code generation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for enhancing code generation in languages with limited resources.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the role of mobility data and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in predicting disease outbreaks, finding that while mobility data and GCNs don't significantly improve forecasts, mortality and hospitalization data do. Spatial maps from GCNs correlate with lockdown orders, suggesting their utility as mobility indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning algorithms and epidemiological applications, addressing the underperformance of benchmark methods with real-world data due to mobility integration challenges.

Method: A two-phase approach: pilot study to assess mobility data significance, followed by evaluating GCNs on a transformer backbone.

Result: Mobility data and GCNs don't significantly enhance forecasting, but mortality and hospitalization data improve accuracy. GCN-derived spatial maps correlate with lockdown orders.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel perspective on mobility representation in disease prediction, aiding decision-makers in outbreak preparedness.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

TL;DR: YingLong is a joint forecasting framework using a non-causal, bidirectional transformer for time series prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a novel scaling effect and multi-input ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time series prediction by introducing a non-causal, bidirectional approach that outperforms traditional methods and leverages delayed chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Uses a masked token recovery-trained encoder-only transformer (YingLong) with multi-input ensemble to reduce output variance.

Result: Achieves 60% best performance in zero-shot tasks on ETT and Weather datasets and outperforms other models by 14-44% on GIFT-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: YingLong demonstrates superior accuracy and generalizability, with pretrained models available for use.

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

*Nazmus Saadat As-Saquib,A N M Nafiz Abeer,Hung-Ta Chien,Byung-Jun Yoon,Suhas Kumar,Su-in Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forward Target Propagation (FTP) is proposed as a biologically plausible and efficient alternative to backpropagation (BP), achieving competitive accuracy while addressing BP's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP's limitations in biological plausibility and hardware efficiency motivate the search for alternatives like FTP.

Method: FTP replaces BP's backward pass with a second forward pass, using feedforward computations for layerwise targets, avoiding symmetric weights or inverse functions.

Result: FTP matches BP's accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, excels in sequential tasks, and outperforms BP in low-precision and hardware-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: FTP is a promising, efficient solution for on-device and neuromorphic learning due to its forward-only nature and hardware compatibility.

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces zero-shot-s², a task-aligned prompting method for detecting AI-generated images using pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), improving performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of supervised detection methods for AI-generated images, which struggle with generalization across diverse generators.

Method: Utilizes pre-trained VLMs with task-aligned prompting (zero-shot-s²) to enhance detection performance, avoiding the need for large datasets or fine-tuning.

Result: Zero-shot-s² boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% across diverse datasets and models, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Task-aligned prompting enhances VLMs' latent capabilities for AI-generated image detection, offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to evaluate accelerometer and

fusion and encourages data scientists to collect more multi-sensor data,

*Minjae Kwon,Tyler Ingebrand,Ufuk Topcu,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning ensures safety by adapting to hidden parameters and forecasting risks, with proven probabilistic guarantees and minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden parameters like mass distribution or friction can cause safety risks during robot execution, necessitating adaptive safety measures.

Method: Uses constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes, function encoders for real-time inference, and conformal prediction for uncertainty.

Result: Significantly reduces safety violations, achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, and incurs minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism ensures probabilistic safety guarantees and optimal policies among safety-compliant ones.

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalVLBench, a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on visual causal reasoning tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of LVLMs in tasks like recognition and VQA, their performance in visual causal reasoning remains underexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors propose CausalVLBench, a benchmark with three tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction, evaluated on three datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art LVLMs are assessed, revealing their fundamental strengths and weaknesses in visual causal reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark identifies limitations in current LVLMs and encourages new approaches to enhance their visual causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable version of Tversky's similarity model for deep learning, replacing geometric similarity with feature-based similarity, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The geometric similarity model in deep learning lacks psychological plausibility, unlike Tversky's feature-based model, which better aligns with human perception.

Method: A differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity is developed, including neural network components like the Tversky projection layer, which replaces linear projection layers.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements: 24.7% accuracy boost in image classification and 7.5% perplexity reduction in language modeling, with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The work provides a psychologically plausible and interpretable alternative to geometric similarity in deep learning, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

*Yang Qin,Chao Chen,Zhihang Fu,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Peng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Interactive Cross-modal Learning (ICL) framework with a Test-time Human-centered Interaction (THI) module and Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) to improve text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) by refining queries and enhancing data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TIReID methods struggle with challenging candidate images due to network architecture and data quality limitations.

Method: ICL uses human-centered interaction (THI) to refine queries via a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and RDA to enhance text quality through enrichment and reorganization.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements on four TIReID benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICL effectively addresses TIReID challenges by integrating human interaction and data augmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on

*Aochuan Chen,Yifan Niu,Ziqi Gao,Yujie Sun,Shoujun Liu,Gong Chen,Yang Liu,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRePO-LTV, a framework combining graph representation learning and Pareto-optimization to improve LTV prediction in sparse data and correlated task scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LTV prediction is crucial for advertisers but is hindered by sparse data and interdependent tasks.

Method: Uses graph representation learning for data scarcity and Pareto-optimization for task interdependence.

Result: Proposes GRePO-LTV to enhance LTV prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in LTV prediction.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

*Linjie Li,Zhenyu Wu,Yang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoTE, a framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) that addresses issues like prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment by leveraging task-specific experts and sparse activation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIL requires models to learn continuously without forgetting past knowledge. Existing methods like prompt-based or adapter-based approaches face challenges like overwriting or dimensional inconsistency.

Method: The MoTE framework uses task-specific experts, task-aware filtering, and joint inference to avoid catastrophic forgetting and dimensional misalignment. It also explores adapter expansion trade-offs.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoTE's superiority without needing exemplar sets, with task scalability linear to adapter count.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively mitigates CIL challenges, offering a scalable solution with Adapter-Limited MoTE for performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

*Cheng Jin,Zhenyu Xiao,Chutao Liu,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) improves text-to-image synthesis but causes color distortions at high guidance weights. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) mitigates these distortions while maintaining text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the color distortions in CFG under high guidance weights, which degrade image quality despite improved text-image alignment.

Method: Introduce Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) to constrain magnitude variations and optimize angular alignment in the latent space.

Result: ADG outperforms existing methods, improving color fidelity and human perceptual alignment while preserving text-image alignment.

Conclusion: ADG effectively resolves CFG-induced distortions, enhancing image quality and perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention

paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

TL;DR: ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network, outperforms GNNs in modeling multi-reactant reactions by using hyperedges and innovative sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with multi-reactant interactions in reaction virtual screening, necessitating a more expressive framework.

Method: ChemHGNN employs hyperedges for multi-reactant modeling, RCNS for negative sampling, and hierarchical embeddings for molecule, reaction, and hypergraph features.

Result: ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines on the USPTO dataset, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: HGNNs, like ChemHGNN, are superior to GNNs for reaction virtual screening, offering a chemically informed and interpretable approach.

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

*Baoquan Zhang,Guangning Xu,Michael. K. Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFT is a novel PEFT method that leverages pretrained weights to guide task-specific updates, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid inefficient training of task-specific updates from scratch by utilizing well-pretrained weights.

Method: Applies row and column transformations to distill structured information from pretrained weights and decomposes updates into shared and specific components.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods on CV and NLP benchmarks like VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE.

Conclusion: GenFT offers a resource-efficient and high-performing approach for model adaptation.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

*Jiaqi Zhao,Miao Zhang,Weili Guan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces null space projection (Q2N) to reduce quantization error in LLMs, showing improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for LLMs yield diminishing returns, prompting the need for innovative approaches like null space optimization.

Method: Proposes Q2N, a plug-in null space projection module, with an efficient approximation method and closed-form solution for practical inference.

Result: Q2N outperforms baselines on models like LLaMA3, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, validating null space optimization.

Conclusion: This work pioneers null space insights for quantization, encouraging future research in advanced compression methods.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-use training data methods are non-interactive and non-compositional, limiting online RL training.

Method: Procedural generation of interactive tools and compositional tool-use data via the RandomWorld pipeline.

Result: Models trained on RandomWorld data achieve SoTA on NESTFUL benchmarks and scale with data volume.

Conclusion: RandomWorld enables further improvements in tool-use performance using synthetic data.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how different data augmentation methods impact confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations of current techniques.

Method: Study various data augmentation strategies, analyzing their effects on confidence estimation, semantic preservation, and application ranges.

Result: Greater data diversity improves augmentation effectiveness, and random combinations of augmentations perform well across applications.

Conclusion: Data augmentation enhances confidence estimation, with random augmentation combinations being a practical and effective choice.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

*Chirudeep Tupakula,Rittika Shamsuddin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A perception-driven framework for bias detection in machine learning uses crowdsourced human judgment to identify disparities, validated by statistical tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bias detection methods rely on sensitive labels or rigid metrics, limiting real-world applicability. This paper aims to provide a scalable, label-efficient alternative.

Method: A lightweight web platform collects binary judgments on group similarity from non-experts via visualizations, aggregating feedback to flag biased data segments.

Result: Perceptual signals from users reliably correlate with known bias cases, showing visual intuition can serve as a fairness auditing proxy.

Conclusion: The framework offers an interpretable, human-aligned alternative to conventional fairness diagnostics, enabling scalable bias detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMuSeNet, a complex-valued neural network, improves spectrum sensing accuracy and training efficiency in low-SNR environments compared to traditional real-valued networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of real-valued neural networks in capturing wireless signal properties like phase and amplitude in low-SNR environments.

Method: Introduces CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal segmentation network with residual architecture, CFL loss, and CIoU metric.

Result: Achieves 98.98%-99.90% accuracy, 9.2% improvement over real-valued networks, and reduces training time by 92.2%.

Conclusion: Complex-valued architectures like CMuSeNet enhance weak signal detection and training efficiency for spectrum sensing.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) pose an escalating security concerns as the
market for consumer and military UAVs grows. This paper address the critical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSW-EPNews, a benchmark for electricity price forecasting using multimodal inputs (time-series data and textual news). It evaluates traditional models and LLMs, finding marginal gains from news features for classical models and modest improvements for LLMs, though with frequent hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing electricity price forecasting methods ignore textual signals, limiting accuracy. The study aims to bridge this gap by integrating news and weather data with numerical histories.

Method: The benchmark uses NSW-EPNews, a dataset with 175k half-hourly prices, temperature readings, and news summaries. It evaluates 48-step-ahead forecasting with multimodal inputs (lagged prices, vectorized news, weather) for classical models and prompt-engineered contexts for LLMs.

Result: Classical models show marginal benefits from news features. LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro show modest improvements but suffer from hallucinations (fabricated/malformed outputs).

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews highlights the gap between LLM capabilities and high-stakes forecasting needs, providing a testbed for grounded numerical reasoning in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Motivation: To explore and enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities for NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks.

Method: Introduces ACCORD with autoregressive constraint-satisfying generation, dynamic attention, and problem-specific LoRA modules, tested on the ACCORD-90k dataset.

Result: ACCORD consistently outperforms standard methods and larger LLMs, improving solution feasibility.

Conclusion: ACCORD is the first large-scale, end-to-end framework for applying LLMs to diverse combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning

(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bootstrapping Your Behavior (BYB), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that automates behavior vocabulary selection, improving model generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual behavior vocabulary selection in UBS pretraining is labor-intensive, biased, and limits model generalization.

Method: BYB predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding using a student-teacher encoder scheme, eliminating manual vocabulary selection.

Result: BYB improves AUC by 3.9%, training throughput by 98.9%, and shows meaningful attention patterns. Online deployment reduces bad debt risk significantly.

Conclusion: BYB is a scalable and effective UBS pretraining method, outperforming baselines in both offline and online industrial applications.

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Conclusion: The framework effectively adapts MLaaS compositions to dynamic IoT constraints.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in

system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

*Michael Buzzy,Andreas Robertson,Peng Chen,Surya Kalidindi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach addresses the challenge of hyper-sparse data in materials science by using physics-driven data augmentation and local generative models, resulting in the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets for many structural and functional materials hinders progress in materials science. This work aims to overcome this limitation for hyper-sparse, complex spatial data.

Method: The approach involves a physics-driven data augmentation scheme using an ensemble of local generative models trained on minimal experimental data, coordinated through a diversity curation strategy.

Result: The framework creates PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials, and demonstrates its utility by solving long-standing challenges in 3D experimental microscopy.

Conclusion: The work provides an open-source model and dataset, advancing materials science by enabling learning from sparse data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

*Sean Memery,Kevin Denamganai,Anna Kapron-King,Kartic Subr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to make iterative optimization in inverse problems interpretable by using natural language explanations from optimizer traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are crucial in fields like healthcare and climate science, but their iterative optimization processes are often opaque to domain experts.

Method: Instrument a differentiable simulator to emit natural language events during forward and backward passes, then use a Language Model to generate explanations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with an optimization problem and neural network training example.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances interpretability of inverse problem optimization for domain experts.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

*Xijun Li,Jiexiang Yang,Jinghao Wang,Bo Peng,Jianguo Yao,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRCMP is a structure-aware LLM framework for combinatorial optimization, integrating GNNs and LLMs to improve solution quality and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for combinatorial optimization often ignore structural priors, leading to suboptimal solutions and inefficiency.

Method: Combines GNNs for structural embeddings with LLMs to generate solver-specific codes, followed by evolutionary refinement.

Result: Outperforms five neural and LLM-based methods in solution optimality and computational efficiency across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: STRCMP effectively leverages structural priors for better algorithm discovery in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

*Boya Xiong,Shuo Wang,Weifeng Ge,Guanhua Chen,Yun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAMIX is an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework for LLMs, outperforming baselines by optimizing bit allocation to minimize quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing delta-compression methods for LLMs either perform poorly at high compression ratios or rely on empirical bit allocation, lacking theoretical grounding.

Method: ADAMIX uses a mathematical derivation of quantization error to formulate an optimal mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as a 0/1 integer linear programming problem.

Result: ADAMIX outperforms Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% on AIME2024 and GQA tasks with 7B models, achieving better performance at high compression ratios.

Conclusion: ADAMIX provides a theoretically grounded, effective solution for delta-compression in LLMs, significantly improving performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

*Dongyoung Kim,Jinsung Yoon,Jinwoo Shin,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFP (Preference Feature Preservation) is a new framework to mitigate bias in LLM responses by preserving human preference feature distributions during online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning frameworks oversimplify human preferences, leading to biased LLM responses, especially in iterative online learning.

Method: PFP extracts preference features from offline data, trains a classifier, maps features for new inputs, and integrates them into LLM training via system prompts.

Result: PFP reduces bias in preference features and outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: PFP effectively preserves human preference diversity, improving LLM alignment and mitigating bias in online learning.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SectorE is a novel embedding model using polar coordinates to capture semantic hierarchies in knowledge graphs, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing region-based embedding models often ignore semantic hierarchies in entities, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge graph completion.

Method: SectorE embeds entities as points and relations as annular sectors in polar coordinates, combining modulus and phase to model hierarchies and relation attributes.

Result: SectorE achieves competitive performance on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 datasets, excelling in semantic modeling.

Conclusion: SectorE effectively addresses the semantic hierarchy issue in knowledge graph completion, demonstrating superior modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

*Tianle Wang,Jorge Ramirez,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Thomas Proffen,Shantenu Jha,Sudip K. Seal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel batch-mode active learning policy reduces training data by 75% and improves accuracy for neutron diffractometry structure determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron diffractometry structure determination is computationally expensive, and machine learning models can speed it up but require large simulated datasets.

Method: Introduces a batch-mode active learning policy using uncertainty sampling to prioritize uncertain examples, reducing training data needs.

Result: Achieves 75% less training data with improved accuracy and 20% shorter training time without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The active learning policy and streaming workflow significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in neutron diffractometry.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptTSS is a novel framework for multi-granularity time series segmentation, addressing challenges of unified modeling and adaptability, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-granularity states and dynamic pattern adaptation in time series data.

Method: PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism leveraging label and boundary information for segmentation.

Result: Improves accuracy by 24.49% (multi-granularity), 17.88% (single-granularity), and up to 599.24% in transfer learning.

Conclusion: PromptTSS effectively handles hierarchical states and evolving dynamics, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify data-policy coverage in offline RL, proposes a poisoning attack (CSDPC) targeting rare decision patterns, and demonstrates its severe impact on agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL studies overlook security risks from insufficient data-policy coverage and lack multi-step analysis.

Method: Proposes the CSDPC poisoning attack by identifying and poisoning rare decision patterns to reduce coverage.

Result: Poisoning 1% of the dataset degrades agent performance by 90%.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for analyzing and safeguarding offline RL security against coverage-based attacks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses supervised machine learning (decision trees, k-NN, Naive Bayes) to detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges in oil and gas production, focusing on hydrate formation. Decision trees achieved 99.99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil and gas extraction faces challenges like blockages and hydrate formation, impacting efficiency. Machine learning offers a solution to predict and mitigate these issues.

Method: Employed decision trees, k-NN, and Naive Bayes on a cleaned dataset from Petrobras' GitHub. Used scikit-learn for classification.

Result: Decision trees outperformed with 99.99% accuracy in predicting hydrate formation.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively optimizes production efficiency by preventing hydrate-related disruptions.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 97.8%-99.1%, with 99.1% on wearable single-lead ECG data.

Conclusion: uPVC-Net generalizes well across diverse leads and populations, making it suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

*Jacob Lear,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems, focusing on reinforcement learning, and introduces a causal decomposition of fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in studying long-term fairness in dynamic systems while ensuring instantaneous fairness, moving beyond static bias in training data.

Method: A general framework in reinforcement learning measuring long-term fairness via qualification gain differences, decomposed causally into direct, delayed, and spurious effects.

Result: Identifies connections between decomposed fairness components and benefit fairness, proposing a method to balance fairness notions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances fairness requirements, offering insights into long-term fairness in dynamic systems.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs show limited generalizability in BEM tasks, performing slightly better than statistical models in univariate forecasting but struggling with covariates and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability challenges in BEM by evaluating the potential of TSFMs, inspired by LLMs, to generalize across tasks and contexts.

Method: Evaluated TSFMs across four dimensions: zero-shot univariate forecasting, forecasting with covariates, zero-shot representation learning, and robustness to metrics/conditions.

Result: TSFMs perform marginally better than statistical models in univariate forecasting but fail with covariates and complex environments. They excel in zero-shot representation learning.

Conclusion: Targeted advancements in TSFM design, especially for covariates and temporal dynamics, are needed for scalable BEM solutions.

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

TL;DR: A guided diffusion model synthesizes high-fidelity, domain-specific synthetic data, addressing privacy and legal concerns in fields like power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy, security, and legal concerns drive the need for synthetic data, especially in domains like healthcare, finance, and energy.

Method: A guided diffusion model integrates domain-specific constraints (e.g., Kirchhoff laws) via gradient-based guidance to generate statistically representative data.

Result: The model successfully synthesizes high-fidelity power flow datasets, adhering to domain constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses privacy and legal barriers while maintaining data utility, with potential for broader tabular data applications.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: MOODS introduces a multi-objective optimization framework for imbalanced data sampling and a new metric to evaluate sampling methods, improving F1 scores by 1-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor minority class classification in imbalanced datasets by considering diversity between classes, which traditional methods overlook.

Method: Proposes MOODS, a multi-objective bilevel optimization framework for synthetic oversampling and majority undersampling, and introduces the ε/δ non-overlapping diversification metric.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance with F1 score improvements of 1-15%.

Conclusion: MOODS effectively improves classification by balancing diversity and performance, validated by the new metric.

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

TL;DR: ASNO is a novel SciML model combining attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal interactions, improving interpretability and generalization to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning evolving physical processes and adapting to unknown environmental conditions in SciML, where traditional models lack interpretability and generalization.

Method: Proposes ASNO, integrating separable attention for spatial/temporal interactions and BDF-inspired transformers for temporal prediction, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical states and external forces.

Result: ASNO outperforms existing models on SciML benchmarks, showing promise for engineering, physics discovery, and interpretable ML.

Conclusion: ASNO advances SciML by balancing interpretability, generalization, and performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula

### [250] [The Sample Complexity of Parameter-Free Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11336)
*Jared Lawrence,Ari Kalinsky,Hannah Bradfield,Yair Carmon,Oliver Hinder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores stochastic convex optimization with unknown parameters, proposing two methods: a reliable model selection technique to avoid overfitting and a regularization-based approach for adapting to unknown optimality distance. Experiments on few-shot learning validate the model selection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unknown problem parameters in stochastic convex optimization, which complicates tuning and optimization.

Method: 1. A reliable model selection method to avoid overfitting validation sets and tune learning rates. 2. A regularization-based method for adapting to unknown optimality distance.

Result: The methods achieve near-optimal sample complexity and demonstrate adaptability to unknown parameters, validated by experiments on few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Combining the two methods enables simultaneous adaptation to multiple problem structures, improving optimization performance.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

### [251] [Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation via Evidential Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11347)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Evidential Alignment, a framework using uncertainty quantification to mitigate spurious correlations in deep neural networks without needing group annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations, harming generalization and robustness. Existing methods require costly annotations or deterministic models, which may not capture all biases.

Method: Evidential Alignment uses second-order risk minimization and evidential calibration to identify and suppress spurious correlations while preserving core features.

Result: The method improves group robustness across architectures and data modalities, validated theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment offers a scalable, principled solution to spurious correlations without needing annotations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

### [252] [Generalization Bound of Gradient Flow through Training Trajectory and Data-dependent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11357)
*Yilan Chen,Zhichao Wang,Wei Huang,Andi Han,Taiji Suzuki,Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization bound for gradient flow using the loss path kernel (LPK), which captures the training trajectory and provides tighter guarantees than static kernels like NTK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical generalization properties of gradient-based optimization methods, which are empirically successful but theoretically underexplored.

Method: The authors use the LPK, a data-dependent kernel, and combine stability analysis of gradient flow with Rademacher complexity for uniform convergence.

Result: The bound aligns with classical Rademacher complexity bounds, highlights the role of training loss gradients, and shows neural networks' feature learning capability.

Conclusion: The LPK-based bound offers tighter generalization guarantees and is validated by experiments, bridging theory and practice for gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

### [253] [EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11368)
*Pintu Kumar,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) models for graph data, showing label noise depends on node relationships. It compares three EDN variants, highlighting their impact on GNNs and noise-robust algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise models (SLN, CCN) ignore graph topology. EDN addresses this by considering node connections, which is crucial for real-world graph data.

Method: Three EDN variants are explored, focusing on node degree's role in label corruption. Experiments use 5 GNN architectures and 8 noise-robust algorithms on graph datasets.

Result: Two EDN variants cause more performance degradation in GNNs and noise-robust algorithms than traditional models, verified statistically.

Conclusion: Incorporating EDN is essential for reliable evaluation of noise-robust algorithms in graph-based learning.

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

### [254] [The Effect of Stochasticity in Score-Based Diffusion Sampling: a KL Divergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11378)
*Bernardo P. Schaeffer,Ricardo M. S. Rosa,Glauco Valle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of stochasticity in score-based diffusion models on generation quality, using KL divergence bounds and numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochasticity affects the generation process in diffusion models and quantify error propagation under different stochasticity choices.

Method: The study uses theoretical bounds derived from log-Sobolev inequalities for forward process marginals, complemented by numerical and analytical examples.

Result: Stochasticity acts as an error-correcting mechanism for exact scores but involves a trade-off for approximate scores, affecting performance based on score error structure.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the nuanced role of stochasticity in diffusion models, with implications for optimizing generation quality.

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

*Riddhiman Raut,Romit Maulik,Shivam Barwey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIGNN is a new GNN architecture improving interpretability in deep learning surrogate models for unstructured grids, using feature-specific pooling and mask-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs lack clarity in spatial influences for multivariate predictions, which FIGNN aims to address.

Method: FIGNN introduces feature-specific pooling and mask-based regularization to enhance interpretability and predictive alignment.

Result: FIGNN shows competitive predictive performance and reveals meaningful spatial patterns in atmospheric and fluid dynamics models.

Conclusion: FIGNN is a versatile framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical systems.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

### [256] [LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11402)
*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT methods like LoRA can lead models to rely on spurious tokens for decision-making, enabling control via SSTI, with varying impacts based on LoRA rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate catastrophic failures in PEFT, particularly how spurious tokens can dominate model decisions and enable SSTI attacks.

Method: Applied SSTI across three model families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, Meta LLaMA-3) and four datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, Bias in Bios) to study reliance on spurious tokens.

Result: Found that even a single SSTI token can control model decisions, reliance scales with LoRA rank, and higher ranks improve robustness against aggressive SSTI.

Conclusion: PEFT's efficiency comes with vulnerabilities; understanding and mitigating spurious token reliance is crucial for robust fine-tuning.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

### [257] [Byzantine Outside, Curious Inside: Reconstructing Data Through Malicious Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11413)
*Kai Yue,Richeng Jin,Chau-Wai Wong,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new threat model in federated learning (FL) where a malicious client manipulates gradients to infer peers' private data, bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to privacy leakage, and current defenses may unintentionally worsen data exposure.

Method: The authors define the threat model, analyze its theoretical feasibility, and develop a reconstruction algorithm combining gradient inversion and malicious updates.

Result: The attack succeeds in data reconstruction, and standard defenses may amplify leakage by 10-15%.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical blind spot in FL defenses, urging reevaluation of current privacy mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

*Linlin Wang,Tianqing Zhu,Laiqiao Qin,Longxiang Gao,Wanlei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework to study how poisoning attacks in RAG systems amplify biases in large language models, proposes a defense mechanism, and highlights the need for fairness in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on RAG systems overlooks how poisoning attacks can amplify model biases, particularly in sensitive topics like gender stereotypes.

Method: The BRRA framework includes adversarial document generation, subspace projection for retrieval manipulation, and a cyclic feedback mechanism for bias amplification. Experiments validate its impact on model biases.

Result: BRRA attacks significantly enhance biases in large language models, and a dual-stage defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate these effects.

Conclusion: Poisoning attacks in RAG systems amplify biases, linking system security to model fairness, necessitating attention to RAG fairness issues.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

TL;DR: PPDiff, a diffusion model, designs high-affinity protein binders for arbitrary targets using a non-autoregressive approach, outperforming baselines in pretraining and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of creating high-affinity protein binders for arbitrary targets without extensive lab testing drives the need for advanced computational methods.

Method: PPDiff uses SSINC, integrating self-attention, kNN graph layers, and causal attention to model sequence and structure. It's trained on PPBench (706,360 complexes) and fine-tuned for mini-binder and antigen-antibody design.

Result: PPDiff achieves success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% in pretraining and two downstream tasks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PPDiff demonstrates effective protein binder design, offering a scalable solution for biomedical and biotech applications.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying complex models on edge devices due to size and latency constraints, with truncation offering efficiency but lacking suitable training schemes.

Method: Proposes TruncQuant, aligning training with truncation output for flexible bit precision through bit-shifting, ensuring robustness and compatibility with existing frameworks.

Result: Demonstrates strong robustness across bit-width settings and provides an easily implementable solution.

Conclusion: TruncQuant effectively addresses the gap in truncation-aware training, offering a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

TL;DR: DynaDiag introduces a structured sparse-to-sparse DST method with diagonal sparsity, matching unstructured sparsity performance while enabling hardware-friendly speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured sparsity often lacks practical speedups on modern hardware, prompting the need for structured sparsity methods like DynaDiag.

Method: DynaDiag enforces diagonal sparsity, preserves sparse computation, and uses a custom CUDA kernel for acceleration.

Result: Achieves 3.13x inference speedup and 1.59x training speedup on GPUs without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: DynaDiag bridges the gap between theoretical sparsity benefits and practical hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

TL;DR: The paper identifies a bias in multimodal Transformers where models favor one modality, reducing dynamic adaptability. It proposes Rolling Query (RollingQ) to balance attention and restore adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the diminishing dynamic adaptability in multimodal learning due to modality bias, which disrupts effective fusion of diverse modalities.

Method: Introduces Rolling Query (RollingQ), a method to rotate queries and break the self-reinforcing cycle of modality bias, balancing attention allocation.

Result: RollingQ effectively restores dynamic adaptability and cooperation in multimodal Transformers, validated across various scenarios.

Conclusion: RollingQ is a simple yet effective solution to revive adaptability in multimodal learning, enhancing the broader capabilities of Transformers.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the data inefficiency of RL in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Method: Introduces LearnAlign, using gradient alignment and data learnability based on success rate to select representative training data.

Result: Reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 points, achieving 77.53% performance on GSM8K vs. 77.04% with full data.

Conclusion: Provides insights for data-efficient RL post-training and sets a foundation for future research in reasoning data selection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Method: The study evaluates statistical and non-statistical machine learning methods (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (768 samples) using features like age, BMI, and blood glucose levels.

Result: Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy (78.57%), followed by Random Forests (76.30%).

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively predict diabetes risk, aiding early screening and timely intervention to reduce health burdens.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to
avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent
years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting
diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study
highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical
machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from
the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic
and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels
that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation
assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy
and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health
outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models were trained on VCUG images to objectively diagnose VUR, achieving high accuracy and identifying renal calyceal deformation as a key predictor of severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subjective grading of VUR introduces diagnostic variability; this study aims to improve consistency using machine learning.

Method: Six models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Network) were trained on nine image-based features from 113 VCUG images, evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation.

Result: All models achieved accurate classifications (no false positives/negatives) with high sensitivity, confirmed by substantial AUC values. Renal calyceal deformation was a key indicator of high-grade VUR.

Conclusion: Machine learning provides an objective alternative to subjective VUR assessment, with renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor. Future work should expand datasets and refine features for clinical use.

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

*Tung-Long Vuong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A task-driven framework for deep discrete representation learning (DRL) is proposed, evaluating discrete features' usefulness for downstream tasks, with theoretical analysis on trade-offs and practical demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL frameworks focus on generative settings, leaving the quality and utility of discrete representations ambiguously defined. This work aims to clarify and evaluate DRL from a task-driven perspective.

Method: A unified framework is introduced to assess discrete features' role in downstream tasks, including theoretical analysis of representational capacity vs. sample complexity.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness across diverse applications, highlighting the impact of discrete representation utilization on task performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical and theoretical foundation for understanding and applying discrete representations in task-driven contexts, beyond generative settings.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

### [268] [Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in Time-Series LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11512)
*Wei Li,Yunyao Cheng,Xinli Hao,Chaohong Ma,Yuxuan Liang,Bin Yang,Christian S. Jensen,Xiaofeng Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift in time-series reasoning with LLMs, focusing on aligning with intrinsic data primitives (domain, characteristic, representation) rather than task-specific customization, introducing three alignment paradigms for efficient reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series reasoning approaches are costly and inflexible due to task-specific model customization, overlooking intrinsic data primitives.

Method: Proposes three alignment paradigms (Injective, Bridging, Internal) based on time-series primitives to enhance LLM reasoning.

Result: Alignment paradigms enable economical, flexible, and efficient time-series reasoning by leveraging intrinsic data structure.

Conclusion: Prioritizing alignment with data primitives over task-specific customization improves LLM-based time-series reasoning, with future research directions outlined.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

TL;DR: The paper interprets in-context learning (ICL) as implicit knowledge distillation (KD), providing a theoretical framework to explain its mechanisms and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the poorly understood mechanism behind ICL, enabling better interpretation, improvement, and reliable application.

Method: Proposes a theoretical perspective viewing ICL as implicit KD, deriving a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and analyzing bias growth with MMD.

Result: The framework explains empirical phenomena and unifies prior analyses, formalizing inference-time attention as distillation.

Conclusion: This is the first to formalize ICL as KD, offering theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and demonstration selection.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

*Zijian Wang,Peng Tao,Luonan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delayformer is a novel framework for high-dimensional time-series prediction using delay-embedded states and Transformers, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of high-dimensional, noisy time-series data is challenging due to nonlinearity and complex interactions. Existing methods, including deep learning, often fail in real-world scenarios.

Method: Delayformer uses a multivariate spatiotemporal transformation (mvSTI) to convert variables into delay-embedded states, cross-learned via a shared ViT encoder and linear decoders.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating broad applicability in cross-domain forecasting.

Conclusion: Delayformer effectively addresses nonlinearity and cross-interaction challenges, proving to be a foundational time-series model with wide applicability.

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

### [271] [Robust Filtering -- Novel Statistical Learning and Inference Algorithms with Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11530)
*Aamir Hussain Chughtai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel robust nonlinear filtering methods address noise abnormalities in state estimation, extending to offline learning and smoothing, validated in diverse applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios involve unknown noise statistics (outliers, biases, etc.), limiting conventional filtering methods.

Method: Leverages Bayesian inference (VI, SMC) and studies theoretical limits via BCRBs.

Result: Validated in simulations/experiments (e.g., target tracking, localization).

Conclusion: Fundamental work with future extensions in outlier-robust ML and generative AI.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

### [272] [Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11550)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen,Yongjian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes multimodal Data Remixing to address modality imbalance and enhance unimodal learning sufficiency in multimodal models, improving accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance, leading to modality laziness and clash.

Method: Multimodal Data Remixing involves decoupling data, filtering hard samples, and batch-level reassembling to align gradient directions.

Result: Improves accuracy by ~6.50% on CREMAD and ~3.41% on Kinetic-Sounds without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances and enhances multimodal learning, integrating seamlessly with existing approaches.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) to balance generalization and personalization, using recommendation systems as a testbed for decentralized, user-centric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tradeoff between generalization and personalization in Foundation Models (FMs) through decentralized adaptation.

Method: Introduces FFMs to decouple shared knowledge from individual adaptations, leveraging federated processes.

Result: FFMs enable personalized adaptive FMs for recommendation systems, preserving user personality integrity.

Conclusion: FFMs promise user-centric, decentralized systems where individuals control personalized agents for decision-making.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates influence-based signals for debugging training data in ML models, finding that Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples but no signal detects anomalies, highlighting limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving training sample quality is key for ML model reliability, and influence-based signals can help identify mislabeled or anomalous samples without dedicated glitch detectors.

Method: Comparative evaluation of influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Marginal Influence) under a common estimator (TraceIn) across data modalities (image, tabular) and deep learning models.

Result: Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples effectively, but no signal detects anomalies. Existing signals ignore training dynamics and suffer from influence cancellation effects.

Conclusion: Current influence-based signals have limitations in anomaly detection and training dynamics, suggesting a need for improved methods.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

*Yaning Jia,Shenyang Deng,Chiyu Ma,Yaoqing Yang,Soroush Vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KCES is a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework for GNNs that uses Graph Kernel Complexity to identify and prune adversarial edges, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses often rely on heuristics, overfit, or are computationally expensive.

Method: KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC) to score edges, pruning those with high scores (likely adversarial) to enhance robustness.

Result: KCES improves GNN robustness, outperforms baselines, and integrates well with other defenses.

Conclusion: KCES provides a principled, efficient solution for securing GNNs against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

*Edward Turner,Anna Soligo,Mia Taylor,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on narrowly harmful datasets can cause broad misalignment, termed Emergent Misalignment (EM). This work improves understanding and tools for studying EM, achieving higher coherence and efficiency with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of EM revealed unexpected gaps in model alignment understanding, highlighting the need for better tools and insights to address alignment risks in LLMs.

Method: Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, the study creates improved model organisms with higher coherence, smaller parameter sizes (0.5B vs. 32B), and single rank-1 LoRA adapters. It tests EM across diverse model sizes, families, and training protocols.

Result: The study demonstrates EM's robustness and isolates a mechanistic phase transition linked to behavioral changes. It achieves 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior) and works efficiently with smaller models.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational tools for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment risks in LLMs, emphasizing the critical need for robust alignment in frontier AI safety.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

*Deliang Jin,Gang Chen,Shuo Feng,Yufeng Ling,Haoran Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and targeted fine-tuning to mitigate noisy training data impact, improving accuracy and efficiency without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer performance degradation from noisy training data, and conventional methods are impractical for large-scale models due to restrictive assumptions or extensive retraining.

Method: The framework uses gradient-based attribution to identify high-quality data, regression-based sensitivity analysis to prune noise-vulnerable neurons, and fine-tuning on clean data.

Result: Achieves ~10% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10 with label noise and reduces retraining time by up to 47%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances robust generalization in noisy environments without full retraining or explicit noise modeling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent misalignment in fine-tuned large language models, identifying convergence in misaligned behaviors and proposing methods to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind emergent misalignment in fine-tuned models and why it generalizes beyond the training domain.

Method: Train a minimal model with 9 rank-1 adapters to study misalignment, extract a 'misalignment direction,' and use it to ablate misaligned behavior in higher-dimensional LoRAs.

Result: Different misaligned models converge to similar representations, and a 'misalignment direction' can effectively mitigate misaligned behavior. Six adapters contribute to general misalignment, while two specialize in domain-specific misalignment.

Conclusion: Advancing understanding of emergent misalignment can help mitigate undesirable model behaviors more broadly.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

*Daniel James Pitchforth,Matthew Rhys Jones,Samuel John Gibson,Elizabeth Jane Cross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces change-point kernels for Gaussian processes to dynamically balance physics and data reliance in models, tested on engineering case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing physics and data in models is crucial to avoid over-reliance on inaccurate physics or underuse of valuable physical knowledge.

Method: Develops novel change-point kernels for Gaussian processes, allowing dynamic adjustment of physics reliance based on user-defined conditions or learned automatically.

Result: The method provides interpretable control over physics-data balance and noise variation, demonstrated in bridge wind loading and aircraft wing strain case studies.

Conclusion: The approach effectively optimizes physics-data balance, enhancing model adaptability and uncertainty representation in real-world applications.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pooling layers in GNNs often sacrifice fundamental graph structures and interpretability for task optimization, leading to unreliable performance.

Method: Proposes structure-aware pooling via edge collapses, leveraging diffusion geometry and diversity measures (magnitude and spread) to preserve graph properties.

Result: Achieves superior performance in graph classification, preserves spectral properties, and maintains accuracy across pooling ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed pooling layers offer a robust solution for balancing performance, structure preservation, and computational efficiency in GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

*Lukas Fehring,Marius Lindauer,Theresa Eimer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrowNN is a method for training RL agents by progressively growing network layers, improving performance over static networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large networks for RL is challenging, limiting policy complexity. GrowNN aims to increase capacity while maintaining trainability.

Method: Start with a small network, then progressively add layers without altering the encoded function, allowing more expressive policies.

Result: Experiments show GrowNN outperforms static networks by up to 48% on MiniHack and 72% on Ant.

Conclusion: GrowNN effectively enhances RL agent performance by incrementally increasing network capacity.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

### [282] [Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743)
*Antonin Joly,Nicolas Keriven,Aline Roumy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more general notion of reduction matrices in graph coarsening, not strictly tied to pseudo-inverses of lifting matrices, to further minimize information loss (RSA). It explores admissible reduction matrices, their properties, and their impact on graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coarsening frameworks fix reduction matrices as pseudo-inverses of lifting matrices, limiting flexibility. The paper argues for asymmetry in their roles and seeks to generalize reduction matrices to improve RSA.

Method: The paper proposes a taxonomy of admissible reduction matrices, discusses their properties, and explores optimization of RSA. Examples include constrained optimization and applications in graph neural networks.

Result: Modifying reduction matrices for fixed lifting matrices reduces RSA. The approach is validated through examples and node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.

Conclusion: Generalizing reduction matrices beyond pseudo-inverses of lifting matrices enhances flexibility and reduces RSA, benefiting applications like graph neural networks.

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

*Markus Gambietz,Eva Dorschky,Altan Akat,Marcel Schöckel,Jörg Miehling,Anne D. Koelewijn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSPINNpose is a self-supervised, physics-informed neural network for real-time estimation of joint kinematics and kinetics from IMU data, eliminating the need for ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current real-time methods rely on supervised learning with lab-measured ground truth, which is error-prone and impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network to estimate joint dynamics from IMU data, optimizing physical plausibility with a physics model and virtual sensor data.

Result: Accurately estimates joint angles (8.7 deg RMSD) and moments (4.9 BWBH% RMSD) for walking/running at 4.9 m/s with 3.5 ms latency.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose is scalable and adaptable for real-time biomechanical analysis in lab and field settings.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

### [284] [Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790)
*Gregor Baer,Isel Grau,Chao Zhang,Pieter Van Gorp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates class-dependent effects in evaluating feature attribution methods in XAI, showing that perturbation-based metrics and ground truth metrics often contradict, suggesting caution in their interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability of perturbation-based metrics in evaluating feature attribution methods, especially given class-dependent effects that raise concerns about their validity.

Method: Controlled experiments with synthetic time series data, varying feature types and class contrasts, comparing perturbation-based and ground truth metrics.

Result: Class-dependent effects arise even in simple scenarios, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches, leading to contradictory assessments of attribution quality.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based metrics should be interpreted carefully, and more comprehensive evaluation frameworks are needed to capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

*Hwiwon Lee,Ziqi Zhang,Hanxiao Lu,Lingming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEC-bench is an automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on real security tasks, revealing significant performance gaps in PoC generation (18.0%) and vulnerability patching (34.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents lack realism, failing to capture the complexity of real-world security engineering tasks.

Method: SEC-bench uses a multi-agent scaffold to create reproducible vulnerability datasets and evaluates LLM agents on PoC generation and vulnerability patching.

Result: LLM agents achieved low success rates: 18.0% in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for further development to make LLM agents more practical and autonomous for security engineering.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

*Qihai Zhang,Xinyue Sheng,Yuanfu Sun,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TrustGLM, a study evaluating GraphLLMs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks across text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations, revealing significant susceptibility and proposing defense techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations is unexplored, posing risks for high-stakes applications.

Method: TrustGLM assesses GraphLLMs using state-of-the-art attack algorithms on text, graph structure, and prompts, testing resilience on six datasets.

Result: GraphLLMs are highly vulnerable to text and graph structure attacks, with prompt shuffling also degrading performance. Defense techniques show promise.

Conclusion: The study highlights GraphLLMs' vulnerabilities, proposes defenses, and provides an open-sourced library to foster further research.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

general theory and derive simple, near-optimal algorithms for online learning,

*R. Teal Witter,Yurong Liu,Christopher Musco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method combines Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression for efficient approximation of probabilistic values in explainable AI, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic values (e.g., Shapley, Banzhaf) are key in explainable AI but computationally expensive. Prior work uses Monte Carlo or linear regression; this paper aims to combine both for better efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Proposes a flexible approach combining Monte Carlo sampling with any function family (e.g., tree-based models like XGBoost) for unbiased estimates.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods: 6.5x lower error than Permutation SHAP, 3.8x lower than Kernel SHAP, and 2.6x lower than Leverage SHAP for Shapley values. For general probabilistic values, error is 215x lower than prior work.

Conclusion: The new method offers superior accuracy and flexibility for estimating probabilistic values, advancing explainable AI tools.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach improves generalization for molecular prediction models by leveraging unlabeled data to bridge in-distribution and out-of-distribution gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular prediction models struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution compounds, a critical need in drug discovery. Covariate shift and scarce labeled data worsen this issue.

Method: Proposes a meta-learning-based approach using unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with covariate shift.

Conclusion: The meta-learning approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in molecular prediction, offering practical benefits for drug discovery.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Motivation: Address diverse service demands (eMBB, URLLC) in vehicular networks with reliable and interpretable resource management.

Method: Uses Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) with Shapley values and attention mechanisms for decision refinement.

Conclusion: The XRL framework enhances real-time insights and reliability in vehicular network resource allocation.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies Mamba's input selectivity, showing its advantages in function approximation, memory retention, and associative recall, with theoretical and empirical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how Mamba's input selectivity enhances its performance over SSM predecessors and interacts with other operations in the architecture.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Mamba's S6 layer, including proofs of its capabilities in function approximation, memory decay counteraction, and associative recall tasks.

Result: Mamba's S6 layer outperforms S4D in approximating discontinuous functions, dynamically counteracts memory decay, and solves associative recall tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic understanding of Mamba, highlighting its strengths and suggesting areas for further improvement.

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

TL;DR: A defense system for transformer-based modulation classification is proposed to counter adversarial attacks, using a compact transformer for efficiency, and transferring adversarial attention maps from large to compact models for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in modulation classification, and efficient architectures are needed for IoT applications with limited power.

Method: Proposes a compact transformer for modulation classification and transfers adversarial attention maps from robustly trained large transformers to enhance robustness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques against white-box attacks like fast gradient method and projected gradient descent.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness in compact transformers and protects against adversarial example transferability, with potential applications in IoT.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle conflicting signals in prior and measurement, especially with non-Gaussian or unknown noise.

Method: Proposes Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), unifying and extending approaches like DDNM and DAPS, with an optimization perspective.

Result: MAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks, handling Gaussian, unknown, or non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: MAS provides a flexible and effective solution for inverse problems, improving performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient online learning and Bayesian inference in neural networks for sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: Combines low-rank updates for hidden layers and full-rank updates for the final layer, avoiding replay buffers or offline retraining.

Result: Achieves a competitive balance between speed and accuracy in non-stationary contextual bandit and Bayesian optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for online learning with well-defined posterior predictive distributions.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural rejection system to defend against universal adversarial perturbations in radio signal classification, showing higher accuracy than undefended networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning excels in radio signal classification but is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially universal ones, which are data-independent and highly effective.

Method: The authors introduce a neural rejection system and evaluate it by generating white-box universal adversarial perturbations.

Result: The proposed system defends against universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher accuracy than undefended deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The neural rejection system is an effective defense against universal adversarial perturbations in radio signal classification.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

*Zhenyu Hou,Ziniu Hu,Yujiang Li,Rui Lu,Jie Tang,Yuxiao Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeRL integrates on-policy tree search into RL training for LLMs, improving exploration and efficiency without needing a separate reward model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL with chain sampling lacks efficient exploration and suffers from reward model issues like distribution mismatch.

Method: TreeRL uses intermediate supervision and strategic branching from high-uncertainty steps for cost-effective tree search.

Result: TreeRL outperforms ChainRL on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TreeRL demonstrates the potential of tree search in LLM RL, offering better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

*Yufeng Wang,Peiyao Wang,Lu Ma,Yuewei Lin,Qun Liu,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XAStruct is a machine learning framework for predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors, trained on a diverse dataset of 70+ elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of expert-driven analysis and computationally expensive simulations in XAS interpretation by leveraging machine learning.

Method: XAStruct uses deep neural networks for complex mappings and baseline models for simpler tasks, trained independently for optimal performance.

Result: The framework generalizes across diverse chemistries and bonding environments, enabling accurate prediction of XAS spectra and local structural descriptors.

Conclusion: XAStruct provides a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis, with potential for broad application in materials science.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

### [298] [Breaking Habits: On the Role of the Advantage Function in Learning Causal State Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11912)
*Miguel Suau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The advantage function in reinforcement learning reduces policy confounding by breaking spurious correlations, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy confounding, where agents exploit spurious correlations, hinders generalization. The advantage function may mitigate this.

Method: Adjusts action values relative to state representation, downweighting policy-likely state-action pairs to break spurious correlations.

Result: Analytical and empirical evidence shows improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Conclusion: The advantage function not only reduces gradient variance but also mitigates policy confounding, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

*Dibya Ghosh,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to treat self-supervised image pre-training as a reinforcement learning problem, improving feature learning on unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between self-supervised image pre-training and reinforcement learning by leveraging the similarity in their formulations.

Method: Cast pre-training on unlabeled images as an RL problem, training a general value function where an agent transforms images via view changes or augmentations.

Result: Improved representations when training on diverse unlabeled datasets like EpicKitchens, COCO, and CC12M.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates RL with self-supervised pre-training, offering a flexible way to shape feature learning using curated or weakly labeled data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

*Ankit Bhardwaj,Rohail Asim,Sachin Chauhan,Yasir Zaki,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based traffic control protocol for free-flow roads improves throughput and reduces congestion without new infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing traffic congestion in free-flow road networks due to increased commuter inflow and limited infrastructure, with traditional controls being ineffective.

Method: Integrates traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL framework, using super-segments to capture flow dynamics.

Result: Improves throughput by 5%, reduces delay by 13%, and decreases stops by 3% in simulations, achieving smoother, congestion-resistant flow.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for scalable, ML-driven traffic management in free-flow environments.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

TL;DR: CACTUS unifies compression and certified robustness in deep neural networks, achieving high accuracy and robustness even when compressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing efficiency and robustness in safety-critical, resource-constrained environments without compromising either.

Method: Proposes CACTUS, a framework integrating compression and certified robustness during training, applied to pruning and quantization.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for pruning and quantization across datasets.

Conclusion: CACTUS effectively trains models that maintain high accuracy and robustness post-compression.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained
environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat
compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

### [302] [pLSTM: parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11997)
*Korbinian Pöppel,Richard Freinschlag,Thomas Schmied,Wei Lin,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) for multi-dimensional data, extending linear RNNs to handle DAGs efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures like xLSTM and Mamba are limited to sequences or require predefined orders for multi-dimensional data, while MDRNNs are better suited for structured data. The goal is to extend linear RNNs to multi-dimensionality.

Method: pLSTMs use Source, Transition, and Mark gates on the line graph of a DAG, enabling parallelization akin to associative scans. They handle vanishing/exploding gradients via P-mode and D-mode.

Result: pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes and outperform Transformers in extrapolation tasks. They also perform strongly on molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: pLSTMs effectively address the limitations of existing architectures for multi-dimensional data, offering parallelizable and scalable solutions for DAGs and grids.

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

TL;DR: Efficient compression of neural network training checkpoints using prediction-based arithmetic coding, pruning, and quantization, achieving near-lossless recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce storage requirements for neural network training checkpoints without compromising model performance.

Method: Proposes prediction-based arithmetic coding for compression, enhanced by pruning and quantization of checkpoint values.

Result: Substantial bit size reduction with near-lossless training recovery, preserving model performance.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for storage-limited environments while maintaining model integrity.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

*Paul Setinek,Gianluca Galletti,Thomas Gross,Dominik Schnürer,Johannes Brandstetter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMSHIFT, a benchmark for evaluating neural surrogates in PDEs under unseen configurations, and applies domain adaptation techniques to improve their generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates for PDEs perform poorly on unseen configurations, while domain adaptation techniques in vision/language show promise for generalization.

Method: Introduces SIMSHIFT dataset and extends domain adaptation methods to neural surrogates, using parametric descriptions and simulations from source/target configurations.

Result: Experiments reveal challenges in out-of-distribution neural surrogate modeling but demonstrate DA's potential in simulation tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights open problems in robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts and provides a codebase for further research.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

*Hsi-Che Lin,Yu-Chu Yu,Kai-Po Chang,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMLoC is a memory-efficient framework for fine-tuning large foundation models, enabling adaptation within the same memory budget as inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large models is expensive due to high memory overhead, limiting accessibility for users.

Method: Uses activation-aware SVD to create a lightweight emulator, fine-tunes via LoRA, and corrects misalignment with a novel compensation algorithm.

Result: Outperforms baselines across datasets and enables fine-tuning a 38B model on a 24GB GPU.

Conclusion: EMLoC makes model adaptation practical and efficient for individual users.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

*Chuan He,Zhaosong Lu,Defeng Sun,Zhanwang Deng*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Proposes normalized stochastic first-order methods with various momentum techniques for unconstrained optimization, improving complexity bounds under weaker assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop practical optimization methods that do not rely on problem-dependent quantities like Lipschitz constants or noise bounds, and perform well under weaker assumptions (heavy-tailed noise, weak average smoothness).

Method: Uses dynamically updated parameters and incorporates Polyak, multi-extrapolated, and recursive momentum techniques.

Result: Achieves improved or matched first-order oracle complexity bounds under weaker conditions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are effective and practical, with theoretical and numerical validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

*Yingrui Zhuang,Lin Cheng,Yuji Cao,Tongxin Li,Ning Qi,Yan Xu,Yue Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A quantum learning and estimation approach (Q-TCN-LSTM) is proposed to improve coordination between distribution networks and energy communities, addressing information limitations and computational burdens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in coordination due to limited information (aggregated energy usage) and high computational costs for uncertainty scenarios.

Method: Developed a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-LSTM (Q-TCN-LSTM) model and a quantum estimation method using quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and phase-rotation circuits.

Result: Q-TCN-LSTM improves mapping accuracy by 69.2%, reduces model size by 99.75%, and cuts computation time by 93.9%. QAE matches classical accuracy with up to 99.99% faster computation.

Conclusion: The quantum approach significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy in DN-EC coordination, outperforming classical methods.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

TL;DR: A unified stochastic optimization algorithm with momentum, generalizing SHB and SNAG, is presented. It allows time-varying momentum and handles biased, unbounded-variance gradients, applicable to zero-order methods. Convergence conditions are provided, and a prior method is critiqued as impractical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and unify stochastic optimization algorithms (SHB and SNAG) with momentum, accommodating biased and unbounded-variance gradients, especially for zero-order methods.

Method: Proposes a unified algorithm with time-varying momentum, handling biased gradients and unbounded conditional variance. Provides convergence conditions generalizing Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum.

Result: Convergence conditions for the unified algorithm are established, and a prior method for SHB with time-varying momentum is shown to be impractical.

Conclusion: The unified algorithm is versatile, handling general stochastic gradients, and its convergence conditions are validated, while a prior approach is deemed impractical.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

Result: RecFound achieves state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: RecFound successfully addresses key challenges in recommendation foundation models, demonstrating superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to handle massive user requests and complex models efficiently while maintaining recommendation quality.

Method: Lightweight network design, pruning, quantization at the model level; heterogeneous compute platforms, high-performance libraries, and elastic scheduling at the system level.

Result: Latency reduced to <30% of baseline, throughput more than doubled, with no loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for scalable, efficient online recommendation services.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP struggles with implicit causal links in low-data scenarios; this framework aims to enhance accuracy and consistency in causal reasoning.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: Data Preparation (annotating news into causal graphs), Graph Retrieval (hybrid retrieval using Neo4j), and LLM Inference (few-shot learning with XML prompts).

Result: Achieves 82.1% F1-score on causal classification with just 20 few-shot examples.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Causal is effective for real-time applications like news reliability assessment and misinformation detection.

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs can reduce AI energy demands, but existing accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) are inefficient for SNNs due to their high arithmetic intensity. FPGAs, with high memory bandwidth, are better suited.

Method: Developed FeNN, a programmable RISC-V-based soft vector processor for SNN simulation on FPGAs, using stochastic rounding and saturation for precision.

Result: FeNN simulates SNNs faster than embedded GPUs and Loihi, achieving high precision with low hardware utilization.

Conclusion: FeNN is a promising, programmable solution for efficient SNN simulation on FPGAs, suitable for edge to cloud applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

### [313] [HQFNN: A Compact Quantum-Fuzzy Neural Network for Accurate Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11146)
*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) combining fuzzy inference and quantum circuits for robust, interpretable, and efficient image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of deep learning in handling noisy inputs and explaining confidence, while leveraging quantum efficiency and fuzzy transparency.

Method: HQFNN maps image features to qubit states via angle reuploading, refines them with a rule layer, and collapses them into crisp values fused with classical features for classification.

Result: HQFNN outperforms classical, fuzzy, and quantum baselines with fewer weights, shows robustness to noise, and scales sublinearly with input size.

Conclusion: HQFNN is a compact, interpretable, and noise-tolerant alternative for vision tasks, offering a template for quantum-native fuzzy learning.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

*Nico Meyer,Christopher Mutschler,Andreas Maier,Daniel D. Scherer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel method, VarQEC, optimizes quantum error correction by tailoring codes to specific noise structures, outperforming traditional codes and demonstrating practical viability on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantum error correction codes like the surface code are resource-intensive, making them unsuitable for near-term devices. Addressing this inefficiency is critical for practical quantum computing.

Method: The paper introduces a distinguishability loss function to maximize state distinguishability post-noise, using variational techniques (VarQEC) to discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for specific noise.

Result: VarQEC produces codes with superior theoretical and practical performance compared to standard codes, validated by demonstrations on IBM and IQM hardware.

Conclusion: VarQEC offers a promising, resource-efficient solution for quantum error correction, adaptable to specific noise structures and practical for near-term devices.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

*Paulin de Schoulepnikoff,Gorka Muñoz-Gil,Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup,Hans J. Briegel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: VAEs modified for quantum data can extract meaningful physical features without supervision, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of VAEs in handling quantum data's randomness and correlations for interpretable machine learning.

Method: Two key modifications: a decoder for faithful quantum state reproduction and a probabilistic loss tailored for quantum data.

Result: Successfully identified meaningful latent representations in benchmark quantum spin models and experimental Rydberg atom arrays.

Conclusion: The modified VAEs offer a powerful unsupervised and interpretable tool for studying quantum systems.

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

### [316] [Decadal sink-source shifts of forest aboveground carbon since 1988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11879)
*Zhen Qian,Sebastian Bathiany,Teng Liu,Lana L. Blaschke,Hoong Chen Teo,Niklas Boers*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The study integrates satellite data and deep learning to analyze global forest carbon dynamics from 1988-2021, revealing shifts in carbon sinks and sources, especially in tropical and boreal forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding long-term forest carbon dynamics is crucial for climate change mitigation, but uncertainties persist due to inconsistent methods and disturbance regimes.

Method: Multi-source satellite observations combined with probabilistic deep learning models to estimate AGC stocks and fluxes with high reliability.

Result: Global forests remained a carbon sink (6.2 PgC over 30 years), but tropical and boreal forests shifted to sources. Deforestation's role in carbon loss declined, while untouched areas' contribution rose.

Conclusion: Tropical forests increasingly influence carbon cycle variability, with climate change potentially driving carbon changes in untouched regions.

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A novel ML-based framework using laser-induced cavitation and a Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT) enables fast, accurate, non-contact characterization of soft materials at ultra-high strain rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rheological tools are limited in high strain rate regimes, necessitating a new approach to study soft biological material mechanics.

Method: Ultra-high-speed imaging captures bubble dynamics during laser-induced cavitation, analyzed by a physics-trained neural network (BDT) to infer viscoelastic properties.

Result: The BDT accurately infers material parameters without iterative fitting, enabling efficient characterization under extreme conditions.

Conclusion: This ML-based framework offers a powerful tool for biomedical and materials science applications, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effect of anisotropy in pretrained speech representations on downstream tasks like keyword spotting in computational documentary linguistics.

Result: Despite anisotropy, wav2vec2 effectively identifies words, demonstrating robustness and generalization across speakers.

Conclusion: Pretraining is crucial for learning rich, invariant speech representations, as shown by the robustness of wav2vec2 in keyword spotting.

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLAP methods are limited to English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. GLAP aims to bridge this gap.

Method: GLAP expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain capabilities, evaluated on benchmarks like Clotho, AudioCaps, and speech tasks.

Result: GLAP achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks and excels in multilingual tasks, including keyword spotting across 50 languages.

Conclusion: GLAP demonstrates superior versatility and multilingual capabilities, making it a robust alternative to CLAP for diverse audio-text applications.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

### [320] [(SimPhon Speech Test): A Data-Driven Method for In Silico Design and Validation of a Phonetically Balanced Speech Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11620)
*Stefan Bleeck*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SimPhon Speech Test, a computational method to design a phonetically balanced speech test for diagnosing hearing loss, outperforming traditional audiometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audiometry fails to fully capture the functional impact of hearing loss, especially supra-threshold deficits in presbycusis, necessitating more specific diagnostic tests.

Method: The SimPhon Speech Test uses an ASR system to simulate hearing loss, identifies phoneme confusion patterns, curates word pairs, and optimizes them through simulated testing and expert review.

Result: The final SimPhon Speech Test-25 shows no correlation with the Speech Intelligibility Index, indicating it captures deficits beyond audibility.

Conclusion: The SimPhon Speech Test offers an efficient, optimized tool for audiological testing, ready for human trials.

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A correlation-permutation method merges speech and music encoders by aligning their layers, improving music performance without losing speech capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating a unified speech and music model is costly; model merging offers a cheaper alternative but requires alignment in weight space.

Method: A correlation-permutation approach aligns layers of a music encoder with a speech encoder, extending Git Re-Basin to transformers.

Result: The merged model improves music performance by 14.83 points over linear interpolation, retaining speech capabilities.

Conclusion: This method enables unified audio models from independently trained encoders with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

TL;DR: A lightweight, modular architecture improves fine-grained control in text-to-audio diffusion models, reducing memory usage while matching ControlNet's quality and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-audio diffusion models lack fine-grained, time-varying controls for music production, and ControlNet's approach is memory-intensive and inflexible.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, modular architecture to reduce parameters and memory usage while maintaining audio quality and condition adherence.

Result: Matches ControlNet in quality and control adherence, with significantly lower memory usage and greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient training and deployment of independent controls, enhancing practicality for music production.

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the

*Daniil Kocharov,Okko Räsänen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automatically detect and transcribe reliable utterances in longform child-centered audio recordings, improving transcription accuracy compared to unfiltered ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longform audio recordings are valuable for studying children's language development, but manual transcription is impractical and existing ASR methods struggle with noisy, unconstrained data.

Method: The approach identifies utterances in longform audio that can be accurately transcribed by modern ASR systems, filtering out unreliable segments.

Result: Validated on four English corpora, the method achieves a median WER of 0% and mean WER of 18% for 13% of speech, outperforming unfiltered ASR (median WER 52%). Word frequency correlations with manual annotations are high (r=0.92-0.98).

Conclusion: This work advances automated linguistic analysis of child-centered longform audio by enabling reliable partial transcription.

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize novel sounds that go beyond simple additive superposition by fusing original and reference sounds, creating abstract sounds without identifiable real-world events.

Method: Employ inversion techniques to preserve essential features of the original sound while enabling controllable synthesis. Novel SDE and ODE inversion models are proposed, using DPMSolver++ samplers to reverse the sampling process.

Result: The method achieves sound fusion without prompt conditioning, maintaining flexible guidance during sampling and eliminating circular dependencies from noise prediction terms.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion approach effectively synthesizes abstract sounds, offering a controllable and flexible framework for sound fusion.

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Conclusion: Reconceptualizes AI's role in performing arts as a responsive collaborator, expanding possibilities for professional and improvisational dance.

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

*Jianhong Wang,Yang Li,Samuel Kaski,Jonathan Lawry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game-theoretic approach to solve the n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) problem in open multi-agent systems, using Shapley values for credit assignment and proposing a novel RL algorithm called Shapley Machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for NAHT lack theoretical rigor and clear credit assignment. The paper aims to address these gaps by leveraging cooperative game theory.

Method: The authors model NAHT using cooperative game theory, extend the game and state spaces for dynamics, and derive Shapley values for credit assignment. They propose a TD($\lambda$)-like algorithm, Shapley Machine, to estimate Shapley values.

Result: The proposed Shapley Machine algorithm effectively solves NAHT, with experiments validating its performance and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges cooperative game theory and RL, offering a rigorous and practical solution for NAHT in open multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In

### [328] [Polymorphism Crystal Structure Prediction with Adaptive Space Group Diversity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11332)
*Sadman Sadeed Omee,Lai Wei,Sourin Dey,Jianjun Hu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: ParetoCSP2 is a multi-objective genetic algorithm for predicting inorganic polymorph structures, improving accuracy and convergence speed over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSP algorithms for inorganic polymorphs are limited; ParetoCSP2 aims to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses adaptive space group diversity control, neural network interatomic potential, improved initialization, and iterative relaxation.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 2.46-8.62x in accuracy for polymorph prediction and improves key metrics by 44.8%-87.04%.

Conclusion: ParetoCSP2 is effective for polymorph prediction, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

### [329] [GaussMarker: Robust Dual-Domain Watermark for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11444)
*Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinwen Hou,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaussMarker, a dual-domain watermarking approach for Diffusion Models (DM) that embeds watermarks in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing robustness against image manipulations and attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing copyright and misuse concerns in DM-generated images, current watermarking methods lack robustness.

Method: A pipelined injector embeds watermarks in dual domains (spatial and frequency), and a Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) refines noise for better detection.

Result: GaussMarker outperforms existing methods under various distortions and attacks, achieving higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Conclusion: GaussMarker is a robust solution for DM watermarking, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reviews security risks in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), focusing on adversarial, backdoor, and jailbreak attacks, and highlights gaps in existing surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of third-party data and open-source MLLMs raises security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to produce harmful content. Existing surveys lack a unified review of diverse attack types.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review of audio-visual attacks, including adversarial, backdoor, and jailbreak attacks, and analyzes their impact on MLLMs.

Result: The review identifies security vulnerabilities in MLLMs and provides insights into the latest attack trends, filling gaps in existing literature.

Conclusion: The paper outlines challenges and future research directions for securing audio-visual-based MLLMs against diverse attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

TL;DR: SecONNds is a secure inference framework for neural networks, addressing privacy challenges with optimized protocols and GPU acceleration, achieving significant speedups and reduced communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns arise from processing sensitive data on untrusted servers during outsourced neural network inference, with existing secure frameworks being impractical due to high overhead.

Method: SecONNds integrates a novel Boolean GMW protocol for secure comparison, uses preprocessed Beaver's bit triples, and employs NTT preprocessing and GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption.

Result: Achieves 17× speedup in nonlinear operations, 1.6× (CPU) and 2.2× (GPU) speedups for linear operations, with end-to-end inference times of 2.8 s (GPU) and 3.6 s (CPU), and 420 MiB communication.

Conclusion: SecONNds is efficient and practical for privacy-sensitive applications in resource-constrained environments, offering verifiable full-precision results and being open-source.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and

*Shaun Shuster,Eyal Zaloof,Asaf Shabtai,Rami Puzis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework using multi-modal LLMs to automate credit card fraud investigations, reducing analyst workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The e-commerce industry's growth has led to increased fraud, overwhelming analysts with alerts and causing alert fatigue.

Method: The FAA framework employs LLMs for reasoning, code execution, and vision to automate investigation steps like planning, evidence collection, and analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 500 fraud cases shows FAA reliably automates investigations, averaging seven steps per case.

Conclusion: FAA effectively reduces analyst workload by automating large parts of fraud investigations.

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in ML by ensuring algorithms do not reveal sensitive information, using DP as a formal framework.

Method: Reviews foundational DP definitions, traces its evolution, examines DP integration into ML models, and evaluates DP-based ML techniques.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of DP in ML, analyzing existing methods and their privacy-preserving capabilities.

Conclusion: Aims to advance secure and responsible AI by highlighting DP's potential, applications, and challenges, including adversarial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not

formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and mitigate security and privacy risks in mobile apps, replacing traditional methods like dynamic analysis. It highlights an LLM-based approach for detecting sensitive data leakage in shared images and discusses open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of security and privacy threats in mobile apps necessitates advanced detection methods. LLMs offer a promising alternative to traditional approaches.

Method: The study applies LLMs to identify and mitigate the top 10 common security risks in mobile apps, including detecting sensitive data leakage in shared images.

Result: LLMs demonstrate feasibility and potential to replace traditional analysis methods, offering efficient detection of security and privacy violations.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for enhancing mobile app security, but open research challenges remain in their broader application.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

### [335] [Today's Cat Is Tomorrow's Dog: Accounting for Time-Based Changes in the Labels of ML Vulnerability Detection Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11939)
*Ranindya Paramitha,Yuan Feng,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of retrospective bias in vulnerability datasets for ML testing, proposing a method to restructure datasets to reflect changing labels over time and validating it with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerability datasets often contain retrospective information, leading to misaligned past and future performance. Existing approaches are either too optimistic or conservative.

Method: Restructures datasets into a series where training and testing labels evolve with time, using the Mann-Kendall test to check performance trends.

Result: Performance trends across years are inconsistent, indicating most models fail to learn despite more data.

Conclusion: Proposed method highlights the need for time-aware evaluation in vulnerability detection, revealing limitations in current ML models.

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing and processing data securely without altering existing AI algorithms, HbHAI introduces key-dependent hash functions preserving data similarity.

Method: HbHAI uses novel key-dependent hash functions to secure data while maintaining similarity properties. Traditional AI algorithms were tested on HbHAI-protected datasets without modifications.

Result: Independent analysis confirmed HbHAI's security, operability, and performance claims, with only minor reservations.

Conclusion: HbHAI successfully enables secure data processing with unmodified AI algorithms, outperforming current homomorphic encryption methods.

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

### [337] [Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796)
*Elias Najarro,Nicolas Bessone,Sebastian Risi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: A novel inverse modeling method is introduced to handle stochasticity in self-organizing systems, using visual embeddings to recover causal parameters without handcrafted heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding natural complexity requires solving the inverse problem of finding causal parameters from stochastic macroscopic observations, where traditional methods fail.

Method: The method leverages visual embeddings to map pattern representations onto an invariant space, enabling robust parameter recovery.

Result: Tested on reaction-diffusion and agent-based models, the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity, and works on real biological patterns.

Conclusion: The method is a promising tool for studying stochastic pattern formation in both theoretical and experimental contexts.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

*Ido Guy,Daniel Haimovich,Fridolin Linder,Nastaran Okati,Lorenzo Perini,Niek Tax,Mark Tygert*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new metric for measuring multi-calibration is proposed, based on the Kuiper statistic, avoiding issues with binning or kernel density estimation. It weights subpopulations by signal-to-noise ratios, showing effectiveness in benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of perfect multi-calibration in probabilistic predictions, a robust metric is needed to measure the distance from ideal calibration across subpopulations.

Method: The proposed metric uses the Kuiper statistic, avoiding binning or kernel density estimation, and weights subpopulations by their signal-to-noise ratios.

Result: The metric performs well on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its utility, and becomes noisy if signal-to-noise ratios are omitted.

Conclusion: The new metric effectively measures multi-calibration, providing a reliable tool for evaluating probabilistic predictions across diverse subpopulations.

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper analyzes maximum likelihood estimation for bounded confidence models (BCMs), focusing on the confidence bound and convergence rate parameters. It highlights biases and identifiability issues in estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect opinion dynamics models (like BCMs) to real-world data for understanding consensus, fragmentation, or polarization phenomena and test model assumptions.

Method: Uses maximum likelihood estimation to analyze statistical estimators for the confidence bound and convergence rate parameters in BCMs.

Result: The confidence bound estimator has small-sample bias but is consistent, while the convergence rate estimator shows persistent bias. Joint estimation faces identifiability issues due to multiple local maxima in the likelihood function.

Conclusion: Analyzing the likelihood function helps understand challenges in estimating opinion dynamics model parameters, offering insights for calibration and broader agent-based models.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the parameter-shift rule (PSR) to compute gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs), overcoming challenges of backpropagation in optical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation is difficult to implement in optical neural networks due to physical constraints. PSR offers a viable alternative.

Method: PSR is adapted for UONNs using Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, leveraging optical interference's Fourier series nature for exact gradient computation.

Result: The method provides exact analytical gradients from hardware measurements, avoiding limitations of finite difference and all-optical backpropagation.

Conclusion: PSR presents a promising hardware-based training strategy for optical computing systems, advancing efficient training methods.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

TL;DR: PINNs show promise for modeling acoustic wave fields in 3D, but require careful tuning of parameters like training points per wavelength for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend PINNs from 2D to 3D for modeling room acoustics, addressing challenges like source realism, boundary conditions, and complex sound properties.

Method: Study 3D room acoustics at low frequencies, varying source definitions and boundary conditions, using a complex speed of sound model. Assess convergence via loss landscape and L² error against finite element simulations.

Result: At least six training points per wavelength are needed for accurate PINN predictions.

Conclusion: PINNs can model 3D room acoustics effectively with proper parameter tuning, supporting low-frequency behavior studies.

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals in MI-BCIs face issues like low signal-to-noise ratio and inter-subject variability, hindering model training.

Method: CLEAN-MI uses frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to standardize EEG data.

Result: CLEAN-MI improves data quality and classification performance across multiple public MI datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAN-MI provides a systematic solution for building robust, large-scale EEG datasets for MI-BCIs.

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying encrypted traffic on resource-constrained IoT and edge devices while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to optimize a 1D CNN on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset, focusing on memory and computational limits.

Result: Achieves 96.59% accuracy with significant reductions in parameters (444-fold), FLOPs (312-fold), and tensor size (15.6-fold). Also excels in VPN and application classification (up to 99.64% accuracy).

Conclusion: The method provides scalable, efficient solutions for real-time encrypted traffic analysis, emphasizing the need for careful preprocessing and session length selection to maintain performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

### [344] [Upgrade or Switch: Do We Need a New Registry Architecture for the Internet of AI Agents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003)
*Ramesh Raskar,Pradyumna Chari,Jared James Grogan,Mahesh Lambe,Robert Lincourt,Raghu Bala,Abhishek Singh,Ayush Chopra,Rajesh Ranjan,Shailja Gupta,Dimitris Stripelis,Maria Gorskikh,Sichao Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper examines whether to upgrade existing web infrastructure or create new registries for autonomous AI agents, highlighting critical failures in DNS, PKI, and addressing. It evaluates upgrade, switch, and hybrid approaches, favoring hybrids for balancing compatibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous AI agents demands infrastructure beyond current human-scale web systems, requiring millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and scalable addressing.

Method: The paper analyzes DNS, PKI, and addressing limitations, then evaluates three solutions: upgrading existing systems, switching to new architectures, or adopting hybrid registries.

Result: Upgrades offer compatibility but fall short of agent needs; clean-slate solutions perform better but take longer to adopt. Hybrid approaches, combining centralized and federated systems, are recommended.

Conclusion: Hybrid registries, blending centralized and federated designs, are the most viable solution to meet the qualitative demands of AI agent infrastructure.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

### [345] [Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11139)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: INRs are analyzed for their capacity and biases, showing grids often outperform them, except for lower-dimensional signals like shape contours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior of INRs compared to grid representations.

Method: Evaluated diverse INRs on 2D/3D signals with varying bandwidth, testing overfitting and generalization tasks like tomography and super-resolution.

Result: Grids with interpolation train faster and achieve higher quality than INRs for most tasks, but INRs excel with lower-dimensional signals.

Conclusion: INRs are best suited for signals with lower-dimensional structure, guiding their future application.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

### [346] [ADAgent: LLM Agent for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis with Collaborative Coordinator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11150)
*Wenlong Hou,Gangqian Yang,Ye Du,Yeung Lau,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Ling Long,Shujun Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ADAgent, an AI agent for Alzheimer's disease analysis, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by integrating multi-modal data and advanced tools, achieving higher accuracy in diagnosis and prognosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and precise diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is critical, but existing methods often rely on single-modality data or limited multi-modal approaches, lacking flexibility and integration.

Method: ADAgent is built on a large language model (LLM) and integrates a reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome coordinator to handle multi-modal or missing data for diverse AD-related tasks.

Result: ADAgent achieves significant improvements, including a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis accuracy, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: ADAgent demonstrates the potential of specialized AI agents in improving Alzheimer's disease analysis by leveraging multi-modal data and advanced integration methods.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VeTTA is a scalable framework using Transformer-based autoencoders to learn vector representations of 3D vascular networks, reducing GPU memory needs and improving reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model anatomical tree structures in medical imaging with precision, flexibility, and topological consistency.

Method: Two-stage Transformer-based autoencoders: Vessel Autoencoder for geometric details and Vessel Tree Autoencoder for topology, followed by recursive decoding.

Result: Superior reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic latent space interpolations on 2D/3D datasets.

Conclusion: VeTTA provides an efficient and scalable solution for modeling vascular networks in medical imaging.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

### [348] [DiffPR: Diffusion-Based Phase Reconstruction via Frequency-Decoupled Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11183)
*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffPR, a two-stage framework, addresses oversmoothing in QPI by decoupling frequency learning and using a diffusion model for high-frequency detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversmoothing and spectral bias in deep learning for QPI limit the representation of fine details, which are crucial for diagnostics.

Method: Stage 1: Asymmetric U-Net without high-frequency skips predicts low-frequency phase. Stage 2: Diffusion model refines high-frequency details.

Result: DiffPR outperforms U-Net baselines, improving PSNR by 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11%, with sharper details.

Conclusion: Cancelling high-level skips and using a diffusion model effectively mitigates spectral bias in phase-retrieval networks.

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

### [349] [Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283)
*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A transformer-based neural network improves cryo-EM image denoising by clustering, aligning, and denoising simultaneously, outperforming single-image DNNs by 45% in MSE at low SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs are limited in high-noise settings like cryo-EM. Leveraging redundancy in cryo-EM datasets, the paper aims to enhance denoising by combining clustering, alignment, and denoising.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based neural network that clusters, aligns, and denoises cryo-EM images simultaneously, extending traditional class averaging methods.

Result: Achieves a 45% reduction in relative MSE compared to single-image DNNs at an SNR of 0.03 on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The transformer-based architecture effectively integrates clustering, alignment, and denoising, offering superior performance in high-noise cryo-EM settings.

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning model (FAD-Net) using frequency-domain analysis improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality, and precise segmentation of coronary arteries from ICA is crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: FAD-Net integrates a frequency-domain attention mechanism (MLSA) and a cascading diffusion strategy (LFDM) to enhance segmentation accuracy by leveraging high- and low-frequency components.

Result: FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717 in segmentation and performs well in stenosis detection (TPR: 0.6140, PPV: 0.6398).

Conclusion: FAD-Net shows significant potential for improving CAD diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

TL;DR: A novel framework adapts Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution, outperforming existing methods by leveraging pre-trained models and text descriptions for high-quality imaging at reduced radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between image quality and patient safety in high-resolution CT imaging by overcoming challenges of deep learning methods with complex degradations and limited medical data.

Method: Uses a practical degradation model to synthesize low-quality images, a pre-trained vision-language model for descriptions, and Stable Diffusion with a controlling strategy for super-resolution.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, enabling high-quality CT imaging with reduced radiation doses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significant potential for improving CT imaging quality while minimizing radiation exposure, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel compression-driven dimensionality reduction method for video super-resolution (VSR) is proposed, improving efficiency and performance while reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVSR models suffer from slow inference, complex training, and reliance on auxiliary data, exacerbated by increasing video frame rates.

Method: Leverages structural similarities between hyperspectral images and video data, introducing a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy for efficiency.

Result: Achieves or surpasses SOTA performance with significantly reduced inference time.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, efficient solution for advancing VSR technology, with code publicly available.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

*Yifei Tang,Hongjie Jiang,Changhong Jing,Hieu Pham,Shuqiang Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned brain network model is proposed for brain disease diagnosis, enhancing generalizability by expanding brain region representations across multiple dimensions and leveraging self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for brain networks are limited to a single dimension, restricting their broader application in neuroscience.

Method: The model includes an adapter module for multi-dimensional feature expansion and a fine-tuned foundation model using self-supervised learning and transformer blocks to extract features and compute inter-region associations.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a promising approach for advancing brain network analysis research.

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

### [354] [Exploring the Effectiveness of Deep Features from Domain-Specific Foundation Models in Retinal Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11753)
*Zuzanna Skorniewska,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep generative models for synthetic medical imaging, focusing on retinal fundus images. It compares domain-specific deep features with perceptual and edge-detection losses, finding edge-detection more effective for vascular sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy, data scarcity, and bias in medical imaging limit neural network adoption. Synthetic data via generative models can address these issues but requires clinical accuracy, especially for retinal imaging.

Method: The study evaluates a distance-based loss function using deep activation layers of a foundational model against perceptual and edge-detection losses for generating synthetic retinal images.

Result: Domain-specific deep features did not improve image generation, but edge-detection filters enhanced vascular structure sharpness in synthetic samples.

Conclusion: Conventional edge-detection filters outperform domain-specific deep features for improving synthetic retinal image quality, particularly in vascular details.

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the

electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and

*Zhangkai Ni,Yang Zhang,Wenhan Yang,Hanli Wang,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image super-resolution, combining data-driven and model-driven approaches to improve performance while maintaining compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven super-resolution methods expand receptive fields but increase model complexity. Model-driven methods show promise in balancing performance and compactness, inspiring the SSIU approach.

Method: SSIU unfolds an optimization function with structural similarity constraints. It uses Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and Efficient Sparse Attention Modules (ESAM) iteratively, along with a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS).

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: SSIU effectively combines data-driven and model-driven strengths, offering a compact and efficient solution for image super-resolution.

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

TL;DR: MindGrab is a highly efficient deep fully-convolutional model for skull-stripping in head images, outperforming classical methods with fewer parameters and lower resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parameter- and memory-efficient model for volumetric skull-stripping that works across various imaging modalities without requiring high-end hardware.

Method: MindGrab uses a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions and was trained on modality-agnostic synthetic data. It was evaluated on 606 multimodal brain scans.

Result: Achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9, outperforming ROBEX and BET, and matched or surpassed SynthStrip in half the scenarios with 95% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MindGrab offers state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly lower resource demands, making it accessible on a wider range of hardware.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli
(https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The crossMoDA challenge series focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation for MRI, evolving to enhance clinical relevance. Findings show improved performance with expanded datasets but highlight challenges like declining cochlea Dice scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 MRI scans for cost-effective VS management, addressing domain shift challenges.

Method: Unsupervised cross-modality segmentation from ceT1 to T2 MRI, evolving from single-institutional data (2021) to multi-institutional and heterogeneous data (2023).

Result: Expanding datasets reduced outliers, but cochlea segmentation performance declined in 2023 due to added complexity. The 2023 winning approach improved performance even on homogeneous data.

Conclusion: While progress is noted, clinically acceptable VS segmentation requires further advancements. Future benchmarks may need more challenging cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

### [359] [Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11297)
*Jiaqi Wu,Jiahong Ouyang,Farshad Moradi,Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi,Greg Zaharchuk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for synthesizing PET images from MRI data in epilepsy patients, finding SGM-KD as the best for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all models perform well with low-dose PET inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimal radiation dose issue in FDG PET for epilepsy patients by synthesizing diagnostic-quality PET images from MRI or ultralow-dose PET using generative AI methods.

Method: Compared three models (SGM-KD, SGM-VP, Transformer-Unet) for MRI-to-PET translation in 52 subjects, evaluating standard and clinically relevant metrics like metabolic asymmetry.

Result: SGM-KD performed best for pure MRI-to-PET synthesis, while all models improved significantly with 1% low-dose PET inputs, achieving comparable quantitative and visual quality.

Conclusion: SGMs show promise for MRI-to-PET translation, and all tested models can accurately synthesize full-dose FDG-PET when combined with MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Pre-trained biological foundation models and chromatin accessibility data improve gRNA activity prediction for CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting gRNA activity is challenging due to limited data, PAM variation, and reliance on large-scale training.

Method: Uses embeddings from a pre-trained RNA foundation model and integrates chromatin accessibility data with a lightweight regressor.

Result: Substantial gains over traditional baselines, highlighting improved gRNA activity prediction.

Conclusion: Pre-trained foundation models and chromatin accessibility data are effective for enhancing gRNA activity estimation.

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity
prediction.

*Hiren Madhu,João Felipe Rocha,Tinglin Huang,Siddharth Viswanath,Smita Krishnaswamy,Rex Ying*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: HEIST is a hierarchical graph transformer model for spatial transcriptomics data, capturing gene regulation and spatial context to improve cell representation and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models ignore spatial resolution or gene regulatory information, missing hierarchical dependencies in gene regulation influenced by neighboring cells.

Method: HEIST uses hierarchical graph transformers to model tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs and cells as gene regulatory networks, pre-trained on 22.3M cells with contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding.

Result: HEIST effectively encodes microenvironmental influences, discovers spatially-informed subpopulations, and achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks like clinical outcome prediction and cell type annotation.

Conclusion: HEIST demonstrates the importance of hierarchical modeling and gene regulatory network-based representations for spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Implicit Neural Representations (INR) for high-resolution spatial mapping of gene expression in the human brain, focusing on Alzheimer's disease risk genes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sparsity of microarray gene expression data in the human brain and create detailed spatial maps at voxel-level resolution.

Method: Adapted INR models to process data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) and generate gene expression maps, using Abagen interpolations as a baseline.

Result: Produced robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of gene expression, specifically for Alzheimer's disease risk genes.

Conclusion: INR-based methods are effective for enhancing spatial transcriptomics data, enabling detailed analysis of gene expression patterns in the brain.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in
non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms,
specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool
for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray
gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a
voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes,
whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

*Roxana Zahedi,Ahmadreza Argha,Nona Farbehi,Ivan Bakhshayeshi,Youqiong Ye,Nigel H. Lovell,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: SemanticST is a graph-based deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics, improving data analysis by modeling cellular contexts and achieving scalable, interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial transcriptomics methods face challenges like noise, scalability, and inadequate modeling of cellular relationships. SemanticST addresses these by integrating biological insights into its design.

Method: SemanticST constructs multi-semantic graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue structure, using disentangled embeddings and an attention-based fusion strategy. It employs a community-aware min-cut loss for robustness.

Result: SemanticST outperforms existing methods (DeepST, GraphST, IRIS) with 20% gains in metrics like ARI and NMI. It identified rare, clinically significant niches in breast cancer data.

Conclusion: SemanticST offers a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded solution for spatial transcriptomics, enabling robust discovery and advancing precision medicine.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

*Barbara Oakley,Michael Johnston,Ken-Zen Chen,Eulho Jung,Terrence J. Sejnowski*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how over-reliance on AI tools like ChatGPT and calculators may weaken human memory systems, impacting expertise and critical thinking, and suggests the need for strong internal cognitive models for effective human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the paradox where advanced AI tools, while enhancing productivity, may impair human cognitive processes like memory consolidation and expertise development.

Method: The study draws on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, reviewing empirical evidence and parallels between AI phenomena (e.g., 'grokking') and human cognitive processes.

Result: Premature reliance on AI inhibits procedural memory and intuitive mastery, highlighting the need for robust internal cognitive models to guide AI use.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for policy changes in education and workforce training to balance AI use with the development of strong internal cognitive frameworks.

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Healthcare organizations should develop proprietary foundation models instead of relying on commercial ones due to domain-specific needs, data sovereignty, competitive advantages, and transformative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for healthcare organizations to leverage proprietary AI models to meet unique domain requirements, ensure data governance, and gain strategic advantages.

Method: The study analyzes empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and case studies to evaluate the benefits of proprietary multimodal foundation models.

Result: Proprietary models improve clinical performance, data governance, competitive positioning, and innovation speed.

Conclusion: Proprietary foundation models are essential for forward-thinking healthcare organizations, offering a framework for build-versus-buy decisions.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

TL;DR: Survey of AI researchers and the public on AI systems with subjective experience, revealing differing timelines and governance views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand perceptions and attitudes toward AI systems with subjective experience and their governance.

Method: Surveyed 582 AI researchers and 838 US participants on timelines, governance, and ethical treatment of such AI systems.

Result: Median estimates for AI with subjective experience: 1-5% by 2024, 25-30% by 2034, 60-70% by 2100. Public more skeptical (25% chance never) than researchers (10%). Support for safeguards but divided on rights.

Conclusion: Both groups see AI subjective experience as possible this century, but uncertainty and disagreement persist on timelines and governance.

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-tail driving scenarios in autonomous driving by leveraging scalable vision-language-trajectory (VLT) pretraining and lightweight RL fine-tuning.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) Self-supervised VLT next-token prediction on nominal and long-tail driving data, (2) Fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using preference-labeled frames.

Result: Poutine-Base achieves RFS 8.12 (close to expert ground-truth), and final Poutine model scores 7.99, winning the 2025 Waymo challenge.

Conclusion: Scalable VLT pretraining and lightweight RL fine-tuning enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving performance.

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

TL;DR: Gondola, a vision-language planning model using LLMs, improves robotic manipulation by leveraging multi-view images and history plans for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizing robotic manipulation across unseen objects, environments, and tasks with diverse language instructions.

Method: Gondola integrates multi-view images and history plans to generate actionable plans with interleaved texts and segmentation masks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on the GemBench dataset across all generalization levels.

Conclusion: Gondola demonstrates superior generalization in robotic manipulation, overcoming limitations of single-view inputs and imprecise object grounding.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

*Rongfei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving robotic precision in manufacturing by simulating multi-robot control for fastening tasks and optimizing camera placement to minimize image noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans outperform robots in high-precision tasks due to sensory cues. Robots face uncertainties like noise and model inaccuracy, requiring better control and camera placement.

Method: Proposes a multi-robot control system for fastening tasks and a novel algorithm for optimizing camera location to reduce image noise.

Result: The multi-robot system reduces uncertainties, and the camera algorithm finds optimal positions to minimize noise.

Conclusion: Combining control algorithms and optimized camera placement enhances robotic precision in manufacturing.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper identifies systematic non-optimal behaviors (sidetracks) in human demonstrations for robot learning, categorizing them into four types and analyzing their patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in treating suboptimal human demonstrations as random noise and improve Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms.

Method: Conducted a public space study with 40 participants, recreated the setup in simulation, and annotated demonstrations to identify sidetracks.

Result: Found four types of sidetracks (Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern, with their distribution tied to task context and interface.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to enhance LfD and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A survey on using foundation models (e.g., large language models, vision-language models) for generating and analyzing autonomous driving scenarios, covering taxonomy, methodologies, datasets, and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional scenario generation methods (e.g., lack of diversity, unrealistic cases) by leveraging foundation models for more robust and diverse autonomous driving testing.

Method: Conducts a survey, presenting a unified taxonomy of foundation models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models) and reviewing methodologies, datasets, simulation platforms, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of current approaches, tools, and challenges in using foundation models for scenario generation and analysis in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges and future research directions, with a maintained repository for ongoing updates and supplementary materials.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All
reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which
contains supplementary materials and is available at

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic
communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems
and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents.
RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples
client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range
of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based
orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport
layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured
operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features
such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace
isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and
security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and
adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with
deployment practices and applicability across industries including
manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient,
and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAIL enables faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies, achieving up to 4x speedup in simulation and 3.2x in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IL-trained policies are limited to demonstration speed, restricting task throughput, which is critical for applications like industrial automation.

Method: SAIL integrates four components: consistency-preserving action inference, high-fidelity motion tracking, adaptive speed modulation, and action scheduling.

Result: SAIL achieves up to 4x speedup in simulation and 3.2x in real-world tasks across 12 tasks.

Conclusion: SAIL effectively addresses the challenge of faster execution in IL, enhancing robotic task throughput.

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

### [374] [SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11309)
*Ziyi Zhang,Ziheng Jiang,Chengquan Jiang,Menghan Yu,Size Zheng,Haibin Lin,Henry Hoffmann,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwiftSpec introduces a system for ultra-low latency LLM decoding by redesigning speculative decoding asynchronously, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-latency decoding is critical for applications like chatbots, but existing methods struggle with inefficiencies in combining speculative decoding and tensor parallelism.

Method: SwiftSpec redesigns speculative decoding with asynchronous, disaggregated components, parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and optimized kernels.

Result: SwiftSpec achieves a 1.75x speedup over state-of-the-art systems and serves Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 GPUs.

Conclusion: SwiftSpec is the fastest known system for low-latency LLM serving, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

*Ahmed Farooq*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes an energy functional inspired by Modern Hopfield Networks, linking it to attention mechanisms in transformers, and introduces 'context wells' to model token relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify Modern Hopfield Networks and attention mechanisms, enhancing transformer models' ability to understand complex relationships and improve performance.

Method: Defines an energy landscape whose gradient corresponds to attention computation, with minima forming 'context wells' for stable token relationships.

Result: Non-linear attention mechanisms improve transformer models' representation learning, efficiency, and performance in sequence tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enables non-linear heads in transformers like BERT, offering richer representations for complex data.

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a practical algorithm for selecting high-quality datasets to minimize population loss in prediction models, with theoretical guarantees and demonstrated effectiveness in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI highlights the need for better dataset selection to improve machine learning models, yet this area remains underexplored.

Method: The study develops an algorithm using an oracle inequality and data-driven estimators to merge datasets effectively and reduce population loss.

Result: Numerical experiments show the algorithm's effectiveness in linear regression and broader machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully enhances predictive model performance by merging datasets, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

### [377] [Fast Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks with Partial Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11456)
*Poompol Buathong,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: An accelerated p-KGFN algorithm reduces computational overhead in Bayesian optimization of function networks while maintaining query efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks (e.g., manufacturing, drug discovery) with cost-aware partial evaluations.

Method: Proposes an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm using node-specific candidate inputs from a global Monte Carlo simulation to reduce overhead.

Result: Achieves up to a 16x speedup over original p-KGFN with modest loss in query efficiency.

Conclusion: The method balances computational efficiency and query performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

*Chloe H. Choi,Andrea Zanoni,Daniele E. Schiavazzi,Alison L. Marsden*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to reduce computational costs in Bayesian parameter estimation for cardiovascular modeling by leveraging low-fidelity approximations, validating five approaches on test cases and real-world examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of high-fidelity simulations make solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling challenging.

Method: Five methods are explored: surrogate models for high-fidelity simulations, discrepancy surrogates (using neural networks or dimensionality reduction), and treating discrepancy as noise with normalizing flows.

Result: Methods are validated on analytical test cases and applied to two cardiovascular examples, comparing accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The approaches effectively reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating practical utility in cardiovascular modeling.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

### [379] [Using Deep Operators to Create Spatio-temporal Surrogates for Dynamical Systems under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11761)
*Jichuan Tang,Patrick T. Brewick,Ryan G. McClarren,Christopher Sweet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces FExD, a variant of DeepONets, for accurate and efficient spatio-temporal surrogate modeling in structural dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SciML methods struggle with full spatial-temporal surrogate modeling for dynamical systems.

Method: Proposes FExD, enhancing branch and trunk networks of DeepONets for multi-output response predictions.

Result: FExD outperforms vanilla DeepONet and a modified Extended DeepONet in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: FExD advances operator learning for structural dynamics, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

### [380] [Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition: Is Random Grid Search Sufficient?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11831)
*Hwanwoo Kim,Chong Liu,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of inexact maximizers in Bayesian optimization (BO) acquisition functions, showing that sublinear regret is achievable under certain conditions. It also validates random grid search as an efficient solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BO often relies on computationally expensive exact maximization of acquisition functions. The study explores whether inexact solutions can still yield good performance.

Method: The authors analyze GP-UCB and GP-TS with inexact maximizers, defining a measure of inaccuracy and deriving regret bounds. Random grid search is proposed as a solver.

Result: Under certain conditions, inexact BO achieves sublinear cumulative regret. Random grid search is shown to be effective and efficient.

Conclusion: Inexact BO can perform well, and random grid search is a practical alternative to exact solvers, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

*Zhenisbek Assylbekov,Alan Legg,Artur Pak*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the EM algorithm's exponential convergence in overspecified Gaussian mixture models under specific structural conditions, with theoretical and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the EM algorithm's behavior in overspecified settings and improve practical applications like clustering and density estimation.

Method: Focuses on a structured configuration with component means at simplex vertices and non-degenerate weights, using strong convexity and Polyak-Łojasiewicz inequality for analysis.

Result: Exponential convergence in KL distance is proven, with O(log(1/ε)) iterations for ε-accuracy, supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insights and practical guidance for EM in overspecified models, enhancing convergence and initialization strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

*Michela Lapenna,Caterina De Bacco*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Comparison of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in link prediction, focusing on feature handling, robustness to noise, and heterophily. PGMs outperform GNNs in low-dimensional/noisy features and high heterophily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare how PGMs and GNNs capture information in networked datasets, addressing their differences in handling features and robustness.

Method: Conduct three experiments on synthetic and real networks: feature handling, robustness to noisy features, and heterophily impact. Also compare computational complexity and interpretability.

Result: PGMs outperform GNNs with low-dimensional/noisy features and in high heterophily scenarios. GNNs rely more on input features.

Conclusion: PGMs are more robust in certain real-world scenarios, while GNNs' performance depends heavily on feature quality. Both frameworks have trade-offs in complexity and interpretability.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

*Siavash Ameli,Chris van der Heide,Liam Hodgkinson,Michael W. Mahoney*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'free decompression,' a novel method to estimate eigenvalues of very large, 'impalpable' matrices using principles from free probability theory, even when direct access to the matrix is restricted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets make forming or accessing full matrices impractical, and existing methods relying on matrix-vector products may not be feasible when only small submatrices are available.

Method: The method leverages free probability theory to extrapolate the spectrum of large matrices from empirical spectral densities of small submatrices.

Result: The approach effectively estimates eigenspectra of impalpable matrices, validated against synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Free decompression provides a viable solution for spectral estimation in scenarios where traditional methods fail due to matrix inaccessibility.

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a layered framework for human-agent collaboration, focusing on interaction, process, and infrastructure to address fragmentation in current AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools assist with isolated tasks but lack sustained, adaptive collaboration, prompting the need for a unified architecture.

Method: A layered framework integrating interaction, process, and infrastructure, with an emphasis on making processes explicit, inspectable, and adaptable.

Result: The model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI builders.

Conclusion: The framework reimagines human-agent collaboration as a coherent, aligned system for real-world work, beyond task-specific augmentation.

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

TL;DR: The paper reviews avatar realism in VR teacher training, proposing a 'Graduated Realism' framework and 'Crazy Slots' architecture to balance pedagogical needs with technological feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between the push for hyper-realistic avatars and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning in VR teacher training.

Method: Systematic literature review and application of learning theories (e.g., Cognitive Load Theory) to propose a new framework and computational architecture.

Result: Hyper-realism isn't always optimal; a scaffolded approach (Graduated Realism) and efficient architecture (Crazy Slots) are proposed.

Conclusion: Pedagogically grounded realism is key for scalable, effective VR teacher training tools.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

TL;DR: A digital hardware architecture for real-time neural network training is presented, optimized for high-throughput data, with FPGA proof-of-concept showing scalability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional filtering struggles with dynamic data; machine learning near detectors offers a better alternative.

Method: Implementation-independent hardware architecture for neural network training, analyzed for performance and trade-offs.

Result: FPGA implementation confirms accuracy, with current FPGAs supporting ~3,500 neurons per chip.

Conclusion: The architecture advances real-time, extreme-edge learning integration in detector systems.

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,

*Md Mynoddin,Troyee Dev,Rishita Chakma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Brain2Vec, a hybrid deep learning model combining CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanisms, classifies stress from EEG signals with 81.25% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental stress impacts cognitive health, requiring non-invasive diagnostic tools. EEG signals offer neural insights but are challenging to model due to their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature.

Method: Brain2Vec uses CNN layers for spatial dependencies, LSTM for temporal patterns, and attention mechanisms to highlight key regions. Preprocessing includes bandpass filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation.

Result: Achieves 0.68 AUC and 81.25% validation accuracy on the DEAP dataset, surpassing CNN-LSTM baselines.

Conclusion: Brain2Vec shows promise for wearable stress monitoring and personalized healthcare systems.

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed RNN, improves state estimation in stochastic systems with non-Gaussian noise, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often deviate from the assumptions of the Kalman filter (linearity, Gaussian noise), necessitating data-driven alternatives.

Method: Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) informed by the Kalman filter, propagating error covariance via Joseph's formula and optimizing Gaussian negative log-likelihood.

Result: Outperforms the conventional Kalman filter and a state-of-the-art deep learning estimator in non-Gaussian noise conditions.

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet offers a robust solution for accurate state estimation with reliable error covariance in complex, noisy environments.

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Conclusion: The method improves clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG monitoring, supporting advancements in clinical and wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method

TL;DR: A real-world lane-change prediction system using Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Bayesian inference, validated on hardware, predicts maneuvers 3-4 seconds early for safer reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment in lane-change prediction research.

Method: Combines a perception module (sensing and feature conversion) with a pretrained prediction module (KGEs and Bayesian inference) to trigger braking actions.

Result: Predicts lane changes 3-4 seconds in advance, enabling safe reactions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective real-world deployment of lane-change prediction, enhancing safety.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGAs like Versal ACAP face memory bandwidth limitations, hindering AI Engine utilization. DPUV4E aims to address this by optimizing data flow and resource usage.

Method: Designs Conv PE and DWC PE units for efficient computation, leverages data reuse, and extends PE functionality to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional tasks.

Result: Achieves 8.6× TOPS/W efficiency, reduces DSP usage by 95.8%, LUT usage by 44.7%, and latency by 68.5%. Improves throughput by up to 2.2× for depth-wise convolution models.

Conclusion: DPUV4E significantly enhances FPGA-based CNN acceleration, balancing performance and resource efficiency for Versal ACAP.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) strategy for reducing AI workload carbon emissions, showing it cuts emissions by up to 14.6% while maintaining training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scientific evidence on FtS's effectiveness in reducing AI's carbon footprint.

Method: Benchmarked four AI anomaly detection algorithms under four strategies (no strategy, FtS, Flexible Start, Pause and Resume) using 2021 carbon intensity data from seven European cities.

Result: FtS reduced carbon emissions by up to 14.6% (peaking at 16.3%) without compromising training time.

Conclusion: FtS is a viable strategy for lowering AI's carbon footprint while preserving computational efficiency.

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated testing lacks human-level reliability and struggles with test locality and business logic blindness.

Method: Translate Scala code into Lean representations, generate theorems for API/database behavior, and verify them using LLM-based provers.

Result: Formally verifies 50% of test requirements, costing $2.19 per API, proving scalability and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for scalable, AI-powered testing, enhancing productivity as models improve.

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based code translation lacks trustworthiness; ensuring semantic equivalence between legacy and modern code is critical.

Method: Symbolic-execution-based test generation for COBOL, mocking external calls, and generating equivalent JUnit tests for Java.

Result: Automated validation of semantic equivalence and potential code repair, with feedback to improve the LLM.

Conclusion: The framework enhances trust in LLM-based translations and aids in refining the translation process.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

Result: The framework is shown feasible for near-term implementation using existing evaluation tools and testing practices.

Conclusion: The structured approach aids military decision-makers in ensuring AI systems meet performance, transparency, and human integration standards for confident deployment.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat

that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness

safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term

Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in embedded system development, a domain lacking comprehensive benchmarks.

Method: Introduces EmbedAgent for role simulation and Embedbench, a benchmark with 126 cases across 9 components and 3 platforms, tested on 10 LLMs.

Result: LLMs show varied performance, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring 55.6% pass@1 with schematics and 50.0% without. Strategies like retrieval augmented generation improve results.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' limitations in embedded tasks and demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted strategies for performance enhancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or

multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

*Chaitanya Ravuri,Saman Amarasinghe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Functional clustering reduces hallucination-induced errors in code-generation LLMs by clustering candidate programs based on identical I/O behavior, providing a tunable confidence score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern code-generation LLMs often produce subtle bugs, making their outputs unsafe for autonomous deployment.

Method: The method samples multiple candidate programs, executes them on self-generated test suites, and clusters those with identical I/O behavior. The largest cluster's empirical mass serves as a confidence estimate.

Result: On LiveCodeBench, the verifier reduces error rates from ~65% to 2%, and to 0% at a conservative threshold while maintaining 15.6% coverage.

Conclusion: Functional clustering offers a practical solution for dependable, autonomous code generation, applicable to closed-source APIs and future models.

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github

### [403] [Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation -- A Systematic Analysis of the Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11022)
*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Iterative LLM feedback for code generation increases security vulnerabilities by 37.6% in 5 iterations, challenging the assumption of improved security. Human validation is crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how security vulnerabilities evolve in AI-generated code through iterative LLM feedback, addressing a gap in current research.

Method: A controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of improvements using four distinct prompting strategies.

Result: A 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after five iterations, with distinct patterns across prompting approaches.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM refinement does not inherently improve code security; human expertise and validation are essential to mitigate risks.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

*Ziga Kovacic,Celine Lee,Justin Chiu,Wenting Zhao,Kevin Ellis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Librarian, a method for refactoring code into reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark for evaluating code agents. Librarian outperforms state-of-the-art agents in compression and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of refactoring specialized code into reusable components, especially as code agents improve at solving isolated problems.

Method: Librarian uses a sample-and-rerank approach to generate reusable libraries. Minicode serves as a benchmark for evaluating refactoring performance.

Result: Librarian achieves 1.6-2x better compression rates and improved correctness compared to other code agents.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of code agents in refactoring for reusability, with Librarian and Minicode providing tools for future research.

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code Researcher, a deep research agent for systems code, outperforms baselines by deeply exploring codebases and using multi-step reasoning to generate patches for crashes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLM-based coding agents on systems code is underexplored due to the complexity and size of such codebases.

Method: Code Researcher performs multi-step reasoning about code semantics, patterns, and commit history, storing context in structured memory to synthesize patches.

Result: Achieves a 58% crash-resolution rate on Linux kernel crashes (vs. 37.5% by SWE-agent) and explores more files per trajectory (10 vs. 1.33).

Conclusion: Global context gathering and multi-faceted reasoning are crucial for handling large codebases, as demonstrated by Code Researcher's success.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

*Jiahui Geng,Fengyu Cai,Shaobo Cui,Qing Li,Liangwei Chen,Chenyang Lyu,Haonan Li,Derui Zhu,Walter Pretschner,Heinz Koeppl,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoQuIR is a new benchmark for quality-aware code retrieval, evaluating correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. It tests 23 models, revealing gaps in recognizing code quality, and proposes training methods to improve quality awareness without losing semantic relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on functional relevance but ignore software quality dimensions, creating a gap in evaluating code retrieval systems.

Method: Introduces CoQuIR, a multilingual benchmark with quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets. Uses two new metrics and benchmarks 23 retrieval models. Proposes training methods using synthetic datasets.

Result: Top models often fail to distinguish low-quality code. Training methods improve quality-aware metrics without compromising semantic relevance. Downstream code generation validates the approach.

Conclusion: Integrating quality signals into code retrieval is crucial for trustworthy software tools. CoQuIR sets a foundation for future improvements.

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing Lean 4 ecosystem makes it challenging to navigate its extensive libraries, necessitating a tool for efficient semantic search.

Method: LeanExplore combines a multi-source semantic embedding model, BM25+ for lexical relevance, and PageRank for declaration importance. It offers a website, Python API, and self-hosting options.

Result: The search engine supports semantic and keyword-based searches, integrates with LLMs via MCP, and enhances Lean 4 workflows and AI-driven research.

Conclusion: LeanExplore improves accessibility and usability of Lean 4 libraries, aiding both human users and AI-driven theorem proving.

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,
data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows

*Weibo Gao,Qi Liu,Rui Li,Yuze Zhao,Hao Wang,Linan Yre,Fangzhou Yao,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Coda enhances PKT models by mitigating noise in programming activities, improving accuracy through code graphs and cluster-aware GCNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PKT models overlook noise in long-term programming activities, limiting performance. Coda addresses this by identifying and reducing noise impact.

Method: Coda transforms code sequences into code graphs, uses semantic similarity to filter noise, applies cluster-aware GCNs, and integrates an adaptor with noise constraints.

Result: Coda outperforms baselines on four datasets, effectively handling noisy programming records.

Conclusion: Coda is a model-agnostic framework that improves PKT by addressing noise, enhancing personalized programming education.

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

*Hanxi Guo,Siyuan Cheng,Kaiyuan Zhang,Guangyu Shen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMirage is a benchmark for detecting AI-generated code, covering 10 languages and outputs from 10 LLMs, revealing strengths and weaknesses of current detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of AI-generated code poses risks like plagiarism and security flaws, necessitating robust detection tools. Existing benchmarks are limited.

Method: CodeMirage spans 10 languages, includes original/paraphrased code, and uses outputs from 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Evaluates 10 detectors under realistic conditions.

Result: Nine key findings highlight detector strengths/weaknesses, identifying challenges for future work.

Conclusion: CodeMirage provides a rigorous testbed for advancing AI-generated code detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOTO, a framework for efficient vulnerability detection by fusing multiple models without joint training, reducing resource needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and diversity of software ecosystems make manual vulnerability detection impractical, and existing deep learning methods are resource-intensive.

Method: YOTO integrates multiple vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, avoiding joint training.

Result: YOTO enables rapid adaptation to new vulnerabilities with reduced time and computational costs.

Conclusion: YOTO offers a scalable and efficient solution for modern vulnerability detection challenges.

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge method for validating and refining Bash code generation in IT Automation, achieving high accuracy and significant improvements in code refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve code quality and model selection for automatic incident remediation by ensuring syntactical, semantic, and functional correctness of generated code.

Method: Proposes bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for LLM-as-a-Judge, validated against execution-based evaluation. Also introduces Reflection code agents for feedback-driven refinement.

Result: High accuracy (up to 8% over baseline) and agreement with execution-based evaluation. Reflection agents improved accuracy by up to 24%.

Conclusion: The enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge method and Reflection agents effectively validate and refine code, offering a robust solution for IT Automation.

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose system functionality to LLMs, eliminating the need for manual semantic modeling, and demonstrates its feasibility in a manufacturing setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for modeling capabilities and skills are labor-intensive and not LLM-friendly, prompting the need for a more accessible approach.

Method: The authors introduce MCP, a standardized interface for exposing system functionality to LLMs, and test it on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system.

Result: A general-purpose LLM successfully plans and executes a multi-step process using MCP, showing potential for flexible automation without semantic models.

Conclusion: MCP enables LLM-driven automation without explicit semantic models, paving the way for further research in tool integration for production systems.

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores converting NL2SQL datasets into NL2API datasets to study LLMs' performance in tool-calling tasks, revealing low task completion rates and highlighting the need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying LLMs as agentic systems interacting with large, complex API collections, the study aims to create datasets mimicking such environments.

Method: A novel data generation pipeline converts SQL queries into functionally equivalent API sequences, applied to the BIRD-SQL dataset to create over 2500 APIs. Natural language queries are paired with API sequences for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 10 LLMs shows low task completion rates (7-47%), marginally improving to 50% with ReACT agents. Models struggle with intent detection, sequencing, and slot-filling.

Conclusion: Current LLMs underperform in tool-calling tasks, indicating significant room for improvement. SQL exploitation remains better than API handling, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation, addressing functional equivalence issues and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of parallel programming and data scarcity in machine learning-based translation necessitate automated solutions ensuring functional equivalence.

Method: MSL uses a Translator and Tester in an iterative loop (Co-verify and Co-evolve) to mutually improve performance and generate functionally equivalent code.

Result: MSL improves Pass@1 by 28.91%, Tester performance by 68.90%, and surpasses CodeRosetta in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, matching DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: MSL effectively addresses functional equivalence in sequential-to-parallel translation, demonstrating superior performance and potential for practical adoption.

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in competitive programming but still lag in nuanced reasoning and complex problems, as shown by LiveCodeBench Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the claim that LLMs surpass elite humans in competitive programming by comparing their performance with expert humans.

Method: Introduces LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark with updated problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI, annotated by Olympiad medalists. Analyzes model submissions line-by-line.

Result: Best model achieves 53% pass@1 on medium problems and 0% on hard ones, excelling in implementation but failing in nuanced reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs' high performance is driven by implementation and tools, not reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro highlights gaps and guides future improvements.

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: ReVeal is a multi-turn RL framework combining code generation with self-verification and tool-based evaluation, improving LLM reasoning and verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs lack realistic verification signals and explicit optimization, leading to unreliable self-verification.

Method: ReVeal interleaves code generation with self-verification, uses external tools for feedback, and employs a customized RL algorithm with dense rewards.

Result: ReVeal significantly improves Pass@k on LiveCodeBench and outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B with deeper inference.

Conclusion: ReVeal is a scalable and effective paradigm for robust and autonomous AI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome

language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

### [418] [Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559)
*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct unit tests for vulnerability mitigation 66.5% of the time, though semantic correctness is harder to validate. It aids in partially automating test generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual test creation is resource-intensive; automating it with GPT-4 could improve efficiency in identifying and fixing software vulnerabilities.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4's ability to generate unit tests using the VUL4J dataset, focusing on code contexts, self-correction, and usability.

Result: GPT-4 produced syntactically correct tests 66.5% of the time, but semantic correctness was validated in only 7.5% of cases. Subjective usability was high.

Conclusion: GPT-4 is effective for generating vulnerability-witnessing tests, though manual refinement is still needed.

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

*Gábor Antal,Bence Bogenfürst,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GPT-4o underperforms GPT-4 in vulnerability repair but fixes more distinct issues. CVE info boosts repair rates, and combining it with manual code context yields the best results. Ensemble prompts improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-4o's effectiveness in automated vulnerability repair (AVR) for Java, comparing it to GPT-4 and exploring the impact of contextual information like CWE/CVE.

Method: Tested GPT-4o on 42 Java vulnerabilities from Vul4J using identical and custom prompts (including CWE/CVE details and code context). Each prompt was run three times, and fixes were validated with Vul4J's framework.

Result: GPT-4o fixed 10.5% more distinct vulnerabilities than GPT-4 but was 11.9% worse on average. CVE info improved repairs, and ensemble prompts achieved 62% success.

Conclusion: Ensemble prompts and contextual info (especially CVE + code context) enhance GPT-4o's AVR performance, making it viable for zero-shot vulnerability repair.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

### [420] [Anti-Aliased 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11252)
*Mae Younes,Adnane Boukhayma*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AA-2DGS improves 2D Gaussian Splatting by addressing aliasing artifacts with frequency constraints and a novel Mip filter, enhancing rendering quality across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS suffers from aliasing artifacts at varying sampling rates, limiting its practical use in scenarios like camera zoom.

Method: Introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel and an object space Mip filter to constrain frequency content and apply anti-aliasing.

Result: AA-2DGS eliminates high-frequency artifacts and maintains geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: AA-2DGS enhances 2DGS's rendering quality, making it more versatile for practical applications.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A new video quality dataset and metric (CGVQM) for synthetic content and modern rendering artifacts, outperforming existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets and metrics inadequately address synthetic content and modern rendering distortions.

Method: Created a dataset with advanced rendering distortions and proposed CGVQM, leveraging pre-trained 3D CNNs for quality assessment.

Result: CGVQM outperforms existing metrics (max Pearson correlation: 0.78) and aligns with human perception.

Conclusion: CGVQM and the dataset advance quality assessment for synthetic content, with open-source availability.

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

*Mohammadamin Moradi,Runyu Jiang,Yingzi Liu,Malvern Madondo,Tianming Wu,James J. Sohn,Xiaofeng Yang,Yasmin Hasan,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: An automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework using reinforcement learning and dose-based optimization improves consistency and efficiency in cervical cancer treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual treatment planning for HDR brachytherapy is expertise-dependent, leading to variability. Automation aims to enhance consistency and efficiency.

Method: A two-stage framework: RL agent selects treatment parameters, and an optimizer computes dwell times. Uses DVH metrics and clinical constraints.

Result: Achieved 93.89% average score, outperforming clinical plans (91.86%), with maintained target coverage and reduced hot spots.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates planning, improving outcomes and consistency in complex cases.

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

### [423] [PMF-CEC: Phoneme-augmented Multimodal Fusion for Context-aware ASR Error Correction with Error-specific Selective Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11064)
*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMF-CEC, a phoneme-augmented multimodal fusion method, to improve rare word recognition in ASR by addressing homophone confusion and overdetection issues in the prior ED-CEC method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR models struggle with rare words, especially homophones, and the prior ED-CEC method has limitations in accuracy and overdetection.

Method: PMF-CEC enhances ED-CEC by incorporating phoneme information and a retention probability mechanism to filter low-confidence edits.

Result: PMF-CEC reduces biased word error rates, outperforms ED-CEC and other contextual biasing methods, and maintains fast inference.

Conclusion: PMF-CEC is effective for rare word correction, especially homophones, and offers faster inference and robustness compared to LLM-based methods.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

TL;DR: Regularized FL techniques improve dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, outperforming FedAvg with significant WER reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of data scarcity, imbalance, and speaker heterogeneity in privacy-preserving FL for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition.

Method: Systematic investigation of three FL regularization techniques: parameter-based, embedding-based, and novel loss-based.

Result: Regularized FL outperforms FedAvg with up to 0.55% absolute WER reduction; higher communication frequency nears centralized performance.

Conclusion: Regularized FL is effective for privacy-preserving dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, with performance close to centralized training.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) to anticipate road surfaces,
support adaptive learning for active road noise cancellation, and generate
valuable insights for urban planning. The results of this study were
specifically captured to support a compelling business case for next-generation
automotive systems. This forward-looking approach not only promises to redefine
passenger comfort and improve vehicle safety, but also paves the way for
intelligent, data-driven urban road management, making the future of mobility
both achievable and sustainable.

Motivation: To support teachers by automating reading aloud evaluation, addressing limited research in this area.

Method: Leveraged Whisper and instruction-tuned LLMs with prompts for better transcriptions and mistake detection in child speech.

Result: Achieved 5.1% WER (improved from 9.4%) and increased F1 score for mistake detection from 0.39 to 0.73.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, setting a new benchmark for child read speech recognition and mistake detection.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on
reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel
multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without
prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition
performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,
improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved
reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the quality and intelligibility of TTS models when processing MX, as this area lacks thorough evaluation.

Method: Conducted listening and transcribing tests on five TTS models using LLMs to convert LaTeX MX to English pronunciation, measured via Mean Opinion Score and transcription correctness metrics.

Result: TTS models' outputs for MX are often unintelligible, with performance varying by model and MX category, and generally inferior to expert renditions. LLM choice had minimal impact.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improving TTS models to better handle MX, as current performance is inadequate.

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

TL;DR: A unified multi-ASR prompt-driven framework using LLMs for postprocessing improves transcription accuracy and semi-supervised ASR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pseudo-label generation for ASR involves complex pipelines with error propagation and disjoint optimization, motivating a simpler, unified approach.

Method: Proposes a multi-ASR prompt-driven framework with LLM postprocessing (textual or speech-based) to replace voting/arbitration logic. Compares architectures with/without LLMs.

Result: Significant improvements in transcription accuracy and semi-supervised ASR performance compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The unified framework with LLM postprocessing outperforms traditional pseudo-label generation methods, enhancing ASR model training.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of speech features from OpenSMILE and Praat for adolescents with autism, highlighting tool variability and its impact on model fairness and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about reproducibility and fairness in machine learning models due to unvalidated speech processing tools in diverse contexts.

Method: Evaluation of speech features extracted from OpenSMILE and Praat for adolescents with autism.

Result: Significant variation in features across tools, affecting model performance across contexts and demographics.

Conclusion: Domain-relevant verification is needed to improve reliability and fairness in clinical machine learning applications.

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Motivation: To address obstacles in transforming naturalistic child speech data into usable information for speech sciences.

Method: Summarizes three years of experiments on Voice Type Classification, testing representation features, architecture, and parameter search.

Result: Marginal performance gains from technical improvements; greater progress from focusing on data relevance, quantity, and sharing permissions.

Conclusion: Data collection with appropriate permissions and relevance is more impactful than technological advancements alone.

Abstract: Recordings gathered with child-worn devices promised to revolutionize both
fundamental and applied speech sciences by allowing the effortless capture of
children's naturalistic speech environment and language production. This
promise hinges on speech technologies that can transform the sheer mounds of
data thus collected into usable information. This paper demonstrates several
obstacles blocking progress by summarizing three years' worth of experiments
aimed at improving one fundamental task: Voice Type Classification. Our
experiments suggest that improvements in representation features, architecture,

Motivation: To address the challenges of analyzing large volumes of child audio data with minimal bias, ensuring high validity and accuracy in automated annotations.

Method: Summarizes existing resources, identifies error sources, and proposes troubleshooting metrics and practical strategies for researchers.

Result: Highlights the limitations of fully automated quality control but offers actionable solutions to improve data collection and analysis.

Conclusion: While full automation is unfeasible, practical strategies can enhance data quality and contextual interpretation in child language research.

Abstract: Audio-recordings collected with a child-worn device are a fundamental tool in
child language research. Long-form recordings collected over whole days promise
to capture children's input and production with minimal observer bias, and
therefore high validity. The sheer volume of resulting data necessitates
automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians.
This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry
points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that
threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of
resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting
metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers

*Simone Brivio,Nicola Rares Franco*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes symmetric autoencoders, a class of deep learning architectures, providing theoretical insights and introducing the EYS initialization strategy based on SVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of deep autoencoders, their theoretical foundation is lacking compared to classical methods. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The study introduces a formal classification of symmetric autoencoders and analyzes their properties mathematically, leveraging the EYS theorem. It also proposes the EYS initialization strategy.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders can be understood via the EYS theorem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed initialization strategy.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of symmetric autoencoders and demonstrates the effectiveness of the EYS initialization strategy.

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

### [434] [Decoding Cortical Microcircuits: A Generative Model for Latent Space Exploration and Controlled Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11062)
*Xingyu Liu,Yubin Li,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative model to uncover a low-dimensional blueprint guiding brain development, successfully compressing neural circuit structures into a latent space and enabling controllable generation of synthetic microcircuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the compact, low-dimensional blueprint that guides the brain's complex structure despite limited genetic instructions.

Method: A generative model is used to learn an underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits, capturing structural information in a compressed latent space.

Result: The model identifies interpretable directions in the latent space related to network properties and enables controllable generation of synthetic microcircuits with desired features.

Conclusion: This work provides a new approach to study neural circuit design principles and explore structure-function relationships, potentially advancing artificial neural networks.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

### [435] [Sparse Autoencoders Bridge The Deep Learning Model and The Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11123)

TL;DR: SAE-BrainMap aligns deep learning visual models with fMRI responses using sparse autoencoders, revealing strong correlations and hierarchical mapping between model layers and the human visual pathway.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge deep neural networks and the human visual cortex without relying on downstream tasks, enhancing model interpretability.

Method: Train layer-wise sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on model activations, correlate SAE unit activations with fMRI signals, and construct a voxel dictionary for hierarchical mapping.

Result: Strong activation correspondence (similarity up to 0.76), preservation of functional ROI structure, and visualization of dynamic visual information transformation in models.

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap provides a direct, task-free link between deep learning models and the human visual cortex, advancing interpretability insights.

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A novel 4D Swin Transformer model predicts future resting brain states from fMRI data with high accuracy, resembling BOLD dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience and mental health, and predicting brain states can reduce fMRI scan time and aid brain-computer interfaces.

Method: Proposes a 4D Swin Transformer encoder and convolutional decoder to learn spatio-temporal fMRI data, tested on 100 HCP subjects.

Result: The model accurately predicts 7.2s resting-state brain activities from prior 23.04s fMRI data, matching BOLD contrast and dynamics.

Conclusion: The Swin Transformer can learn high-resolution brain spatiotemporal organization, offering potential for reduced scan time and future brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

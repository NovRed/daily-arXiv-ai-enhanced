### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V2-VLNCE, a generalized scenario for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), and proposes VIL (View Invariant Learning) to enhance navigation policy robustness against viewpoint changes. VIL uses contrastive learning and a teacher-student framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes (camera height and angle variations), limiting their robustness. The paper aims to address this by proposing a view-invariant learning strategy.

Method: VIL employs contrastive learning for sparse, view-invariant features and a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module. It uses end-to-end training to optimize components jointly.

Result: VIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 8-15% in Success Rate on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets. It also improves performance in standard VLNCE settings and achieves top results on RxR-CE.

Conclusion: VIL enhances robustness to viewpoint changes without degrading standard performance, serving as an effective plug-and-play post-training method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel forensic ML technique detects deepfake videos by analyzing unnatural facial biometric patterns, tested across diverse datasets and unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake videos, used for fraud and disinformation, require reliable detection methods to combat misuse.

Method: Leverages unnatural facial biometric patterns for detection, evaluated on a large dataset of deepfakes and tested for reliability and generalization.

Result: Technique shows promise in detecting deepfakes, including resilience to video laundering and adaptability to new generators.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust solution for identifying deepfake impersonations, aiding in combating fraud and disinformation.

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a data-free, task-agnostic method to mitigate bias in vision-language models (VLMs) without predefined categories or external data. It uses an LLM to generate biased scene descriptions and a contrastive-style loss to debias embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP often amplify biases from training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM aims to address this without relying on external data or predefined bias categories.

Method: PRISM operates in two stages: (1) an LLM generates biased scene descriptions from class prompts, and (2) a novel contrastive-style debiasing loss learns a projection to minimize spurious correlations while preserving image-text alignment.

Result: PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on Waterbirds and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively mitigates bias in VLMs without external data or predefined categories, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMR-ViT combines temporal and kinematic data for human mesh recovery, using a Vision Transformer and CRM for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods use either temporal or kinematic data, but not both, limiting accuracy.

Method: Constructs a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image with CRM for spatial feature alignment, processes it with Vision Transformer, and regresses SMPL parameters.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets.

Conclusion: HMR-ViT effectively integrates both temporal and kinematic information for better human mesh recovery.

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining NeRF and MPM to estimate granular material properties from visual data, achieving accurate friction angle estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer material properties like friction angle from visual observations where direct measurement is impractical.

Method: Uses synthetic data from MPM simulations, NeRF for 3D reconstruction, and Bayesian optimization to minimize image loss for parameter estimation.

Result: Friction angle estimated with less than 2 degrees error, proving the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for real-world scenarios where direct material property measurement is challenging.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a visual analytics framework designed to improve the quality of FM-generated labels for multi-modal models by integrating multi-phased validation and human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for validating FM-generated labels focus on quantity over quality, lacking comprehensive metrics or scalable human validation.

Method: VISTA combines multi-phased data validation strategies with human expertise to identify and correct issues in FM-generated labels.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through use cases on benchmark datasets and expert reviews, showing improvements in label quality.

Conclusion: VISTA addresses the challenge of validating FM-generated labels, enhancing data quality and downstream model performance.

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces contrastive loss functions to improve diversity in tail class images for class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, without affecting head class performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mode collapse and diversity loss in tail classes due to imbalanced training data in class-conditional image synthesis.

Method: Two contrastive loss functions: (1) unsupervised InfoNCE loss for dissimilarity among synthetic tail class images, and (2) MSE loss contrasting conditional and unconditional generation at large timesteps to share knowledge from head classes.

Result: The framework outperforms standard DDPM and alternatives on datasets like CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning effectively enhances diversity for tail classes in imbalanced diffusion models, with simple implementation and strong performance.

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

### [9] [Infinite Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09068)
*Dell Zhang,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Mengxi Jia,Changzhi Sun,Ruilong Ren,Jingren Liu,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Infinite Video Understanding' as the next frontier for AI, addressing challenges in processing long-duration videos and suggesting key research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with computational and memory constraints for long videos, and maintaining temporal coherence and fine-grained details.

Method: The paper outlines core challenges and research directions, including streaming architectures, persistent memory, and event-centric reasoning.

Result: The concept of Infinite Video Understanding is introduced as a transformative goal for multimedia and AI research.

Conclusion: Framing Infinite Video Understanding as a research objective can drive innovation in AI and multimedia, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight optimizes VLM inference by leveraging sparse attention patterns, reducing FLOPs by 32%-41% with minimal accuracy impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) face inefficiencies due to expanded prompt lengths and quadratic attention complexity.

Method: Analyzes attention patterns in VLMs, identifies sparse categories (sink-only, document mask, hybrid), and proposes BlindSight, a training-free approach using input template-aware sparsity masks.

Result: Reduces FLOPs by 32%-41% with -2%-+2% accuracy change in multi-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: BlindSight effectively mitigates VLM inference bottlenecks without retraining.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

### [11] [From Physics to Foundation Models: A Review of AI-Driven Quantitative Remote Sensing Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09081)
*Zhenyu Yu,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Hua Wang,Pei Wang,Junyi Chen,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews the evolution of remote sensing inversion methods from physics-based models to data-driven and foundation model approaches, highlighting recent advances and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the shift from traditional physics-based methods to modern data-driven and foundation model techniques in remote sensing inversion.

Method: Review and comparison of methodologies, including physical models (e.g., PROSPECT), machine learning (e.g., deep learning), and foundation models (e.g., SatMAE).

Result: Identifies strengths and limitations of each paradigm, emphasizing advances in self-supervised pretraining and multi-modal integration.

Conclusion: Envisions next-generation foundation models with unified modeling, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

### [12] [Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082)
*Seungwoo Kim,Khai Loong Aw,Klemen Kotar,Cristobal Eyzaguirre,Wanhee Lee,Yunong Liu,Jared Watrous,Stefan Stojanov,Juan Carlos Niebles,Jiajun Wu,Daniel L. K. Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot method to extract optical flow from videos using frozen self-supervised video models, outperforming state-of-the-art models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical flow extraction is a core computer vision problem, but labels are scarce and synthetic datasets have a sim-to-real gap. The authors explore whether frozen video models can be prompted to output flow without fine-tuning.

Method: Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, the authors inject tracer perturbations into a next-frame predictor and track propagation. They identify key model properties for success and propose KL-tracing, a test-time procedure using Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: The method achieves a 16.6% relative improvement on TAP-Vid DAVIS and 4.7% on TAP-Vid Kubric, outperforming state-of-the-art models without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Counterfactual prompting of generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow extraction.

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MI CAM, a post-hoc visual explanation method for CNNs, using mutual information to weigh feature maps and generate saliency visualizations, validated by counterfactual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent and causal interpretations of CNN inferences, addressing the need for understanding internal mechanisms in critical applications like healthcare and automated power plants.

Method: MI CAM weighs feature maps by their mutual information with the input image, combining them linearly to produce saliency visualizations, validated via counterfactual analysis.

Result: MI CAM matches state-of-the-art methods and outperforms some in qualitative and quantitative measures, offering unbiased justifications for model inferences.

Conclusion: MI CAM is an effective visual explanation method for CNNs, providing causal and unbiased interpretations, with performance on par or better than existing approaches.

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo integrates radiologists' eye-gaze videos into LVLMs, improving CXR analysis by capturing temporal and spatial gaze dynamics, boosting performance in report generation and diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the sequential order of radiologists' eye movements, missing valuable insights. RadEyeVideo aims to leverage this for better human-computer interaction in medical tasks.

Method: Proposes RadEyeVideo, which uses eye-fixation data as video sequences to capture gaze dynamics. Evaluated with three LVLMs on CXR report generation and disease diagnosis.

Result: Performance improved by up to 24.6% in report generation and 15.2% on average for both tasks. RadEyeVideo even outperformed task-specific medical LVLMs.

Conclusion: Effectively integrating domain expert knowledge (eye-gaze) with LVLMs enhances general-domain models in clinical tasks, showcasing a scalable human-centered approach.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

*Yiyang Chen,Shanshan Zhao,Lunhao Duan,Changxing Ding,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSD leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) for 3D self-supervised learning by aligning 3D point cloud features with SD features, enhancing performance despite limited 3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D diffusion models are constrained by small datasets. The robust capabilities of SD, trained on large-scale data, can potentially overcome this limitation.

Method: PointSD replaces SD's text encoder with a 3D encoder, trains a point-to-image diffusion model, and aligns 3D backbone features with SD features for semantic learning.

Result: Experiments show SD enhances 3D self-supervised learning, improving performance on downstream point cloud tasks.

Conclusion: PointSD successfully bridges 2D and 3D learning, demonstrating the utility of large-scale 2D models for 3D tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

### [16] [Hybrid Autoregressive-Diffusion Model for Real-Time Streaming Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09105)
*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models is introduced for Sign Language Production (SLP), addressing error accumulation and real-time limitations. It includes a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module and Confidence-Aware Causal Attention for improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier SLP models faced issues like error accumulation during inference and limitations in real-time tasks due to their autoregressive or diffusion-based nature.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive and diffusion methods, featuring a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module and Confidence-Aware Causal Attention for dynamic pose generation.

Result: Experiments on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets show the method's effectiveness in generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully leverages the strengths of autoregressive and diffusion models, improving SLP performance in both quality and real-time applicability.

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoHOI, a robustness benchmark for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, addressing model degradation in real-world conditions. It proposes SAMPL, a learning strategy to improve robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI detection models degrade in real-world scenarios due to unforeseen corruptions, necessitating a benchmark to evaluate and improve robustness.

Method: The authors introduce RoHOI, a benchmark with 20 corruption types, and propose SAMPL, a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning strategy for robust feature learning.

Result: Experiments show SAMPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Conclusion: The paper presents a benchmark and learning strategy to enhance HOI detection robustness, with plans to release datasets and code publicly.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MG-CLIP, a method leveraging the modality gap in CLIP for continual learning, improving performance without extra replay data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked modality gap in CLIP during continual learning, which affects generalization and adaptability.

Method: Analyzes modality gap variations during fine-tuning, then proposes MG-CLIP to preserve and compensate the gap for better continual learning.

Result: MG-CLIP outperforms existing methods on benchmarks, showing improved performance in class-incremental learning.

Conclusion: Modality gap preservation and compensation offer a novel, effective approach for continual learning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SnapMoGen introduces a high-quality text-motion dataset with detailed annotations and proposes MoMask++, a state-of-the-art model for text-to-motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion methods lack fine-grained controllability and generalization due to dataset limitations.

Method: SnapMoGen provides 20K motion clips with detailed text descriptions. MoMask++ uses multi-scale token sequences and a generative masked transformer.

Result: MoMask++ achieves top performance on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks and handles casual user prompts via LLM reformatting.

Conclusion: SnapMoGen and MoMask++ advance text-to-motion generation with improved dataset quality and model performance.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

*Dewen Zhang,Tahir Hussain,Wangpeng An,Hayaru Shouno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseLLM improves language-guided pose estimation by replacing LocLLM's linear projector with a nonlinear MLP, achieving better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pose estimation methods struggle with novel poses or unseen keypoints. LocLLM introduced language guidance but lacked spatial-textual interaction.

Method: PoseLLM uses a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector for hierarchical cross-modal feature fusion, trained on COCO data.

Result: PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on COCO, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, with strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII.

Conclusion: A simple nonlinear connector enhances localization accuracy without compromising generalization, advancing language-guided pose estimation.

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

*Zhimin Liao,Ping Wei,Ruijie Zhang,Shuaijia Chen,Haoxuan Wang,Ziyang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $I^{2}$-World is an efficient 4D occupancy forecasting framework for 3D scenes, using dual tokenizers and an encoder-decoder architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes for forecasting and generating unseen scenarios in autonomous driving systems.

Method: Decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene (multi-scale residual quantization) and inter-scene (residual aggregation of temporal dependencies) tokenizers, with an encoder-decoder architecture for spatial context and temporal consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by 25.1% in mIoU and 36.9% in IoU, with 2.9 GB training memory and real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World provides a compact, efficient, and high-performing solution for 4D occupancy forecasting in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

TL;DR: Stable Score Distillation (SSD) improves text-guided image and 3D editing by enhancing stability, alignment, and editing strength, outperforming existing methods like Delta Denoising Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with stability, spatial control, and editing strength due to reliance on complex auxiliary structures, leading to conflicting signals and imprecise edits.

Method: SSD anchors a single classifier to the source prompt, uses Classifier-Free Guidance for cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a null-text branch for stability. It also includes a prompt enhancement branch for stronger style edits.

Result: SSD achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D editing tasks, including NeRF and style edits, with faster convergence and reduced complexity.

Conclusion: SSD provides a robust, efficient solution for text-guided editing, ensuring coherence and precise modifications.

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth information is robust to appearance variations and carries 3D details, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LGSP-Prompt, a novel method for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL), addressing performance degradation in prompt pool methods by shifting to spatial dimension prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL faces challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning. Existing prompt pool methods degrade in FSCIL due to token-dimension saturation.

Method: Proposes LGSP-Prompt, combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to generate spatial prompts, with dynamic selection from two pools.

Result: LGSP-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, excelling in knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt effectively mitigates token-dimension saturation and outperforms existing methods in FSCIL tasks.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in LVLMs caused by RoPE's long-term decay, proposing MCA-LLaVA to mitigate image alignment bias using Manhattan distance for better multimodal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs stem from misaligned multimodal features, exacerbated by RoPE's long-term decay, which biases perception of image tokens.

Method: Proposes MCA-LLaVA, extending RoPE's decay to 2D spatial decay using Manhattan distance to balance image token perception.

Result: MCA-LLaVA improves multimodal alignment, reducing hallucinations and performing well on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA effectively mitigates image alignment bias, enhancing LVLM performance and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust dynamic scene understanding in applications like autonomous driving and surveillance, where existing methods fail to capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: THYME combines hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to model multi-scale spatial context and enforce temporal consistency.

Result: THYME outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 datasets, improving scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Conclusion: THYME effectively addresses limitations in dynamic scene graph generation, offering a more accurate and coherent solution, supported by a novel dataset.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health
monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further

TL;DR: Proposes Expert-CFG, an expert-in-the-loop framework to align Medical Vision Language Models (MedVLMs) with clinical expertise without additional training, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MedVLMs have probabilistic uncertainties and lack clinical alignment, posing risks in medical applications.

Method: Uses uncertainty estimation, expert-guided reference retrieval, and classifier-free guidance to refine outputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art 13B models with a 4.2B parameter model and limited expert input.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility for clinical use in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

### [29] [Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214)
*Shiyi Mu,Zichong Gu,Hanqi Lyu,Yilin Gao,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes S3AD, a stereo-based 3D anomaly detection algorithm, to improve generalization for arbitrary 3D objects and introduces KITTI-AR, a synthetic dataset for evaluating anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misdetection of rare anomalies in 3D detection models by enhancing generalization and anomaly filtering capabilities.

Method: Decouples 2D and 3D training, introduces anomaly scoring, and uses synthetic datasets (KITTI-AR) for evaluation.

Result: Achieves target-level anomaly scoring and validates performance with KITTI-AR datasets.

Conclusion: S3AD and KITTI-AR effectively enhance 3D anomaly detection generalization and evaluation.

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

*Jingguo Liu,Han Yu,Shigang Li,Jianfeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spherical sampling method for panoramic images is introduced to leverage existing 2D pre-trained models, addressing distortion issues and improving performance in tasks like segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-trained models for 2D images struggle with panoramic image distortions and discontinuities, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a spherical sampling method based on pre-trained model weights to mitigate distortions and uses it for panoramic image segmentation with channel attention masks.

Result: The method achieves favorable initial training values and commendable results on the Stanford2D3D indoor dataset.

Conclusion: The spherical sampling method effectively bridges the gap between 2D pre-trained models and panoramic image tasks, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

### [31] [Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217)
*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Track-On, a transformer-based model for long-term online point tracking, addressing the challenge of causal processing without future frame access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like streaming video and embodied AI require online point tracking, but existing methods rely on offline refinement. The paper aims to enable accurate, long-term tracking in a causal setting.

Method: The authors evaluate visual foundation models for spatial features and propose Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats tracked points as queries, processing frames sequentially with memory for coherence.

Result: Track-On achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven public benchmarks, proving the feasibility of long-term online tracking.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that dedicated designs like Track-On can effectively address the challenges of online point tracking, leveraging visual foundation models and memory mechanisms for robust performance.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM is a unified framework addressing distribution shift and confidence misalignment in foundation models like CLIP and SAM, improving performance across vision and medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of foundation models is hindered by distribution shift and confidence misalignment, which are not adequately addressed by domain-specific solutions.

Method: StaRFM introduces a Fisher information penalty (FIP) for covariate shift and a confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) for uncertainty calibration, both theoretically grounded.

Result: StaRFM improves accuracy (+3.5%), reduces ECE (28%), achieves 84.7% DSC in medical segmentation, and lowers cross-domain performance gaps by 40%.

Conclusion: StaRFM is a plug-and-play solution that enhances foundation models' robustness and calibration across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

*G. Kutay Türkoglu,Julian Tanke,Iheb Belgacem,Lev Markhasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using Stable Diffusion to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric (first-person) views, addressing challenges like occlusions and distorted proportions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate replication of a person's body, clothing, and movements in digital telepresence is challenging from egocentric views due to occlusions and distortions. Existing methods rely on multi-view datasets, limiting accessibility.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses Stable Diffusion and ControlNet to generate realistic frontal views from occluded top-down egocentric images, enabling avatar motion generation from minimal input.

Result: The method reduces training burden and improves generalizability, successfully reconstructing animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.

Conclusion: This approach advances telepresence by making avatar reconstruction more accessible and generalizable from single egocentric images.

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

TL;DR: A novel framework for assessing the dynamic painting process, introducing PPAD dataset and PPJudge model, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on static images, ignoring the dynamic, multi-stage nature of painting.

Method: Introduces PPAD dataset and PPJudge, a Transformer-based model with temporally-aware encoding and mixture-of-experts architecture.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, robustness, and human alignment.

Conclusion: Offers insights for computational creativity and art education.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

TL;DR: AGCD-Net, a model for context-aware emotion recognition, uses hybrid ConvNeXt and causal intervention to mitigate context bias, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for context-aware emotion recognition suffer from context bias, leading to spurious correlations between background context and emotion labels.

Method: AGCD-Net introduces Hybrid ConvNeXt (integrating Spatial Transformer Network and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers) and an Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM) to debias context features.

Result: AGCD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAER-S dataset, demonstrating robust emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of causal debiasing for improving emotion recognition in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

### [36] [Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256)
*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyuan Ge,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AAHR, a framework for image-text matching that addresses ambiguities and leverages high-order relations through dynamic clustering, feature extraction, and GNN-enhanced interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with high-order associations and semantic ambiguities in image-text matching, particularly with soft positive/negative samples and underutilized neighborhood relationships.

Method: AAHR uses dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning, global/local feature extraction, adaptive aggregation, GNN for semantic interactions, and momentum contrastive learning to expand negative samples.

Result: AAHR achieves superior performance on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: AAHR effectively mitigates ambiguities and enhances high-order relation learning, setting a new benchmark for image-text matching.

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A segment-aware visual tokenization framework for gloss-free SLT reduces input sequence length by 50%, lowers memory usage, and improves scalability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scalability and computational demands of gloss-free SLT models as large-scale datasets become more common.

Method: Proposes segment-aware visual tokenization to convert videos into discrete tokens, reducing sequence length. Introduces token-to-token contrastive alignment and dual-level supervision for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 2.67x lower memory usage and outperforms state-of-the-art on PHOENIX14T benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework improves scalability and performance in gloss-free SLT, validated by reduced sequence length and better alignment.

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross Knowledge Distillation (CKD) to improve Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by leveraging RGB data and ANNs, addressing cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs underperform compared to ANNs due to limited annotated event-based datasets and immature architectures. The goal is to enhance SNN performance using knowledge distillation from ANNs.

Method: CKD uses semantic similarity and sliding replacement for cross-modality, and indirect phased knowledge distillation for cross-architecture challenges.

Result: Experiments on N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS show CKD outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods.

Conclusion: CKD effectively improves SNN performance by addressing key challenges in knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt4Trust is a reinforcement learning framework for improving confidence calibration in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for healthcare, enhancing trustworthiness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs in healthcare face issues with prompt sensitivity and overconfidence, which can mislead clinicians relying on model confidence for decision-making.

Method: A lightweight LLM generates context-aware auxiliary prompts to calibrate confidence in downstream MLLMs, prioritizing clinical safety.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art medical VQA performance on PMC-VQA and shows zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs.

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust improves MLLM trustworthiness and accuracy in safety-critical settings, with scalable potential.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

*Chenhao Ding,Jiangtao Zhang,Zongsheng Yue,Hui Wang,Qian Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for blind motion deblurring (BMD) using a deep generative model to improve kernel initialization and reduce sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high non-convexity and sensitivity to initial blur kernel in BMD by leveraging deep generative models.

Method: Pre-train a GAN-based kernel generator and initializer to encode kernel priors and provide better initialization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and extends to non-uniform deblurring without extra priors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances BMD performance by constraining solutions within a latent kernel manifold, offering plug-and-play integration.

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

*Yuval Grader,Hadar Averbuch-Elor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic-aware floorplan localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic rays, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by leveraging rich semantics and coarse-to-fine probability volume refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current floorplan localization techniques ignore rich semantic details like window and door locations, focusing only on depth-based structural cues. This work aims to incorporate these semantics for better accuracy.

Method: The framework constructs a structural-semantic probability volume in a coarse-to-fine manner: initial low-resolution sampling followed by denser sampling in high-probability regions to refine predictions for 2D location and orientation angle.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, showing significant recall improvements. It also benefits from additional metadata like room labels.

Conclusion: The semantic-aware framework enhances floorplan localization by integrating depth and semantic cues, achieving superior performance and flexibility with metadata.

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: Geo-RepNet integrates RGB and depth data for surgical phase recognition, outperforming existing methods in complex ESD procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High visual similarity in surgical phases and lack of structural cues in RGB images necessitate depth-based geometric information for better recognition.

Method: Proposes Geo-RepNet with Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) and Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention (GEMA) modules, built on a RepVGG backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a nine-phase ESD dataset, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Depth information significantly enhances surgical phase recognition, with Geo-RepNet offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

### [44] [DAA*: Deep Angular A Star for Image-based Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09305)
*Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Angular A* (DAA*), a method incorporating Path Angular Freedom (PAF) to improve path smoothness and similarity in imitation learning. It outperforms existing methods in path similarity and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path smoothness is often neglected in imitation learning from expert demonstrations, leading to suboptimal paths. The paper aims to address this gap by introducing adaptive path smoothness.

Method: DAA* integrates PAF into A* to balance path shortening and smoothing. PAF explores the trade-off between minimum and maximum move angles for adaptive path expansion.

Result: DAA* shows significant improvements over Neural A* and TransPath in path similarity metrics (SPR, ASIM, PSIM) and path length reduction.

Conclusion: DAA* effectively enhances path optimality and similarity by jointly optimizing path shortening and smoothing, with minor trade-offs in search efficiency.

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

*Zile Wang,Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALPHA introduces the first RGBA benchmark and ALPHAVAE, a VAE for RGBA images, outperforming prior methods in reconstruction and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models focus on RGB images, leaving transparent/layered (RGBA) content unexplored due to lack of benchmarks.

Method: ALPHAVAE extends a pretrained RGB VAE with an alpha channel, trained using a composite objective for RGBA fidelity.

Result: ALPHAVAE achieves +4.9 dB PSNR and +3.2% SSIM improvements over LayerDiffuse, with superior RGBA generation.

Conclusion: ALPHA and ALPHAVAE provide a scalable solution for RGBA image synthesis, with released code and models for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on
https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

### [46] [ProactiveBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Evaluating Proactive Interactions in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09313)
*Yueqian Wang,Xiaojun Meng,Yifan Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProactiveBench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating proactive interaction in multimodal dialogue systems, with PAUC as a new metric for temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for proactive interaction in multimodal systems, especially in real-time scenarios like video playback.

Method: Introduces ProactiveBench for benchmarking and PAUC, a metric accounting for response timing. Evaluates baselines and human preferences.

Result: PAUC aligns better with human preferences than traditional metrics, offering a more accurate evaluation of proactive systems.

Conclusion: PAUC provides a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction scenarios.

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

*Kaixuan Cong,Yifan Wang,Rongkun Xue,Yuyang Jiang,Yiming Feng,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICCAE, an encoder for fine-grained audio-video alignment that dynamically adjusts confusion loss to distinguish similar activities, achieving 65.5% top-1 accuracy on VGGSound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-video pre-training lacks focus on distinguishing easily confused classes, limiting generalization.

Method: Proposes DICCAE with dynamic confusion loss and a cluster-guided self-supervised pre-training strategy.

Result: Achieves 65.5% top-1 accuracy on VGGSound, with ablation studies validating module necessity.

Conclusion: DICCAE enhances audio-video representation quality by addressing inter-class confusion, proving effective for human activity recognition.

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

### [48] [Fast3D: Accelerating 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models for Efficient 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09334)
*Wencan Huang,Daizong Liu,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast3D is a plug-and-play framework for efficient visual token pruning in 3D MLLMs, leveraging global attention prediction and adaptive pruning to reduce redundancy without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs face computational inefficiency due to excessive object-centric visual tokens, and existing 2D token pruning methods are inadequate for 3D domains.

Method: Proposes Fast3D with two innovations: Global Attention Prediction (GAP) for token importance estimation and Sample-Adaptive Pruning (SAP) for dynamic token budgets.

Result: Validated across five benchmarks, Fast3D achieves effective pruning, especially under high token reduction ratios.

Conclusion: Fast3D addresses computational bottlenecks in 3D MLLMs, enabling efficient deployment without compromising performance.

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

### [49] [An Enhanced Classification Method Based on Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion for Long-tailed Multispectral Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11407)
*TianZhu Liu,BangYan Hu,YanFeng Gu,Xian Li,Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive multi-scale fusion method for classifying multispectral point clouds (MPCs) with long-tailed distributions, addressing sparse labels, scale variations, and imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classification methods struggle with outdoor MPC datasets due to sparse labeled targets, scale differences in land-covers, and long-tailed distributions.

Method: Uses grid-balanced sampling for training, multi-scale feature fusion for learning, and adaptive hybrid loss for classification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three MPC datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses key challenges in MPC classification for outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Svetlana Orlova,Tommie Kerssies,Brunó B. Englert,Gijs Dubbelman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple encoder-only Video ViTs with strong pre-training match or surpass specialized TAD methods, emphasizing self-supervised MVM and DAPT for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if complex architectures are necessary for TAD by leveraging foundation models and pre-training for simpler, efficient solutions.

Method: Uses plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) with various pre-training strategies (weakly-, fully-supervised, self-supervised MVM, and DAPT).

Result: Simple models with strong pre-training outperform specialized TAD methods; self-supervised MVM and DAPT are most effective.

Conclusion: Pre-training is crucial for TAD; simple architectures with proper pre-training can be efficient, effective, and scalable.

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

TL;DR: A novel lightweight neural network system for real-time celestial terrain feature tracking, addressing computational and data scarcity challenges in spaceflight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional photoclinometry-based methods (high cost, slow processing, poor generalization) and computational demands of emerging learning-based techniques.

Method: Proposes lightweight neural networks for real-time execution, improved domain adaptation for detection, and attention alignment for robust landmark description.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in landmark tracking.

Conclusion: The system enhances spacecraft autonomy by enabling efficient, real-time celestial terrain feature tracking with limited labeled data.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modeling individual and interactive movements in multi-person motion prediction, along with high computational costs, drives the need for an efficient solution.

Method: The model uses lightweight dual branches for local/global representations and a cross-level interaction block to integrate spatial and temporal features, including spatial inter-person distance embedding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW datasets while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances performance and efficiency in multi-person motion prediction.

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

TL;DR: CKAA improves continual learning by aligning feature subspaces and aggregating task-specific knowledge, enhancing robustness against misleading task-ids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguous decisions in PEFT-based CL methods due to misaligned feature subspaces from independently trained sub-modules.

Method: Introduces Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA) for feature distribution alignment and Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA) for adaptive knowledge aggregation.

Result: CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods in experiments.

Conclusion: CKAA effectively enhances model robustness and performance in continual learning by addressing subspace misalignment and task-id ambiguity.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

TL;DR: HMID-Net integrates Masked Image Modeling and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space, outperforming MERU and CLIP in image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently train models capturing visual-semantic hierarchies, leveraging hyperbolic space.

Method: Proposes HMID-Net, combining MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space with a custom loss function.

Result: Achieves success comparable to Euclidean space, excelling in image classification and retrieval.

Conclusion: HMID-Net is a novel, efficient method for hierarchical visual-semantic learning in hyperbolic space.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification

### [59] [GLIMPSE: Do Large Vision-Language Models Truly Think With Videos or Just Glimpse at Them?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09491)
*Yiyang Zhou,Linjie Li,Shi Qiu,Zhengyuan Yang,Yuyang Zhao,Siwei Han,Yangfan He,Kangqi Li,Haonian Ji,Zihao Zhao,Haibo Tong,Lijuan Wang,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a new benchmark designed to test if large vision-language models (LVLMs) can genuinely understand videos beyond static frames, requiring full video context and temporal reasoning. Current models struggle, with the best achieving only 66.43% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks rely on frame-level analysis, limiting assessment of LVLMs' true video understanding. GLIMPSE addresses this gap.

Method: GLIMPSE includes 3,269 videos and 4,342 visual-centric questions across 11 categories, crafted to require full video context and temporal reasoning.

Result: Human accuracy on GLIMPSE is 94.82%, but the best LVLM (GPT-o3) scores only 66.43%, showing significant limitations.

Conclusion: LVLMs still struggle with deep video reasoning, highlighting the need for benchmarks like GLIMPSE to push the field forward.

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

*Fuyin Ye,Erwen Yao,Jianyong Chen,Fengmei He,Junxiang Zhang,Lihao Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SDTN and TRN for hyperspectral image classification, addressing high-dimensional data and labeled sample scarcity with tensor decomposition and regularization, achieving high accuracy and reduced computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and scarce labeled samples, leading to suboptimal performance in hyperspectral image classification.

Method: Introduces SDTN for dynamic tensor rank adjustment and TRN for integrating features into a lightweight network to capture multi-scale spectral-spatial features.

Result: Experiments on PaviaU datasets show improved accuracy and fewer model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Yiwen Liang,Hui Chen,Yizhe Xiong,Zihan Zhou,Mengyao Lyu,Zijia Lin,Shuaicheng Niu,Sicheng Zhao,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReTA, a reliable test-time adaptation method for vision-language models, addressing entropy unreliability and inflexible decision boundaries with CER and DDC strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks without labeled data, motivating the need for reliable test-time adaptation.

Method: ReTA integrates Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER) for cache quality and Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC) for adaptive decision boundaries.

Result: ReTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ReTA enhances reliability in test-time adaptation for VLMs, addressing key challenges in cache-based methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HFUT-VUT's solution for micro-gesture recognition in videos uses data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention, achieving a 38.03 F1 score and outperforming prior methods by 37.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenging due to the need to precisely locate and categorize spontaneous micro-gestures in untrimmed videos, which differ significantly from other human actions.

Method: Proposed hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to improve classification and localization.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 38.03, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%, ranking first in the challenge.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenges of micro-gesture recognition, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap is a post-training pruning method for SSM-based models like VMamba, reducing spatial redundancy to improve throughput with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial redundancy in SSM-based vision backbones like VMamba to enhance efficiency without retraining.

Method: Prunes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling.

Result: Achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with <0.9% accuracy drop and similar gains on ADE20K and MedMamba.

Conclusion: QuarterMap is a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency in SSMs, outperforming token merging methods like ToMe.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

*Yunwei Lan,Zhigao Cui,Xin Luo,Chang Liu,Nian Wang,Menglin Zhang,Yanzhao Su,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB is a novel unpaired dehazing framework using Schrödinger Bridge and optimal transport theory to improve image restoration quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN-based unpaired dehazing methods struggle due to limited transport mapping capabilities, hindering their effectiveness.

Method: DehazeSB leverages optimal transport theory for direct distribution bridging, detail-preserving regularization for structural consistency, and prompt learning with CLIP for haze-aware alignment.

Result: The method outperforms others on real-world datasets, producing high-quality dehazed images.

Conclusion: DehazeSB effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering superior performance in unpaired dehazing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct introduces content-aware tokenization and explicit layout modeling for efficient and accurate Key Information Extraction (KIE) from dense documents, achieving SOTA results with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform poorly on dense documents due to inefficient vision tokenization, leading to redundant computation and memory issues.

Method: VDInstruct separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction, using content-aware tokenization to generate tokens proportional to document complexity. A three-stage training paradigm is employed.

Result: The model achieves SOTA on KIE benchmarks, reducing image tokens by 3.6x and surpassing baselines like DocOwl 1.5 by +5.5 F1 in zero-shot evaluations.

Conclusion: Content-aware tokenization and explicit layout modeling improve document understanding, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRPCA-Net, a deep unfolding network, integrates sparsity-aware priors for efficient infrared small target detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between performance and interpretability in deep learning models for infrared small target detection by leveraging sparsity priors.

Method: Proposes Dynamic RPCA Network (DRPCA-Net) with a dynamic unfolding mechanism and Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module for adaptive parameter generation and better background modeling.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy on multiple public infrared datasets.

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net effectively combines model-based priors with deep learning, enhancing robustness and generalization for infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential CSIST Unmixing, a novel task for detecting closely-spaced infrared small targets (CSIST) in dense groups. It addresses challenges like precise sub-pixel localization and lack of datasets by providing SeqCSIST, a benchmark dataset, and DeRefNet, a deep learning framework with a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in detecting distant CSIST groups due to optical and detector limitations, which appear as mixing spots in infrared images. The lack of public datasets further hinders research progress.

Method: The method involves creating SeqCSIST, a benchmark dataset, and proposing DeRefNet, a model-driven deep learning framework with a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module for adaptive inter-frame information aggregation.

Result: Experiments show DeRefNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) by 5.3% on the SeqCSIST dataset.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting the first multi-frame solution for CSIST Unmixing, offering an open-source ecosystem (dataset and toolkit) to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a segmented architecture (EHPE) for 3D hand pose estimation, focusing on accurate TIP and wrist joint prediction to mitigate error accumulation and improve overall joint estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in hand pose estimation, leading to error accumulation and degraded reconstruction quality.

Method: EHPE uses a two-stage approach: (1) TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction (TW-stage) for initial accurate joint configuration, and (2) Prior Guided Joints Estimation (PG-stage) with a dual-branch interaction network to refine remaining joints.

Result: EHPE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, demonstrating improved accuracy in joint estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed EHPE effectively addresses error accumulation in hand pose estimation, enhancing overall reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for artistic typography lack interactivity, localized edits, and iterative refinement, limiting creative workflows.

Method: WordCraft integrates diffusion models with a training-free regional attention mechanism, noise blending for refinement, and a large language model for prompt interpretation.

Result: The system synthesizes high-quality, stylized typography for single- and multi-character inputs across languages, enhancing interactivity.

Conclusion: WordCraft advances artistic typography by enabling creative, user-centered workflows with improved interactivity and flexibility.

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models lack precise visual control and require extensive training for complex multimodal generation.

Method: MENTOR uses a two-stage training paradigm: multimodal alignment for pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by instruction tuning for balanced input integration.

Result: MENTOR outperforms baselines in concept preservation and prompt following, with superior image reconstruction and training efficiency.

Conclusion: MENTOR provides a scalable and efficient solution for multimodal image generation, achieving strong performance despite resource constraints.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction

TL;DR: MA-SAM2 improves surgical video segmentation by addressing SAM2's limitations with context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models, achieving better performance without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's greedy memory design struggles with surgical videos due to rapid movements, occlusions, and complex interactions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: MA-SAM2 introduces training-free context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models, using multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference for efficiency.

Result: MA-SAM2 outperforms SAM2 by 4.36% and 6.1% on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: MA-SAM2 is a practical, efficient solution for surgical video segmentation, enhancing accuracy without additional training or parameters.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

### [74] [Inter2Former: Dynamic Hybrid Attention for Efficient High-Precision Interactive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09612)
*You Huang,Lichao Chen,Jiayi Ji,Liujuan Cao,Shengchuan Zhang,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inter2Former optimizes dense-token processing for interactive segmentation, balancing accuracy and speed on CPU devices through adaptive computation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between accuracy (dense-token methods) and speed (SAM) in interactive segmentation.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Prompt Embedding, Dynamic Hybrid Attention, Hybrid Mixture of Experts, and Dynamic Local Upsampling to optimize computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency on CPU devices.

Conclusion: Inter2Former successfully balances segmentation quality and processing speed, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

*Eman Ali,Sathira Silva,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAIR improves fine-grained classification in VLMs by dynamically aligning image and text features and refining pseudo-labels, outperforming SOTA methods by 2.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised adaptation in VLMs either lack adaptability or are computationally expensive, limiting their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks.

Method: FAIR introduces Class Description Anchors (CDA) and a Learned Alignment Score (LAS) to dynamically align features and refine pseudo-labels through cross-modal interactions.

Result: FAIR achieves a 2.78% performance gain over SOTA methods across 13 fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: FAIR's dynamic alignment and refinement mechanisms significantly enhance fine-grained unsupervised adaptation in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

### [76] [Generate Aligned Anomaly: Region-Guided Few-Shot Anomaly Image-Mask Pair Synthesis for Industrial Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09619)
*Yilin Lu,Jianghang Lin,Linhuang Xie,Kai Zhao,Yansong Qu,Shengchuan Zhang,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAA is a few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework that improves realism, alignment, and generalization in anomaly synthesis for industrial inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly synthesis methods suffer from low realism, poor mask alignment, and limited generalization due to scarce anomaly samples.

Method: GAA uses a pretrained latent diffusion model, Localized Concept Decomposition, Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering, and region-guided mask generation for realistic, diverse, and aligned anomalies.

Result: GAA outperforms on MVTec AD and LOCO datasets in anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks like localization and classification.

Conclusion: GAA addresses key limitations in anomaly synthesis, offering a robust solution for industrial anomaly inspection.

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

*Shomukh Qari,Maha A. Thafar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI framework using MaxViT and other transformer variants achieved 98% accuracy in classifying stroke types from CT scans, enhanced by data augmentation and explainable AI (XAI) for clinical trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate stroke diagnosis is critical for patient outcomes, especially in emergencies. CT scans are widely used, but AI can improve classification and trust in diagnostics.

Method: Used MaxViT and other transformer models for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, no stroke). Applied data augmentation and synthetic image generation to address class imbalance. Integrated XAI (Grad-CAM++) for interpretability.

Result: MaxViT with augmentation achieved 98% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming other models. XAI provided visual explanations for clinical trust.

Conclusion: The framework offers a trustworthy, interpretable AI tool for early stroke detection, aiding clinical integration and improving emergency diagnostics.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

*Leonor Fernandes,Tiago Gonçalves,João Matos,Luis Filipe Nakayama,Jaime S. Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI models for diabetic retinopathy (DR) prediction, assessing fairness and the impact of disentanglement as a bias mitigation technique. Results show high DR prediction accuracy but fairness disparities, with disentanglement yielding mixed effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about fairness and generalization in AI-based DR diagnosis, ensuring equitable healthcare solutions.

Method: Three models (ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, Swin V2) were trained on macula images to predict DR and sensitive attributes (age, gender/sex). Fairness was assessed, and disentanglement was used to mitigate bias.

Result: High DR prediction performance (up to 94% AUROC) but fairness disparities (e.g., 10% AUROC gap between age groups). Disentanglement improved DINOv2 (2% gain) but reduced performance in ConvNeXt V2 and Swin V2.

Conclusion: Fairness in medical imaging AI is crucial, but disentangling fine-grained features is complex. Model selection impacts bias mitigation effectiveness.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

*Zhengyuan Peng,Jianqing Xu,Shen Li,Jiazhen Ji,Yuge Huang,Jingyun Zhang,Jinmin Li,Shouhong Ding,Rizen Guo,Xin Tan,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EyeSeg is an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation framework for AR/VR, addressing motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and domain gaps. It outperforms existing methods in segmentation and gaze estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gaze estimation in AR/VR requires robust eye segmentation, but existing methods struggle with motion blur, occlusion, and domain gaps.

Method: EyeSeg uses Bayesian uncertainty learning to model segmentation uncertainties, outputting both segmentation results and uncertainty scores for robust gaze estimation.

Result: EyeSeg improves segmentation metrics (MIoU, E1, F1, ACC) and enhances gaze estimation robustness under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg effectively addresses key challenges in eye segmentation, offering a robust solution for AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Result: Achieves 92.2% accuracy (PCK@50) on a self-collected dataset and shows robustness on the public MMFi dataset for 3D pose estimation.

Conclusion: VST-Pose offers a reliable, privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in indoor environments.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a
reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in
indoor environments. Our codes are available in

### [81] [Prompt2DEM: High-Resolution DEMs for Urban and Open Environments from Global Prompts Using a Monocular Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09681)
*Osher Rafaeli,Tal Svoray,Ariel Nahlieli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for high-resolution DEM estimation using prompt-based monocular depth estimation, achieving 100x resolution gain and robust generalization across diverse landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution elevation data is crucial for hydrology, urban studies, and ecosystem monitoring, but existing methods like super-resolution and monocular depth estimation have limitations.

Method: Uses low-resolution SRTM data as prompts and high-resolution NAIP imagery, fine-tuning a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs for tasks like DEM estimation and void filling.

Result: Achieves 30-cm resolution (100x gain), <5m MAE relative to LiDAR, and up to 18% improvement over SRTM, with scalability demonstrated in U.S. and Israel.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, accurate solution for global elevation mapping, suitable for environmental and hazard studies.

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExpStar, a model for automatic experiment commentary generation, and ExpInstruct, a dataset supporting this task, outperforming 14 leading LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human teachers spend significant time preparing experiment commentary. Automating this could save time and enhance scientific instruction.

Method: Developed ExpStar, a retrieval-augmented model, and ExpInstruct, a dataset with 7K step-level commentaries across 21 subjects.

Result: ExpStar outperforms 14 leading LMMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ExpStar advances AI-assisted scientific experiment instruction, showing promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

*Phat Nguyen,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A systematic study of token compression techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) reveals gaps in unified categorization and effectiveness on compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a unified survey on token compression methods and their performance on compact ViTs for edge devices.

Method: Present a taxonomy and comparative study of token compression techniques, evaluating them on standard and compact ViT architectures.

Result: Token compression works well for general ViTs but often underperforms on compact designs.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adapting token optimization techniques for compact transformers in edge AI applications.

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

*Yu Lei,Bingde Liu,Qingsong Xie,Haonan Lu,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation (L²-VSD) to improve text-to-3D generation by addressing convergence issues in VSD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome slow and ill-posed convergence in Variational Score Distillation (VSD) by analyzing the interplay between score models and 3D models.

Method: Proposes L²-VSD, a linearized variant of VSD with lookahead optimization, to stabilize training and improve gradient corrections.

Result: L²-VSD outperforms prior score distillation methods and integrates seamlessly into VSD-based frameworks.

Conclusion: L²-VSD effectively enhances text-to-3D generation quality and stability.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

TL;DR: A hybrid geometric and pictorial method for optimal fragment alignment without shape or content assumptions, tested on a new dataset with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail with realistic fragment shapes or rely on restricted geometries, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach for fragment alignment, introduces a new dataset with erosion modeling, and embeds compatibility into a puzzle-solving framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, showing improved compatibility performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively handles realistic fragment shapes and improves puzzle-solving accuracy.

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

### [86] [NegRefine: Refining Negative Label-Based Zero-Shot OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09795)
*Amirhossein Ansari,Ke Wang,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine improves zero-shot OOD detection by refining negative labels and dynamically adjusting scoring for multi-matching images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing negative label-based methods misclassify in-distribution samples as OOD due to subcategory labels and proper nouns, and struggle with multi-matching images.

Method: NegRefine filters subcategory labels and proper nouns from negative labels and uses a multi-matching-aware scoring function.

Result: NegRefine achieves robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples on benchmarks like ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: NegRefine addresses limitations of prior methods, enhancing zero-shot OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRU-Accident is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in safety-critical VRU-vehicle accident scenarios, revealing their limitations in reasoning and causal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks to assess MLLMs' reasoning in VRU safety scenarios motivates the creation of VRU-Accident.

Method: VRU-Accident includes 1K dashcam videos with 6K QA pairs and 1K dense descriptions, focusing on VRU-vehicle accidents.

Result: Evaluation of 17 MLLMs shows they struggle with reasoning about accident causes, types, and preventability.

Conclusion: VRU-Accident highlights MLLMs' gaps in safety-critical reasoning, urging further research in this domain.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

TL;DR: The paper compares human and deep learning models in recognizing 3D objects from sparse point clouds, finding that visual transformers (point transformer) better mimic human performance due to hierarchical abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether deep learning models develop 3D shape representations similar to human vision for object recognition.

Method: Conducted human experiments manipulating point density, object orientation, and local geometric structure, and compared performance with two deep learning models (DGCNN and point transformer).

Result: Humans performed consistently well, while the point transformer model better accounted for human performance due to its hierarchical abstraction mechanism.

Conclusion: The point transformer model's hierarchical abstraction aligns more closely with human 3D shape representation than convolution-based models.

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

*Yongheng Zhang,Xu Liu,Ruihan Tao,Qiguang Chen,Hao Fei,Wanxiang Che,Libo Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTCoT introduces a video-text interleaved reasoning paradigm, outperforming text-only CoT by leveraging visual content and enhancing MLLM neuron activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning relies on text, ignoring visual cues. Humans use both, so ViTCoT aligns reasoning with human cognition.

Method: Developed ViTCoT, a video-text interleaved CoT paradigm, and created ViTIB benchmark using MLLMs for key-video selection.

Result: ViTCoT outperforms text-only CoT and activates more neurons in MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViTCoT offers a more intuitive, cognitively aligned approach to video reasoning, improving performance and model engagement.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpeakerVid-5M, a large-scale dataset for audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human research, with diverse interaction types and quality tiers, and provides a baseline model and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets for audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual human generation, enabling advancements in this emerging field.

Method: Creation of the SpeakerVid-5M dataset (5.2M video clips, 8,743 hours) with structured interaction types and quality tiers, and development of an AR-based baseline model and benchmark VidChatBench.

Result: A comprehensive dataset and baseline model for audio-visual dyadic interaction tasks, facilitating future research.

Conclusion: SpeakerVid-5M fills a critical gap in virtual human research, offering a robust foundation for developing and evaluating audio-visual interactive systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to
focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual
human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

### [92] [Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the bouba-kiki effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10013)
*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper re-evaluates the bouba-kiki effect in vision-and-language models (VLMs) using CLIP variants (ResNet and ViT), finding they lack consistent human-like cross-modal associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if VLMs integrate cross-modal information akin to human cognition, focusing on the bouba-kiki effect.

Method: Two methods: prompt-based evaluation (using probabilities) and Grad-CAM for visual attention in shape-word matching tasks.

Result: Models (ResNet and ViT) do not consistently show the bouba-kiki effect, with ResNet slightly favoring round shapes. Performance falls short of human data.

Conclusion: VLMs lack robust cross-modal understanding, highlighting limitations in their representations and alignment with human cognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 4D human parsing framework that reduces inference time and adds open-vocabulary capabilities, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human part segmentation methods are limited by closed-set datasets and slow inference, hindering their practical use in virtual and extended reality applications.

Method: The framework extends open-vocabulary 3D human parsing to 4D videos using mask-based tracking, a Mask Validation module, and a 4D Mask Fusion module.

Result: The method achieves up to 93.3% faster inference than prior state-of-the-art while handling dynamic 4D human parsing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of speed and flexibility in 4D human parsing, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

*Yiran Qiao,Disheng Liu,Yiren Lu,Yu Yin,Mengnan Du,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CECAS introduces a causally-guided adversarial method for generating high-quality counterfactual visual explanations, avoiding spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual visual explanation methods neglect causal relationships, leading to unintended alterations and limited explanation quality.

Method: CECAS leverages a causally-guided adversarial approach to generate counterfactuals, integrating causal perspectives to avoid spurious perturbations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, achieving balanced validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Conclusion: CECAS effectively addresses limitations of prior methods by incorporating causality, enhancing the quality of counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

*Zhanjiang Yang,Lijun Sun,Jiawei Dong,Xiaoxin An,Yang Liu,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCGA proposes a two-stage method for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from RGB images, using a multi-scale VQ-VAE and attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect the challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional (RGB) to high-dimensional (HSI) data, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) learn spectral patterns using a multi-scale VQ-VAE to extract a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC), and (2) refine RGB-to-HSI mapping by querying MoC. Includes Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention for adaptive feature adjustment.

Result: MCGA achieves state-of-the-art performance in HSI reconstruction, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the RGB-to-HSI challenge, offering a lightweight and efficient solution with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

*Xiuyu Wu,Xinhao Wang,Xiubin Zhu,Lan Yang,Jiyuan Liu,Xingchen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the necessity of strict rotation equivariance in aerial object detection and proposes MessDet, a strictly rotation-equivariant network with a multi-branch head, achieving state-of-the-art performance on aerial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotation equivariance is crucial for aerial object detection due to arbitrary object orientations, but its strict necessity is unclear. Existing methods either rely on data augmentation or achieve only approximate rotation equivariance.

Method: The study implements a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network, compares it with approximate methods, and introduces a multi-branch head to reduce parameters while improving accuracy.

Result: MessDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and DIOR-R datasets with low parameter count.

Conclusion: Strict rotation equivariance enhances aerial object detection, and the proposed MessDet demonstrates its effectiveness with superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack domain-specific reasoning for facial cues due to limited annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised pipeline using ChatGPT to generate QA pairs (FairFaceGPT) from FairFace images.

Result: FaceLLM improves MLLM performance on face-centric tasks and sets new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synthetic supervision via language models enables domain-specialized MLLMs, advancing human-centric AI.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGD is a method for automated graphic design using natural language instructions, combining parametric rendering and image asset generation for editable, scalable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack creativity, intelligence, and editability, making graphic design labor-intensive.

Method: IGD uses a design platform, standardized file format, MLLM for layer prediction, and diffusion models for image generation.

Result: IGD achieves superior, scalable, and editable graphic design outputs.

Conclusion: IGD provides a practical and innovative solution for automated graphic design.

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Result: Achieves 96.36% accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for Devanagari handwritten text recognition, offering high accuracy and potential for digitization.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this
research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari

paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character

TL;DR: Crucial-Diff is a domain-agnostic framework that synthesizes crucial training samples to address data scarcity, outperforming existing methods in detection and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in fields like medical and autonomous driving causes model overfitting and imbalance, limiting performance. Existing synthetic data methods are repetitive and inefficient.

Method: Crucial-Diff integrates SAFE for unified feature extraction and WASM to generate hard-to-detect samples using downstream model feedback.

Result: Achieves 83.63% pixel-level AP and 78.12% F1-MAX on MVTec, and 81.64% mIoU and 87.69% mDice on polyp dataset.

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff effectively mitigates data scarcity by generating diverse, high-quality samples, improving downstream model performance.

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

TL;DR: CrisisLandMark introduces a large-scale corpus of SAR and multispectral images with structured text annotations, and CLOSP aligns optical and SAR images using text, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image retrieval systems focus on RGB data, missing the unique information from sensors like SAR and multispectral data. This limits applications like disaster response and climate monitoring.

Method: The paper presents CrisisLandMark, a corpus of 647,000 SAR and multispectral images with structured text annotations, and CLOSP, a framework aligning optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space using contrastive learning.

Result: CLOSP improves retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models. GeoCLOSP, integrating geographic coordinates, excels in location-dependent tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse sensor data and geographic context is key to unlocking remote sensing archives' potential.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Motivation: To explore the under-examined performance of LLMs in fine-grained fashion attribute recognition and their practical application in e-commerce product attribution.

Method: Zero-shot evaluation of GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash on the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, using images as sole input across 18 fashion attribute categories.

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o-mini with a macro F1 score of 56.79% vs. 43.28%, showing strengths in fashion attribute recognition.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for deploying LLMs in e-commerce and emphasizes the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, paving the way for future fashion AI research.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language

*Zifei Wang,Zian Mao,Xiaoya He,Xi Huang,Haoran Zhang,Chun Cheng,Shufen Chu,Tingzheng Hou,Xiaoqin Zeng,Yujun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining multi-image super-resolution (MISR) and a CNN achieves atomic-scale resolution in 4D-STEM for beam-sensitive materials, outperforming conventional electron microscopy under ultra-low-dose conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation damage in electron microscopy limits its use for beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials.

Method: Adapts MISR principles, fuses low-resolution sub-pixel-shifted views, and uses a CNN with synthetic multi-angle observations for reconstruction. A dual-path, attention-guided network is developed for 4D-STEM.

Result: Achieves atomic-scale resolution from ultra-low-dose data, comparable to conventional ptychography, for various beam-sensitive specimens.

Conclusion: Expands 4D-STEM capabilities, providing a generalizable method for analyzing radiation-vulnerable materials.

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

*Zhipeng Xue,Yan Zhang,Ming Li,Chun Li,Yue Liu,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KPHD-Net improves multi-view classification and clustering by using Hölder divergence and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for better uncertainty estimation and fusion reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack reliability in multi-view integration due to noisy data and ignore domain gaps between modalities.

Method: KPHD-Net uses variational Dirichlet distributions, models evidences, and integrates Hölder divergence with Dempster-Shafer theory and Kalman filter.

Result: KPHD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances multi-view learning performance with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes autoencoder design in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), identifies three key properties, and proposes Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs) to improve image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoders in LDMs lack simultaneous optimization of latent smoothness, perceptual compression, and reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes VMAEs, leveraging hierarchical features from Masked AutoEncoder, and integrates them into LDMs as LDMAEs.

Result: LDMAEs show improved image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VMAEs address limitations of current autoencoders in LDMs, enhancing performance.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmRACE-3K, a dataset for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in embodied settings, highlighting their limitations in interactive environments and proposing a fine-tuning approach to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well in passive tasks but struggle in embodied settings requiring active interaction and spatial reasoning. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors create EmRACE-3K, a dataset of 3,000 language-guided tasks in photorealistic environments, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised and reinforcement learning.

Result: Zero-shot VLMs achieve below 20% success rates on the benchmark, but fine-tuning improves performance across all challenge categories.

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K effectively benchmarks and enhances VLMs' embodied reasoning, demonstrating the need for further research in interactive environments.

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 3DGAA is a novel adversarial attack framework for autonomous driving, jointly optimizing geometry and appearance using 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance realism and robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D/3D adversarial attacks struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness, limiting their effectiveness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: 3DGAA leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to perturb both geometric (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance (color, opacity) attributes, with physical filtering and augmentation modules for realism and generalization.

Result: 3DGAA reduces detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, outperforming existing attacks and maintaining high transferability across physical conditions.

Conclusion: 3DGAA sets a new state-of-the-art for physically realizable adversarial attacks, validating its practicality for evaluating autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Motivation: To enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid accumulation by leveraging microstructural information from multi-shell dMRI data.

Method: A Swin Transformer-based pipeline processes multi-shell dMRI data, using DTI and NODDI metrics projected onto 2D planes. Low-Rank Adaptation is integrated for efficient learning with limited labeled data.

Result: Achieved 95.2% balanced accuracy for Alzheimer's disease dementia vs. cognitively normal, and 77.2% for amyloid-positive vs. amyloid-negative subjects. Explainability identified key brain regions like the hippocampus.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for early Alzheimer's detection and amyloid pathology identification, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited settings.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Conclusion: Future research directions are outlined to advance the field of Anti-UAV tracking.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and

### [110] [Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)
*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I-BSC, an improved method over P-BSC, to address motion errors in dynamic 3D scanning by weighting fringe images instead of phase frames, reducing computational overhead and error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP's static object assumption fails in dynamic measurements, causing motion errors. P-BSC was proposed but has computational and error issues.

Method: I-BSC weights homogeneous fringe images (not phase frames) and computes arctangent once, reducing complexity and errors.

Result: I-BSC outperforms existing methods, achieves quasi-single-shot frame rates, and accelerates computation significantly.

Conclusion: I-BSC is a superior solution for dynamic 3D scanning, offering high resolution and efficiency.

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyma proposes a hypernetwork-based solution for efficient uni-modal model selection and connector training in multi-modal models, reducing search costs by 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and computational demands of selecting and training connectors for uni-modal models in multi-modal setups are addressed.

Method: Hyma leverages hypernetworks to jointly train connector modules for all possible uni-modal model combinations, optimizing selection and training.

Result: Hyma reduces search costs by 10x while maintaining performance comparable to exhaustive grid search.

Conclusion: Hyma offers an efficient, scalable solution for multi-modal model integration, significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

*Seokeon Choi,Sunghyun Park,Hyoungwoo Park,Jeongho Kim,Sungrack Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective optimization framework for memory-efficient personalization of text-to-image diffusion models, combining BP-low and ZO-high methods for high-quality fine-tuning with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt diffusion models for personalization while preserving privacy and operating within edge devices' limited computational resources.

Method: A timestep-aware probabilistic function dynamically selects between BP-low (for target-specific features) and ZO-high (for high-resolution details) based on diffusion timesteps.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced memory consumption, enabling scalable on-device personalization without increased inference latency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances efficiency and quality, making it suitable for edge device applications.

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

TL;DR: LifelongPR is a continual learning framework for point cloud place recognition (PCPR) that addresses catastrophic forgetting and domain shifts, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCPR models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new environments or sensor types, reducing practicality.

Method: Proposes a replay sample selection method and a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight prompt module and two-stage training.

Result: Achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: LifelongPR effectively addresses scalability and forgetting issues in PCPR, validated by experiments on large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly

developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS

Motivation: Poultry farming is vulnerable to diseases; current methods are resource-intensive.

Method: Uses multi-color space features, descriptors, and ANN for classification.

Result: 95.85% accuracy, no GPU needed, 638s execution time.

Conclusion: Cost-effective, interpretable alternative to deep learning for low-resource settings.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Conclusion: MoVieS effectively bridges novel view synthesis and dynamic geometry reconstruction, offering versatility and efficiency.

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D

By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on

segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from exposure bias, impacting their generative capabilities. The paper aims to mitigate this by analyzing energy patterns in noisy images and proposing a solution.

Method: The authors observe energy reduction in noisy images during diffusion, analyze its patterns in low- and high-frequency subbands, and introduce a wavelet-based frequency-domain regulation mechanism.

Result: The proposed method improves generative quality of diffusion models and provides a robust solution to exposure bias, validated across different architectures.

Conclusion: The training-free, plug-and-play approach effectively addresses exposure bias in diffusion models, enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

*Haonan Chen,Xin Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage transfer learning strategy using SegFormer improves water body segmentation in remote sensing, boosting IoU from 25.50% to 64.84% in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shift and small sample sizes in remote sensing water body segmentation.

Method: Two-stage transfer learning: pre-train on a diverse source domain, then fine-tune on a target domain (Zhada Tulin area).

Result: Improved IoU from 25.50% (direct transfer) to 64.84% in the target domain.

Conclusion: The strategy resolves domain discrepancy and offers a solution for high-precision thematic extraction in data-scarce, unique environments.

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

TL;DR: FIX-CLIP enhances CLIP for long-text tasks by introducing dual-branch training, regional prompts, and hierarchical feature alignment, achieving top performance in retrieval and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with long-text inputs (>77 tokens), limiting its effectiveness in under-stream tasks.

Method: Proposes FIX-CLIP with: (1) dual-branch training, (2) learnable regional prompts, and (3) hierarchical feature alignment. Uses 30M images and synthetic long-text captions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. Works well with diffusion models.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP effectively addresses CLIP's long-text limitations while maintaining short-text performance, proving useful for downstream applications.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

TL;DR: A framework for multi-camera multi-target tracking using trajectory and appearance cues for consistent global identity assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure consistent global identity assignment across multiple camera views for accurate multi-target tracking.

Method: Uses BoT-SORT for single-camera tracking, initializes global IDs via trajectory-feature matching, and employs a prioritized global matching strategy for later frames. 3D positions are estimated for spatial validation.

Result: The framework effectively assigns and maintains global identities across views.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves accurate and consistent multi-target tracking across multiple cameras.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

*Ivan Martinović,Josip Šarić,Marin Oršić,Matej Kristan,Siniša Šegvić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised panoptic segmentation method (DEARLi) uses foundation models to enhance recognition and localization, outperforming state-of-the-art with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation is costly; semi-supervised methods and foundation models can mitigate label scarcity, but effective exploitation is underexplored.

Method: DEARLi combines unsupervised mask-transformer consistency with CLIP zero-shot classification for recognition and SAM pseudo-labels for localization.

Result: Achieves 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with 158 labeled images, outperforming state-of-the-art with 8x less GPU memory.

Conclusion: DEARLi excels in challenging semi-supervised scenarios, offering efficient and high-performance segmentation.

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

*Md Abulkalam Azad,John Nyberg,Håvard Dalen,Bjørnar Grenne,Lasse Lovstakken,Andreas Østvik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores SOTA point tracking methods for echocardiography, identifies motion bias issues, and proposes refined training and a lightweight network to improve tracking accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate motion estimation in echocardiography is crucial for cardiac function measurements, but existing methods struggle with intricate cardiac motion.

Method: The study refines training procedures, introduces tailored augmentations, and proposes a lightweight network using multi-scale cost volumes.

Result: Fine-tuning with the proposed strategies improves performance, e.g., EchoTracker boosts accuracy by 60.7% and reduces error by 61.5%. Some SOTA models underperform the proposed simple model.

Conclusion: The refined methods enhance tracking robustness and generalization, improving clinical measurements like GLS and reproducibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: A feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding is introduced in a U-Net architecture, improving performance in noisy conditions and data efficiency compared to feedforward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological vision systems use feedback for refined perception, while most artificial networks lack this, limiting their adaptability and robustness.

Method: Implemented a recurrent feedback loop in a U-Net, using softmax projection and exponential decay for stability. Tested on synthetic segmentation tasks.

Result: Feedback model outperformed feedforward in noisy conditions and generalized better with limited supervision, achieving above-random performance with just two training examples.

Conclusion: Feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, paving the way for more biologically inspired neural architectures.

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

*Shuyu Yang,Yaxiong Wang,Yongrui Li,Li Zhu,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-level domain adaptation method for text-based person retrieval, addressing synthetic-to-real gaps via image and region-level alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and annotation costs drive synthetic data use, but domain gaps (lighting, color, viewpoint) hinder pretrain-finetune effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-level adaptation effectively bridges synthetic-to-real gaps, improving retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECP is a training-free, task-agnostic framework to improve MLLM performance on high-resolution images by leveraging coarse predictions for localization and preserving fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution images due to fixed resolution fine-tuning, leading to poor generalization or loss of details.

Method: ECP uses a two-stage approach: extract candidate regions from downsampled images, then predict final outputs using these regions.

Result: Achieves +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% improvement in 4K GUI grounding and 4K/8K MLLM perception tasks.

Conclusion: ECP effectively addresses high-resolution challenges in MLLMs without additional training, enhancing performance while preserving details.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

### [127] [Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203)
*Shicai Wei,Chunbo Luo,Yang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Asymmetric Representation Learning (ARL) to optimize multimodal learning by imbalanced dependency on modalities, inversely proportional to their variances, improving performance without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning often underperforms unimodal learning due to imbalanced optimization. Existing gradient balancing methods are suboptimal.

Method: ARL uses auxiliary regularizers to calculate modality variances, re-weighting optimization inversely to variance ratios. It also incorporates prediction bias to minimize generalization error.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARL's effectiveness and versatility across datasets.

Conclusion: ARL improves multimodal learning by imbalanced optimization, validated by experiments and requiring no extra parameters.

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of ethnicity in emotional expression, challenging Ekman's universality hypothesis by revealing ethnic biases in micro-expression analysis. It proposes an ethnically aware framework for improved recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the influence of ethnicity on emotional expression, questioning the assumption of emotion universality across cultures.

Method: Constructs a cross-cultural micro-expression database, annotates ethnic labels, and compares mono-ethnicity and stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment. Proposes an ethnically aware framework for feature learning.

Result: Uncovers ethnic bias in micro-expression recognition and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ethnically aware framework.

Conclusion: Ethnicity significantly influences emotional expression, and integrating ethnic context improves micro-expression recognition, challenging universality assumptions.

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

### [129] [Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10213)
*Shicai Wei,Chunbo Luo,Yang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies optimization conflicts in multimodal learning, proposes a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to improve performance, and validates its effectiveness across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning underperforms unimodal learning due to imbalanced optimization between modalities and fusion modules, which existing methods fail to address.

Method: Proposes DGL, which decouples gradient updates for modality encoders and fusion modules by using unimodal loss gradients for encoders and removing interference.

Result: DGL improves performance across diverse modalities, tasks, and frameworks, outperforming unimodal and existing multimodal methods.

Conclusion: DGL effectively resolves optimization conflicts in multimodal learning, enhancing performance and versatility.

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA introduces a part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation, avoiding inference-time fine-tuning and large-scale training while improving fidelity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized human image generation faces challenges in preserving precise attributes (e.g., identity, clothing details) without costly fine-tuning or large datasets.

Method: The method trains only LoRA layers, conditions generation on wardrobe and spatial references, and uses a selective subject region loss to improve alignment with text prompts.

Result: The approach outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis with minimal training samples.

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA offers a practical, efficient solution for high-fidelity personalized human image generation without additional inference parameters.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

TL;DR: VRFNO improves Reflow by optimizing noise couplings and enhancing trajectory distinction, achieving better image generation in fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflow's distribution gap between constructed couplings and real images limits rapid high-quality generation.

Method: VRFNO integrates an encoder and neural velocity field, adding a historical velocity term and noise optimization via reparameterization.

Result: VRFNO outperforms Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art results in one-step and few-step generation.

Conclusion: VRFNO effectively addresses Reflow's limitations, offering superior performance in image generation tasks.

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Motivation: To improve efficiency and accuracy in dense prediction tasks by leveraging higher-dimensional processing.

Method: Lifts 2D inputs (e.g., images) to higher dimensions (e.g., 3D) and processes them with networks like 3D U-Net.

tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProGait, a dataset for vision-based gait analysis of prosthetic legs, supporting tasks like segmentation and pose estimation, with improved model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in vision-based ML methods for gait analysis of prosthetic legs due to their unique appearances and movement patterns.

Method: Introduces the ProGait dataset with 412 video clips from amputees, benchmark tasks, and fine-tuned baseline models.

Result: Baseline models outperformed pre-trained vision models, showing improved generalizability for prosthesis-specific tasks.

Conclusion: ProGait effectively bridges the gap in vision-based gait analysis for prosthetic legs, offering practical applications and performance benchmarks.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynOOD uses foundation models to generate synthetic OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP, improving boundary-level discrimination and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging OOD samples near InD data cause misclassification; foundation models offer a solution.

Method: Iterative in-painting with MLLM-guided prompts and noise adjustments to synthesize boundary-aligned OOD samples, fine-tuning CLIP for better discrimination.

Result: Achieves SOTA on ImageNet: +2.80% AUROC, -11.13% FPR95, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: SynOOD effectively enhances OOD detection by leveraging synthetic data and foundation models.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

TL;DR: The paper addresses weaknesses in AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) models, introducing ITW-SM dataset and identifying four key factors for real-world performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated AI-generated images threatens digital integrity, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Introduces ITW-SM dataset and evaluates four factors (backbone architecture, training data, pre-processing, augmentation) affecting AID performance.

Result: Modifications yield a 26.87% average AUC improvement in real-world AID models.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical factors for enhancing AID models' real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

*Ben Hamscher,Edgar Heinert,Annika Mütze,Kira Maag,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style transfer in semantic segmentation reduces texture bias and boosts robustness against image corruptions and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if style transfer, known to reduce texture bias in image classification, can similarly benefit semantic segmentation by enhancing shape reliance.

Method: Style transfer applied to images with random Voronoi cell areas, training DNNs for semantic segmentation to reduce texture dependence.

Result: Style transfer augmentation decreases texture bias and significantly improves robustness to corruptions and adversarial attacks across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Style transfer is effective for semantic segmentation, generalizing well across models and datasets to enhance robustness and shape-based learning.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA) to exploit background textures in sparse-input object-centric scenarios, significantly impacting camera pose estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Background textures in sparse-input scenarios can heavily influence pose estimation accuracy, prompting the need for adversarial methods to test model robustness.

Method: KBA uses identical segments to create discs with multi-fold radial symmetry, maintaining high viewpoint similarity. A projected orientation consistency loss optimizes these segments.

Result: Optimized adversarial kaleidoscopic backgrounds effectively attack various camera pose estimation models.

Conclusion: KBA demonstrates the vulnerability of pose estimation models to adversarial backgrounds, highlighting the need for robust solutions.

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTCFormer introduces a clustering-based downsampling module for dynamic vision token generation, improving feature representation by focusing on semantic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers use uniform grid-based tokens, ignoring semantic meanings of image regions, leading to suboptimal features.

Method: FTCFormer uses clustering-based downsampling, DPC-FKNN for clustering centers, SCS for token assignment, and Cmerge for token merging.

Result: Improvements of 1.43% (fine-grained), 1.09% (natural), 0.97% (medical), and 0.55% (remote sensing) over baseline.

Conclusion: FTCFormer effectively enhances feature representation by prioritizing semantic regions, validated across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IP-FVR is a novel method for face video restoration that uses a reference image for identity conditioning, decoupled cross-attention, and feedback learning to minimize identity drift, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to preserve identity-specific features in severely degraded face videos, producing average-looking results.

Method: IP-FVR leverages a reference image for identity conditioning, uses decoupled cross-attention, feedback learning for intra-clip drift, and exponential blending for inter-clip drift.

Result: IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in quality and identity preservation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: IP-FVR shows strong potential for practical face video restoration by effectively preserving identity and enhancing quality.

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo is a novel visual encapsulation method for video MLLMs, addressing semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence with its Visual Concept Discriminator and Temporal Focus Calibrator modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear projectors in video MLLMs cause semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence, while resampler structures show potential but lack effective solutions.

Method: DisCo integrates a Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) for semantic distinctness and a Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) for temporal coherence.

Result: DisCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video understanding benchmarks and improves token efficiency.

Conclusion: DisCo effectively enhances visual token quality in video MLLMs, offering a robust solution for semantic and temporal challenges.

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) outperforms single-stream variants and achieves top BLEU-4 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early SLT systems rely on costly gloss annotations, which may not capture continuous signing complexity. This work aims to eliminate gloss dependency.

Method: Uses contrastive visual-language pretraining with dual visual backbones, aligning outputs with text embeddings. Features are fused for encoder-decoder SLT.

Result: Outperforms single-stream variants and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score on Phoenix-2014T benchmark among gloss-free SLT approaches.

Conclusion: The dual encoder framework is effective for gloss-free SLT, offering improved performance without gloss annotations.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMD, a framework using diffusion models for image feature matching, addressing misalignment issues in foundation models and improving multi-instance matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works ignored misalignment when using foundation models for feature matching, leading to poor performance in multi-instance scenarios.

Method: IMD integrates generative-based diffusion models for instance-level details and introduces a cross-image interaction prompting module for bidirectional information flow.

Result: IMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 12% improvement on the new IMIM benchmark for multi-instance matching.

Conclusion: IMD effectively mitigates misalignment in foundation models for feature matching, demonstrating superior performance in multi-instance scenarios.

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

TL;DR: QLIP introduces a text-prompt-guided quantization method for diffusion models, improving efficiency and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for diffusion models ignore input conditions like text prompts, limiting efficiency.

Method: QLIP uses text prompts to dynamically select bit precision per layer and time step, integrating with existing quantization techniques.

Result: QLIP reduces computational complexity and enhances image quality across datasets.

Conclusion: QLIP effectively addresses the inefficiency of diffusion models by leveraging text prompts for quantization.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Motivation: To enhance generalization in wall segmentation by leveraging domain-specific features like texture and wall width.

Method: Uses a U-Net backbone with a multi-headed feature extractor trained on wall patches to inject features into the latent space.

Result: Outperforms vanilla U-Net, validating the feature-guided approach.

Conclusion: FGSSNet's feature injection improves segmentation accuracy, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VRGAdapter, a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter, to capture diverse textual descriptions and inter-class relationships in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using a Vertex Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) and probabilistic message propagation. It also introduces an Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme for robust ensemble prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic textual feature adapters fail to capture the diversity in textual descriptions and inter-class relationships, limiting their effectiveness in downstream tasks.

Method: VRGAdapter models diverse descriptions and inter-class relationships with VRKG, uses probabilistic message propagation for context-aware representations, and employs reparameterized sampling for adapter learning. UMF dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of VRGAdapter and UMF.

Conclusion: VRGAdapter offers a general solution for textual adapters, outperforming traditional methods by leveraging description diversity and inter-class relationships, while UMF enhances robustness.

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD), addressing the challenge of detecting visually similar objects. It proposes the MSHC method and a new dataset, FGZSD-Birds, demonstrating superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object detection (ZSD) works focus on coarse-grained detection, but real-life scenarios often involve fine-grained objects with minute differences, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: The MSHC method improves a two-stage detector with multi-level semantics-aware embedding alignment loss to align visual and semantic spaces tightly.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing ZSD models on the new FGZSD-Birds dataset, which includes 148,820 images across 1,432 species.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses FG-ZSD, introducing a novel method and dataset, proving its effectiveness in fine-grained detection tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

TL;DR: FOCAL is a test-time framework that enhances visual perception robustness by leveraging foundation models to optimize transformations without retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on specialized architectures or predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. FOCAL aims to achieve robust perception without these constraints.

Method: FOCAL generates and optimizes candidate transformations toward visually typical views using internet-scale visual priors from foundation models.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across challenging transformations like 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts, and day-night variations.

Conclusion: FOCAL challenges the need for transform-specific training, offering a scalable path to invariance in visual perception.

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential

*Aaryam Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A TDA feature engineering pipeline integrates topological features with deep learning, improving ResNet18 performance on remote sensing datasets like EuroSAT and RESISC45.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CNNs' bias towards texture-based features by leveraging TDA's robustness in describing complex datasets.

Method: Proposes a TDA feature engineering pipeline and integrates topological features with deep learning models for remote sensing classification.

Result: Improves ResNet18 accuracy by 1.44% on EuroSAT (99.33%) and 1.82% on RESISC45, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: TDA features enhance deep learning performance even on datasets without explicit topological structures, broadening TDA's applicability.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

*Qiang Li,Qingsen Yan,Haojian Huang,Peng Wu,Haokui Zhang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SC-AGIQA, a framework for assessing AI-generated image quality by addressing semantic misalignment and detail perception issues using text-visual semantic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CLIP or BLIP struggle with semantic misalignment and missing details in AI-generated images, necessitating a more robust evaluation framework.

Method: SC-AGIQA integrates text-visual semantic constraints with two modules: TSAM for semantic alignment using MLLMs and FFDPM for fine-grained distortion perception via frequency-domain analysis.

Result: SC-AGIQA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances the evaluation of AI-generated image quality by addressing key challenges in semantic alignment and detail perception.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 4D-Animal reconstructs animatable 3D animals from videos without sparse keypoints, using a dense feature network and hierarchical alignment for accurate, efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on labor-intensive sparse keypoints, which are unreliable due to limited training data.

Method: Proposes a dense feature network for SMAL parameter mapping and a hierarchical alignment strategy integrating silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues.

Result: Outperforms model-based and model-free baselines, producing high-quality 3D assets.

Conclusion: 4D-Animal offers efficient, stable, and scalable 3D reconstruction, with potential for broader 3D applications.

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

TL;DR: CoralVQA is the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis, addressing domain-specific challenges and enabling user-friendly interaction with coral reef images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coral reefs are vital but vulnerable ecosystems requiring expert interpretation. VQA, powered by LVLMs, can simplify interaction with coral imagery but lacks dedicated datasets.

Method: Developed CoralVQA with 12,805 coral images and 277,653 QA pairs, using a semi-automatic pipeline involving marine biologists for quality and scalability.

Result: CoralVQA benchmarks LVLMs, revealing limitations and opportunities for vision-language reasoning in coral reef contexts.

Conclusion: CoralVQA supports future LVLM development and coral conservation by providing a comprehensive dataset and insights.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

### [153] [RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10461)
*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet introduces content-adaptive convolution (RAPConv) and dynamic feature fusion (PAN-DFF) for pansharpening, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs for pansharpening lack adaptability to local content variations, limiting precision in spatial detail extraction.

Method: RAPNet uses RAPConv for spatially adaptive kernels and PAN-DFF with attention for balanced spatial-spectral fusion.

Result: RAPNet achieves superior performance on public datasets, validated by metrics and qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: The adaptive components of RAPNet significantly enhance pansharpening accuracy and detail preservation.

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

*Zhicun Yin,Junjie Chen,Ming Liu,Zhixin Wang,Fan Li,Renjing Pei,Xiaoming Li,Rynson W. H. Lau,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel blind facial image restoration method (RefSTAR) is proposed, focusing on reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction to improve identity preservation and feature transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with identity preservation due to improper feature introduction from reference images.

Method: RefSTAR includes a reference selection module (RefSel), a feature fusion paradigm for transfer, and a reconstruction mechanism with redesigned cycle consistency loss.

Result: Superior performance in identity preservation and reference feature transfer, validated on various backbone models.

Conclusion: RefSTAR effectively addresses blind facial restoration challenges, with code and datasets made publicly available.

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

*David G. Shatwell,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GT-Loc is a retrieval-based method for jointly predicting image capture time (hour/month) and geo-location (GPS) using aligned embeddings in a shared feature space, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timestamp prediction is linked to geo-localization due to visual cues' geographic dependency, necessitating a joint approach.

Method: GT-Loc uses separate encoders for images, time, and location, aligning embeddings in a shared space with a temporal metric-learning objective for cyclical time.

Result: GT-Loc surpasses previous time prediction methods and achieves competitive geo-localization results, enabling compositional and text-based retrieval.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing time and location prediction improves accuracy and enables versatile retrieval applications.

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining federated learning, indoor localization, and vision-based detection achieves 99.99% accuracy for fall detection in older adults while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the aging population and the high risk of falls necessitate effective, reliable, and privacy-preserving detection systems.

Method: The framework integrates three systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detector (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based fall recognition system.

Result: SF2D achieves 99.19% accuracy, vision-based detection 96.3%, and navigation 95%, combining for an overall 99.99% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is highly reliable, safe, and privacy-preserving for fall detection in older adults.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

TL;DR: A confidence-based self-distillation method for polyp segmentation reduces resource usage while outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of large, over-parameterized deep learning models in polyp detection, which are prone to overfitting and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes a confidence-based self-distillation approach using dynamic confidence coefficients and previous iteration data storage, avoiding extra computation or memory during testing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across diverse datasets from multiple clinical centers.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, effective, and resource-friendly, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, addressing gaps in existing methods, and proposes NFM-DRA, a new state-of-the-art approach combining disentangled representations with a memory bank mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive benchmark for retinal anomaly detection has hindered progress, leading to limited anomaly types, saturated test sets, and poor generalization. Existing benchmarks also overlook labeled abnormal and unlabeled data.

Method: The authors introduce a systematic benchmark and propose NFM-DRA, which integrates disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) with a Normal Feature Memory to improve performance on unseen anomalies.

Result: NFM-DRA achieves state-of-the-art performance but shows performance drops on certain unseen anomalies. The benchmark is publicly available.

Conclusion: The benchmark and NFM-DRA advance retinal anomaly detection by addressing data and methodological limitations, though challenges remain in handling unseen anomalies.

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper compares methods for conditioning transformers on camera geometry in multi-view computer vision tasks, proposing a new encoding (PRoPE) that improves performance in tasks like novel view synthesis, stereo depth estimation, and spatial cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage geometric relationships between viewpoints for better 3D perception in multi-view transformers by grounding visual tokens in 3D space.

Method: Comparison of token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and the proposed PRoPE (Projective Positional Encoding) that captures complete camera frustums.

Result: PRoPE improves performance in novel view synthesis, stereo depth estimation, and spatial cognition, even with out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: Relative camera conditioning, especially PRoPE, enhances transformer performance across various tasks and settings.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using high-resolution Earth observation data and deep transfer learning to map 21 million crop fields in Mozambique, achieving high accuracy and revealing insights into smallholder agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of smallholder agriculture systems, particularly spatial distribution and field size, for science-based policy design.

Method: Integration of very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation data with deep transfer learning to delineate crop fields at a national scale with minimal reference data.

Result: Produced the first national dataset of Mozambique's 21 million fields with 93% accuracy, identifying fragmented rural regions and varying field sizes linked to socio-economic and environmental factors.

Conclusion: Field size is a critical indicator for understanding agriculture's socio-economic and environmental impacts, aiding policy design for sustainability.

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

TL;DR: ReVQ transforms pre-trained VAEs into VQ-VAEs efficiently, reducing training costs by 100x while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs is computationally expensive, requiring thousands of GPU hours. This work aims to reduce these costs by leveraging pre-trained VAEs.

Method: ReVQ integrates channel multi-group quantization to expand codebook capacity and a post rectifier to reduce quantization errors, enabling rapid VQ-VAE training.

Result: ReVQ compresses ImageNet into 512 tokens with rFID=1.06 and reduces training time to 22 hours on a single GPU, compared to 4.5 days on 32 GPUs for other methods.

Conclusion: ReVQ offers a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for training VQ-VAEs, achieving superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

### [163] [Think Clearly: Improving Reasoning via Redundant Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08806)
*Daewon Choi,Jimin Lee,Jihoon Tack,Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve reasoning in large language models by removing redundant tokens in reasoning paths, enhancing accuracy without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning paths in large language models contain redundancy, leading to scattered attention and incorrect answers. Addressing this can improve performance.

Method: Identify redundancy using token-level attention scores to an end-of-thinking token, apply structure-aware pruning to remove low-contributing tokens, and resume reasoning.

Result: The method significantly improves accuracy on reasoning benchmarks, especially in mathematical competitions like AIME and AMC.

Conclusion: Removing reasoning redundancy enhances model performance, particularly in complex tasks, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

*Fuh-Hwa Franklin Liu,Su-Chuan Shih*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel MCA approach combining two VGA models is proposed to improve efficiency and fairness in evaluations, addressing challenges like subjective judgment and data variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of existing MCA methods (DEA, SFA, MCDM) due to assumptions, subjective judgment, and data variability, ensuring comprehensive and dependable evaluations.

Method: Combines two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models, rooted in linear programming, to enhance MCA methodology.

Result: Demonstrated accuracy and transparency through numerical examples, offering a robust and adaptive solution.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances automated decision systems and decision support systems, promoting efficiency and fairness in evaluations.

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

*Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,Jayd Matyas,Logan Cross,Davide Paglieri,Minsuk Chang,William A. Cunningham,Simon Osindero,William S. Isaac,Joel Z. Leibo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) principles and the Entity-Component pattern to create a flexible framework for generative AI in multi-actor environments, demonstrated by the Concordia library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diverse use cases of generative AI (Simulationist, Dramatist, Evaluationist) by providing a flexible scenario definition framework.

Method: Inspired by TTRPGs, the approach uses the Entity-Component pattern, where a configurable Game Master (GM) entity is composed of reusable components, separating implementation from design.

Result: The Concordia library exemplifies this philosophy, enabling users to configure scenarios tailored to their goals while ensuring modularity and scalability.

Conclusion: The TTRPG-inspired, Entity-Component-based approach supports rapid iteration and scalability, making it effective for diverse generative AI applications.

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging
from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation.
Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist,
Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition
framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from
tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible
for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly
determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the
Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM
is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed
of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a
separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an
engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and
configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the
components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid
iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We
describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this
philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure
scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioAnalyst, an AI Foundation Model for biodiversity conservation, uses transformer-based architecture and multi-modal data to improve tasks like species distribution modeling and habitat assessments, outperforming existing methods in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biodiversity loss threatens ecological balance, requiring advanced tools for monitoring and conservation. AI Foundation Models offer adaptable solutions for these challenges.

Method: BioAnalyst is a transformer-based model pre-trained on multi-modal data (species records, remote sensing, climate variables) and fine-tuned for tasks like species distribution modeling and invasive species detection.

Result: BioAnalyst outperforms existing methods, especially in data-scarce scenarios, setting a new accuracy baseline for ecological forecasting.

Conclusion: Openly releasing BioAnalyst aims to foster collaboration and advance AI-driven solutions for biodiversity conservation.

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for
ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of
biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the
sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,
including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive
species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local
and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and
conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation
Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by
leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to
various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity
conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model
tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst
employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal
datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,
climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,
allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species
distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species
detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's
performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability
compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two
distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological
forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to
the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in
biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological
challenges.

*Joel Becker,Nate Rush,Elizabeth Barnes,David Rein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI tools increased task completion time by 19% for experienced developers, contrary to forecasts and expert predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the real-world impact of AI tools on software development productivity.

Method: Conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 16 experienced developers completing 246 tasks, with AI tool usage randomly allowed or disallowed.

Result: AI tools slowed developers by 19%, contradicting forecasts (20% reduction) and expert predictions (38-39% reduction).

Conclusion: The slowdown effect is robust and unlikely due to experimental design, suggesting AI tools may hinder productivity in certain contexts.

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development
in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the
productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate
AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an
average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow
or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers
primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.
Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce
completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that
allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing
AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers
down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%
shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and
evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could
contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality
standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although
the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the
robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely
to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

*Ronghua Shi,Yiou Liu,Xinyu Ying,Yang Tan,Yuchun Feng,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi,Xuhui Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework called Hide-and-Shill to detect market manipulation in decentralized finance (DeFi), integrating innovations like GRPO, a theory-based reward function, and multi-modal agent pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi lacks centralized oversight, enabling market manipulation like pump-and-dump schemes. The paper aims to detect such activities using decentralized, multi-agent methods.

Method: The MARL framework models manipulators and detectors in an adversarial game, using GRPO for stability, a theory-based reward function, and multi-modal data (LLM, social graphs, on-chain data).

Result: Hide-and-Shill achieves high detection accuracy and causal attribution, validated on 100,000 real-world episodes and adversarial simulations.

Conclusion: The work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, offering a decentralized solution for real-time DeFi market intelligence.

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world
discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill
achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This
work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new
paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at
the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and
reproducibility.

*Matous Kozak,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam,Siva Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the security risks of LLM-based coding agents, revealing 21% of actions are insecure, and proposes mitigation strategies with varying success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the security implications of deploying LLM-based coding agents in software development.

Method: Systematic security evaluation of 12,000 actions across five models on 93 real-world tasks, identifying vulnerabilities and testing mitigation strategies.

Result: 21% of agent actions were insecure, with GPT-4.1 showing 96.8% mitigation success. Four major vulnerability categories were identified.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for security-aware design in LLM-based coding agents and provides a framework for future evaluations.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development,
yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while
capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce
insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of
autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five
state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world
software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of
agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial
variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system
that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure
(CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies
including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness
between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8%
mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for
evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware
design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To raise awareness and public support for preventing catastrophic AI risks by illustrating potential omnicidal scenarios.

Method: Presents a taxonomy and examples of AI-driven events that could lead to human extinction.

Result: Identifies plausible scenarios where AI could cause widespread human harm, emphasizing the need for preventive action.

Conclusion: Public awareness of these risks can drive institutional support for measures to mitigate catastrophic AI outcomes.

Abstract: This report presents a taxonomy and examples of potential omnicidal events
resulting from AI: scenarios where all or almost all humans are killed. These
events are not presented as inevitable, but as possibilities that we can work
to avoid. Insofar as large institutions require a degree of public support in
order to take certain actions, we hope that by presenting these possibilities
in public, we can help to support preventive measures against catastrophic

*Chenglin Zhu,Tao Zhang,Chong Li,Mingan Lin,Zenan Zhou,Jian Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EduFlow is an end-to-end framework for improving scientific reasoning in MLLMs, featuring EduPRM for step-wise critique and EduMCTS for adaptive search, achieving better coherence and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform in scientific tasks due to poor reasoning patterns, incoherent multi-step inference, and lack of self-correction. EduFlow addresses these gaps.

Method: EduFlow integrates EduPRM (a reward model for step critiques) and EduMCTS (a search framework with self-reflection). It uses curriculum learning and constructs a dataset (EduMCTS-160K).

Result: EduFlow improves reasoning consistency and coherence in scientific tasks.

Conclusion: EduFlow advances MLLMs' scientific reasoning capabilities through structured critique and adaptive search, with plans to release resources.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific
tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning.
Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of
global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective
self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We
introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline
of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based
trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core
is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with
tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three
complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected
critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to
multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We
further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces
bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as
a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It
further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward
higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and
rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of
educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models
will be released.

TL;DR: The paper explores merging explainability and adaptability in AI, focusing on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems to evaluate how knowledge representation impacts LLMs querying triplestores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for both interpretability and adaptability in AI systems, particularly in LLMs and generative AI.

Method: Systematic evaluation of knowledge representation's impact on LLMs querying triplestores in Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.

Result: Findings show that knowledge structure and complexity significantly affect LLM performance in querying triplestores.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of knowledge representation in designing transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems.

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and
next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true
in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly,
generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or
scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are
particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is,
investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI
systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and
query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper,
we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations
of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in
this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our
results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss
their impact and implications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-Stackelberg games, integrating LLMs into strategic leader-follower interactions, capturing bounded rationality and asymmetric information through novel equilibrium concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model strategic interactions with LLMs, addressing limitations of classical Stackelberg games (complete information, rational agents) by incorporating probabilistic reasoning and adaptation.

Method: Defines reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, using structured prompts and LLMs for strategy adaptation. Illustrated with a spearphishing case study.

Result: Demonstrates cognitive richness and adversarial potential in LLM-mediated interactions, applicable to cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Conclusion: LLM-Stackelberg games offer a robust framework for decision-making in complex, real-world domains.

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential
decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into
strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from
classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,
our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,
generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through
internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:
reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal
prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning
equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized
models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded
rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We
illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and
a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This
example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of
LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide
a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as
cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

*Hang Wang,Junshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a shift from reactive to proactive multi-agent reinforcement learning using generative AI to address challenges like joint action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reactive methods fail in novel scenarios due to limitations like stimulus-response mechanisms. A proactive approach using generative AI could overcome these.

Method: Advocates for generative AI-based reinforcement learning, where agents model environment evolution, predict behaviors, and generate coordinated actions.

Result: Enables proactive decision-making, enhanced coordination, and dynamic adaptation, unlocking emergent collective behaviors.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift promises solutions to intractable coordination challenges in autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that
conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint
action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates
moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current
methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when
facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from
reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based
reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as
isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of
synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions
based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than
responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model
environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated
action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term
dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation
capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless
coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving
scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented
possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual
optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine
collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,
robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination
challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

Motivation: Address high computational costs of iterative sampling in diffusion-based planning methods.

Method: Leverages Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient, single-step trajectory optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on D4RL benchmark with higher returns and fewer steps.

Conclusion: CTP is practical and effective for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

TL;DR: A novel framework using Metropolis-Hastings sampling trains Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for RL tasks, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient but challenging to train for RL due to non-differentiable spikes. This work addresses this by avoiding gradient-based methods.

Method: Uses Metropolis-Hastings sampling to propose and accept parameter updates based on rewards, bypassing backpropagation.

Result: Outperforms Deep Q-Learning and prior SNN-based RL methods in reward maximization and resource efficiency on AcroBot and CartPole benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MH-based framework effectively trains SNNs for RL, offering a viable alternative to gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient
alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control
systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of
spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our
knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling,
a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL
environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach
iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates
based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations
of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic
platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks:
AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach
outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL
approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing
network resources and training episodes.

Motivation: To address the environmental and ethical issues arising from AI's rapid expansion, beyond just performance metrics.

Method: The review draws from recent studies and institutional reports to analyze systemic issues like emissions, hardware turnover, and infrastructure disparities.

Result: Identifies key research gaps in AI's environmental and ethical impact, emphasizing the need for sustainable and transparent practices.

Conclusion: AI's progress must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship for a sustainable and inclusive future.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent years,
yet its rapid expansion brings overlooked environmental and ethical challenges.
This review explores four critical areas where AI's impact extends beyond
performance: energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste), inequality in
compute access, and the hidden energy burden of cybersecurity systems. Drawing
from recent studies and institutional reports, the paper highlights systemic
issues such as high emissions from model training, rising hardware turnover,
global infrastructure disparities, and the energy demands of securing AI. By
connecting these concerns, the review contributes to Responsible AI discourse
by identifying key research gaps and advocating for sustainable, transparent,
and equitable development practices. Ultimately, it argues that AI's progress
must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship to ensure
a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.

*Margherita Martorana,Francesca Urgese,Mark Adamik,Ilaria Tiddi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic framework combines multimodal language models with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and ontologies to enhance interoperability in personal service robots, showing GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick as top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions, limiting adaptability and scalability. Combining multimodal language models with KGs and ontologies aims to address these issues.

Method: The proposed framework integrates robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), evaluating KG consistency and effectiveness.

Result: GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick outperform other models, but newer models don't always yield better results, emphasizing the importance of integration strategy.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic framework successfully supports interoperability in robotic applications, with model performance dependent on integration rather than novelty.

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic
environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance.
These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1
and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our
findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,
highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating
ontology-compliant KGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A PyTorch-based toolkit for stochastic control in AI systems ensures fairness and robustness in multi-agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems interacting with multiple agents need fairness and robustness guarantees, requiring complex stochastic reasoning.

Method: The toolkit uses stochastic control techniques to model AI systems and their repeated interactions, ensuring closed-loop fairness and robustness.

Result: The toolkit simplifies providing a priori fairness and robustness guarantees for multi-agent AI systems.

Conclusion: The open-source PyTorch toolkit effectively addresses the complexity of fairness and robustness in closed-loop AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The
regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees
of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents'
responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees
require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here,
we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic
control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties
of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a
closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these
interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity
associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of
multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys methods to shorten lengthy reasoning chains in large reasoning models (LRMs) and adapt between fast and slow thinking for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs generate redundant reasoning chains for trivial questions, wasting resources and increasing response time, hindering practical applications.

Method: The survey reviews methodologies, benchmarks, and challenges for concise and adaptive reasoning in LRMs.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of progress in efficient reasoning for LRMs.

Conclusion: Aims to help researchers understand the field and inspire adaptive thinking solutions for better LRM usage.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

### [182] [Causality-informed Anomaly Detection in Partially Observable Sensor Networks: Moving beyond Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09742)
*Xiaofeng Xiao,Bo Shen,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) for optimal sensor placement in anomaly detection, addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating causality without impractical interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for real-time monitoring in AI-driven manufacturing requires efficient sensor placement strategies, but existing methods often ignore causality or rely on impractical interventions.

Method: The proposed Causal DQ integrates causal information into Q-network training, improving convergence and theoretical error bounds.

Result: The method reduces anomaly detection time significantly across various settings, proving effective for large-scale data streams.

Conclusion: The approach not only enhances sensor placement but also offers broader applications for causality-informed reinforcement learning in engineering.

Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show logical inconsistency despite their capabilities; the paper aims to harness their knowledge in formal reasoning.

Method: Directly integrate an LLM into the interpretation function of formal semantics for paraconsistent logic.

Result: Experimental evidence shows feasibility using datasets from factuality benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method provides a neuro-symbolic framework that preserves the logic's soundness and completeness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Motivation: Address the unprecedented risks posed by rapid AI development, including loss of control and power concentration.

Method: Outline key technical interventions to enable a coordinated halt on dangerous AI activities.

Result: Demonstrates how interventions can restrict dangerous AI and support governance plans.

Conclusion: Technical interventions can form a foundation for AI governance to mitigate worst-case outcomes.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI systems poses unprecedented risks, including loss

navigate these risks and avoid worst-case outcomes, governments may proactively
establish the capability for a coordinated halt on dangerous AI development and

interventions may contribute to restricting various dangerous AI activities,
and show how these interventions can form the technical foundation for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Light fine-tuning with 20 long CoT examples from a reasoning model significantly improves a base model's reasoning, outperforming larger models. Human-written CoT and non-reasoning model data fall short, highlighting the unique value of expert reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether minimal tuning or prompting can induce long CoT reasoning in base models, leveraging high-quality examples to unlock strong reasoning capabilities.

Method: Light fine-tuning of a base model (Qwen2.5-32B) using 20 long CoT examples from a reasoning model (QwQ-32B-Preview). Also tested CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators with prompt engineering and editing.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms the larger Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct. Human-written and non-reasoning model CoT data did not match reasoning model performance.

Conclusion: Expert reasoning traces are hard to replicate, but small, high-quality CoT datasets can effectively activate reasoning in base models. A human-authored dataset is released for further study.

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in
diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning
traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like
DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without
fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be
induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20
long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly
fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms
the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of
high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further
explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced
with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,
neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that
certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze
key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and
answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,
we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small
quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our
human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further
investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets instruction-tuned large language models as neurosymbolic AI systems, using natural language as the symbolic layer and grounding through internal representations, aiming to improve learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of neural networks (scalable learning) and symbolic AI (verifiable reasoning) by redefining large language models within a neurosymbolic framework.

Method: Proposes a framework where natural language acts as the symbolic layer in neurosymbolic AI, with grounding via the model's internal representations. Develops novel learning and reasoning approaches aligned with traditional paradigms.

Result: Preliminary evaluations on axiomatic deductive reasoning tasks show promising effectiveness in enhancing learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: The reinterpretation of large language models as neurosymbolic systems offers a viable path to integrate scalable learning with robust reasoning, supported by initial positive results.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and
classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of
large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous
classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be
integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose
reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded
symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and
grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within
this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning
approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and
reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive
reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the
effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning
reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VerifyBench, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers of LLM-generated responses, highlighting trade-offs between specialized and general verifiers and their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of verifiers for LLM-generated responses, which hinders reliable RLVR development.

Method: Constructed VerifyBench with 4,000 expert-level questions across domains, annotated by experts, and tested verifiers under varied conditions.

Result: Specialized verifiers excel in accuracy but lack recall; general models are inclusive but inconsistent. Verifiers struggle with input structure and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical bottlenecks in verifier technology, emphasizing the need for improved flexibility and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge
is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference
answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.
Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based
verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM
judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building
better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'
performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable
development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address
this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for
systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions
covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is
equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the
evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a
multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental
framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized
verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.
complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers
fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve
leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show
stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover
verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in
cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks
of current verifier technology.

*Xiaoyang Yu,Youfang Lin,Shuo Wang,Sheng Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMDPG algorithm resolves the conflict between monotonic improvement and partial parameter-sharing in heterogeneous MARL by introducing Optimal Marginal Q and Generalized Q Critic, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous MARL requires partial parameter-sharing for high performance, but existing methods like HAPPO fail due to policy drift when combined with sequential updates.

Method: Proposes OMDPG with Optimal Marginal Q and Generalized Q Critic, using a Centralized Critic Grouped Actor architecture for stable updates.

Result: OMDPG outperforms state-of-the-art MARL baselines in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: OMDPG effectively balances monotonic improvement and parameter-sharing, advancing heterogeneous MARL performance.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

TL;DR: The paper explores latent intentionality in data using Promise Theory's Semantic Spacetime model, offering a low-cost method to distinguish intended content from ambient context without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to practical intent in science and technology, proposing a method to interpret latent intentionality pragmatically.

Method: Uses process coherence and scale separation in Semantic Spacetime to identify intended content and ambient context, assessing anomalies and work done to form them.

Result: Provides an elementary, low-computational-cost method for interpreting latent intentionality, feasible for basic organisms.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical, scalable way to assess intentionality without advanced training or reasoning, though concept formation depends on agent memory capacity.

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning reliability by using the model's intrinsic veracity encoding to dynamically select accurate reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning in LLMs and MLLMs suffers from error accumulation in intermediate steps, undermining reliability.

Method: Leverage truthfulness-sensitive attention head activations to train a confidence predictor, dynamically selecting reasoning paths via beam search.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and reliability across reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a novel reliability improvement path for CoT reasoning with broad applicability.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning
capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the
accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel
approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's
intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head
activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based
on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of
each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically
selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and
Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and
commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in
both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on
large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning
models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction
ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement
path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in KG interoperability by automating SPARQL translation between schemas.

Method: Tested three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407) with zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought variants on two benchmarks.

Result: Performance varied by model and prompting; Wikidata-to-DBpedia translations outperformed DBpedia-to-Wikidata.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for SPARQL translation but require further optimization for schema-specific challenges.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)
schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and
later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

### [193] [On Gradual Semantics for Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10076)
*Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a family of gradual semantics for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), filling a gap in computational argumentation by extending modular gradual semantics from QBAFs to ABA frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradual semantics are useful for ABA frameworks, but existing work has not addressed this. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks to abstract ABA frameworks and generalize modular gradual semantics from QBAFs. They also explore an argument-based approach as a baseline.

Result: The proposed gradual ABA semantics satisfy adapted properties like balance and monotonicity. Experiments compare these semantics with an argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends gradual semantics to ABA frameworks, demonstrating their applicability and comparing them with existing methods.

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained
alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a
dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of
acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,
bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,
to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this
has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it
being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications
where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and
propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which
are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do
so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of
(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular
gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy
suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as
balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that
leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.
Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our
gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess

*Harshal Nandigramwar,Syed Qutub,Kay-Ulrich Scholl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlueGlass is a framework for integrating diverse AI safety tools to ensure robust and reliable AI systems, demonstrated through analyses on vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety tools are fragmented and lack integration, necessitating a unified approach for comprehensive AI safety.

Method: Introduces BlueGlass, a framework for composite AI safety workflows, and applies it to vision-language models for object detection.

Result: Three analyses reveal performance trade-offs, hierarchical learning dynamics, and interpretable concepts, showcasing BlueGlass's utility.

Conclusion: BlueGlass provides foundational infrastructure for robust AI systems by enabling integrated safety workflows.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety
of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target
different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in
isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This
paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI
safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration
and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and
outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present
three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object
detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and
potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer
dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and
(3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this
work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more
robust and reliable AI systems.

*Sadig Gojayev,Ahmad Anaqreh,Carolina Fortuna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores AI planning and RL approaches for orchestrating edge-cloud application migration, modeled as Towers of Hanoi problems, and introduces a new classification based on state space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and compare techniques for automating application migration in edge-cloud systems, ensuring high QoS and cost-effectiveness.

Method: Analyzes MDP, AI planning, and RL approaches, focusing on problems modeled as Towers of Hanoi, and introduces a state space-based classification.

Result: Identifies and compares state-of-the-art techniques for orchestrating migration in computing continuum environments.

Conclusion: Provides insights into effective methods for automating application migration in edge-cloud systems, highlighting the role of AI and RL.

Abstract: Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost
effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration
is typically solved with heuristic approaches. Starting from the Markov
Decision Process (MDP), in this paper, we identify, analyze and compare
selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud
application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH)
problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and
analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand
available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in
emerging computing continuum environments.

### [196] [Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10124)
*Thomas T. Hills*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using metacognitive prompts, like 'could you be wrong?', to debias LLMs by revealing latent biases and contradictions in their responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop general debiasing strategies for LLMs that remain effective as models evolve, inspired by human decision-making interventions.

Method: Applying metacognitive prompts from human psychology to LLMs, focusing on the prompt 'could you be wrong?' to elicit hidden biases and reflections.

Result: The prompt successfully uncovers biases, errors, and contradictory evidence in LLM responses, improving alignment with user intent.

Conclusion: Human psychology offers valuable insights for prompt engineering in LLMs, providing scalable debiasing methods.

Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,
what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies
for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for
debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they
incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge
into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of
information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and
contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if
prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making
literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show
promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"
Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional
information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,
contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their
initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and
users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a
set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including
implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be
wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent
metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing
but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive
prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for
prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based
improvements to human decision making.

### [197] [FRSICL: LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning Flight Resource Allocation for Fresh Data Collection in UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10134)
*Yousef Emami,Hao Zhou,Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan,Kai Li,Luis Almeida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes FRSICL, an LLM-based online method for UAV wildfire monitoring, outperforming DRL and baselines in minimizing AoI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL methods for UAV wildfire monitoring suffer from inefficiency and simulation-reality gaps, making them unsuitable for time-critical tasks.

Method: FRSICL uses LLM-enabled in-context learning to optimize UAV flight control and data collection in real time, leveraging natural language descriptions.

Result: Simulations show FRSICL outperforms PPO and Nearest-Neighbor methods in minimizing average AoI.

Conclusion: FRSICL offers a more efficient and dynamic solution for real-time UAV wildfire monitoring compared to traditional DRL approaches.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

### [198] [Adaptability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Framework and Unified Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10142)
*Siyi Hu,Mohamad A Hady,Jianglin Qiao,Jimmy Cao,Mahardhika Pratama,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'adaptability' as a key concept to evaluate MARL algorithms in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems, proposing a framework with three dimensions for principled assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL's real-world deployment is limited due to dynamic and complex environments, requiring algorithms to handle shifting conditions effectively.

Method: The authors propose a structured framework centered on adaptability, with three dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability.

Result: The framework aims to provide a more principled way to assess MARL performance beyond traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work supports the development of MARL algorithms better suited for dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

### [199] [Introducing the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph: AI for Context-Aware Nutrition Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10156)
*Lubnaa Abdur Rahman,Ioannis Papathanail,Stavroula Mougiakakou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwissFKG, a knowledge graph integrating recipes, ingredients, substitutions, and nutritional data, addressing gaps in current dietary assessment systems. It uses LLMs for enrichment and demonstrates their effectiveness, while also showcasing a Graph-RAG application for personalized nutrition queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dietary assessment systems often ignore non-visual factors like ingredient substitutions and individual dietary needs. Switzerland lacks a centralized resource for nutrition-related data, prompting the creation of SwissFKG.

Method: The authors develop SwissFKG, a knowledge graph, and use LLMs for enrichment. They benchmark four LLMs for food knowledge augmentation and implement a Graph-RAG application for nutrition queries.

Result: LLMs effectively enrich SwissFKG with nutritional information. The graph provides ingredient-level details and aligns with guidelines, enabling personalized dietary assessment.

Conclusion: SwissFKG bridges gaps in dietary assessment by combining visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions, paving the way for advanced tools in nutrition.

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through
multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic
dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as
recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter
nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including
allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In
Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains
fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant
nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we
introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our
best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with
nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national
nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment
pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first
benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge
augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the
graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe
recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and
dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional
guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the
SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer
user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by
comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,
our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment
tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

### [200] [Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10174)
*Yumi Omori,Zixuan Dong,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares Decision Transformer (DT) with Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) in sparse-reward environments, finding FBC outperforms DT in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the superiority of DT in offline RL, especially in sparse-reward settings, by proposing a simpler alternative (FBC).

Method: Experiments on Robomimic and D4RL benchmarks, comparing FBC (filtering low-performing trajectories and applying BC) with DT.

Result: FBC achieves competitive or superior performance to DT, with less data and computational cost.

Conclusion: DT may not be preferable in sparse-reward or dense-reward environments, questioning its overall utility.

Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

TL;DR: The paper addresses gaps in XAI research by proposing a method to categorize studies under 'what, why, and who' dimensions, aiming to improve design and reporting standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve contradictions and lack of design recommendations in XAI research by better understanding tasks requiring AI assistance.

Method: The method involves drawing from visual analytics, cognition, and dashboard design to categorize and compare XAI studies, focusing on task descriptions, context, and user testing.

Result: Key issues identified include inadequate task descriptions, context-free studies, and insufficient user testing. The paper proposes reporting user expertise and study guidelines to improve generalizability.

Conclusion: The contribution aims to help researchers identify relevant studies, address gaps, and manage contradictory XAI design results.

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis
tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design
recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI
assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,
cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and
comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified
the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,
and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should
specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to
illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study
guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's
ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can
help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant
to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory
results regarding XAI design.

Motivation: To understand the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic performance in CVRP research.

Method: Combines ISA with a dataset from DIMACS 12th Challenge, using PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages for dimensionality reduction and machine learning to project instance space.

Result: Identified 23 relevant instance characteristics and created a 2D projection matrix for analyzing new instances.

Conclusion: ISA provides a new method for instance analysis in CVRP, enabling better understanding of metaheuristic behavior.

Abstract: This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of
understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and
metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a
valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the
ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on
Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant
instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages,
which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us
to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how
the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of
our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward
to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for

TL;DR: A novel model combining BERT for sentiment analysis and XGBoost for socio-demographic/behavioral data predicts student dropout with 84% accuracy, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of school dropout in distance learning is critical for intervention and student perseverance.

Method: Combines BERT for sentiment analysis of student comments and XGBoost for socio-demographic/behavioral data, fine-tuned and merged for prediction.

Result: Achieved 84% accuracy, outperforming the baseline (82%), with better precision and F1-score.

Conclusion: The model is a promising tool for personalized dropout prevention strategies.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early
detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance.
Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely
researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning
platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources,
including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to
accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic
and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We
fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were
then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in
XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year,
achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model.
Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics,
such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in
developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces architectures for efficient knowledge transfer in data-scarce domains using neural memory and hypernetworks, demonstrating success in 3D scene generation, segmentation, and molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of transfer learning in domains with limited data, such as computational chemistry and medical imaging, where large pre-trained models are impractical.

Method: Utilizes neural memory for adaptation on non-stationary distributions and hypernetworks trained with MAML for generalizable priors, applied to 3D scene generation, segmentation, and molecular property prediction.

Result: Demonstrates efficient prior acquisition with few samples, faster text-to-3D generation, and improved molecular property prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures enable effective transfer learning in data-scarce domains, offering practical solutions for computational chemistry, immunology, and medical imaging.

Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks
stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and
computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,
where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream
tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of
task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,
due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational
models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational
immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our
work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of
priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we
demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on
non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that
our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire
more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene
generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a
handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We
then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel
scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed
scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a
pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,
addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spatial ModernBERT, a transformer model with spatial embeddings, is introduced for extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents, achieving high accuracy through token classification and post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured data from financial documents is crucial for auditing, analytics, and automation, but existing methods struggle with complex layouts.

Method: The model uses three token classification heads (Label, Column, Row) and is pretrained on PubTables-1M, then fine-tuned on financial documents. Post-processing merges tokens and reconstructs layouts.

Result: Spatial ModernBERT effectively combines textual and spatial cues, achieving robust performance in table and key-value extraction.

Conclusion: The proposed model and post-processing method enable accurate extraction of structured data from complex financial documents.

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

### [208] [SEALGuard: Safeguarding the Multilingual Conversations in Southeast Asian Languages for LLM Software Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08898)
*Wenliang Shan,Michael Fu,Rui Yang,Chakkrit,Tantithamthavorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard is a multilingual guardrail for LLM systems, addressing the gap in detecting unsafe and jailbreak prompts in low-resource languages. It outperforms LlamaGuard, improving detection metrics significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails like LlamaGuard fail with multilingual unsafe inputs, leaving LLM systems vulnerable, especially in low-resource languages.

Method: Adapts a multilingual language model using LoRA, constructs SEALSBench dataset (260k+ prompts in 10 languages), and evaluates against LlamaGuard.

Result: SEALGuard improves Defense Success Rate by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieves top DSR, precision, and F1-score.

Conclusion: SEALGuard enhances LLM safety alignment by effectively filtering multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts.

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the shortcomings of current datasets used for evaluating LLMs in medical question answering and propose improvements.

Method: Reviewed benchmark datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU) and alternative sources like medical journal challenge questions for rigor, transparency, and clinical relevance.

Result: Existing datasets lack clinical realism and validation; alternatives are limited in scope and size, exposing gaps in evaluation tools.

Conclusion: A standardized framework and collaboration are needed for rigorous, unbiased, and clinically representative LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

*Rongyi Zhu,Yuhui Wang,Tanqiu Jiang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIMS is a self-improving model-steering framework for LLMs that operates without external supervision, outperforming conventional methods in effectiveness and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional model-steering methods rely on externally annotated data, limiting adaptability and effectiveness. SIMS addresses this by eliminating the need for external supervision.

Method: SIMS autonomously generates and refines contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, using prompt ranking and contrast sampling for enhanced steering.

Result: SIMS outperforms existing methods in steering effectiveness and adaptability across diverse LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Self-improving model steering, as demonstrated by SIMS, is a promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

*Drew Walker,Jennifer Love,Swati Rajwal,Isabel C Walker,Hannah LF Cooper,Abeed Sarker,Melvin Livingston III*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines stigmatizing language in EHRs, finding higher rates among marginalized groups and certain healthcare providers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how EHRs perpetuate patient stigmatization, particularly among historically marginalized groups.

Method: Used lexicon matching and supervised learning to identify linguistic features in MIMIC-III EHR, analyzed with Poisson regression.

Result: Higher stigmatizing labels for Black patients, those with certain insurances or conditions, and increased use by nurses and social workers.

Conclusion: Stigmatizing language in EHRs disproportionately affects marginalized patients and is perpetuated by various providers.

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

*Ana Chkhaidze,Reshanne R. Reeder,Connor Gag,Anastasia Kiyonaga,Seana Coulson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations vary by imagery phenotype, with strong imagers reporting complex content and weak imagers reporting simple patterns. Vision-language models captured these differences better than text-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how individual differences in visual imagery (absent, typical, vivid) impact the complexity of hallucinations induced by Ganzflicker.

Method: Analyzed free-text descriptions of hallucinations from 4,000+ participants using NLP tools, comparing vision-language and text-only models.

Result: Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic hallucinations, while weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Vision-language models better captured these differences.

Conclusion: Individual variation in visual imagery may reflect differences in coordination between early visual and higher-order brain regions.

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard is a framework that linearizes Transformer-based LLMs into subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based LLMs struggle with memory and computational bottlenecks due to quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms. Lizard aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Lizard introduces a subquadratic attention mechanism with a gating module, combining gated linear attention and sliding window attention for long-range and local interactions. It also includes a hardware-aware training algorithm.

Result: Lizard achieves near-lossless performance recovery of the teacher model, outperforming prior linearization methods by 18 points on MMLU and excelling in associative recall tasks.

Conclusion: Lizard provides a flexible, efficient solution for infinite-context generation, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The ALIGN system personalizes LLM-based decision-makers by aligning them to fine-grained attributes through prompts, offering robust configuration, structured reasoning, and swappable LLM backbones. It supports qualitative and quantitative comparisons of alignment approaches in domains like public opinion surveys and medical triage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users have diverse values and preferences affecting decision-making, requiring novel LLM alignment and personalization methods beyond existing benchmarking tools.

Method: The ALIGN system uses prompt-based alignment to fine-grained attributes, featuring configuration management, structured reasoning, and swappable LLM backbones. It includes a user interface for qualitative comparisons and a modular backend for algorithm integration.

Result: Quantitative analysis compares alignment approaches in public opinion surveys and medical triage, demonstrating the system's versatility.

Conclusion: The open-source ALIGN framework advances research on reliable, responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenCodeReasoning-II, a 2.5M question-solution-critique dataset, is introduced to enhance reasoning-based LLMs for code generation and critique. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy improves model performance, surpassing prior open-weight models. The LiveCodeBench benchmark is extended for C++ evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for large-scale, high-quality datasets to advance reasoning-based LLMs in code generation and critique.

Method: Two-stage supervised fine-tuning: first for code generation, then joint training for generation and critique.

Result: Qwen2.5-Instruct models outperform or match prior open-weight models in code generation. Integrated models improve competitive coding performance.

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II and the fine-tuning strategy significantly enhance LLM performance in code reasoning. The extended LiveCodeBench supports better evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

*Jialong Mai,Xiaofen Xing,Yawei Li,Zhipeng Li,Jingyuan Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism to address the limitations of SLLMs in processing long audio sequences for speech emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high frame rate in speech modality restricts SLLMs' processing capacity, and existing token compression methods ignore emotional continuity across conversation turns.

Method: Proposes DPM, which encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to handle unlimited-length audio.

Result: DPM significantly enhances SLLM's emotion recognition in long audio sequences, outperforming existing methods on the IEMOCAP dataset.

Conclusion: DPM effectively extends SLLM capabilities for long audio processing in SER, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Taolin Zhang,Maosong Cao,Alexander Lam,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompassJudger-2 is a generalist judge model for LLM evaluation, addressing specialization and robustness issues. It uses task-driven data curation, verifiable rewards, and a refined learning objective, outperforming larger models and introducing a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current judge models for LLM evaluation are narrowly specialized and lack robustness, limiting comprehensive evaluations.

Method: Task-driven multi-domain data curation, verifiable rewards, rejection sampling, and margin policy gradient loss.

Result: CompassJudger-2 outperforms larger models (e.g., DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-235B-A22B) and introduces JudgerBenchV2 for standardized evaluation.

Conclusion: CompassJudger-2 advances robust, scalable LLM judgment and sets new performance and evaluation standards.

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

TL;DR: OPENXRD is an open-book pipeline for crystallography QA, using GPT-4.5-generated references to aid smaller models. It improves accuracy, especially for models with limited crystallography training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address copyright issues with scanned textbooks and enhance smaller models' understanding of XRD by providing domain-specific references.

Method: Integrates textual prompts with GPT-4.5-generated summaries, evaluated on 217 expert-level XRD questions using vision-language models like GPT-4, Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements in models using GPT-4.5 summaries, particularly those with limited crystallography training.

Conclusion: OPENXRD demonstrates the potential of AI-generated texts to enhance reasoning in scientific tasks and lays groundwork for future NLP tools in materials science.

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight model (PU-Lie) for deception detection in Diplomacy, combining BERT embeddings, interpretable features, and PU learning, achieves 0.60 macro F1 with 650x fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is challenging due to subtle language and extreme class imbalance (less than 5% deceptive messages).

Method: Combines frozen BERT embeddings, interpretable linguistic/game-specific features, and PU learning to handle unlabeled data.

Result: Achieves 0.60 macro F1, outperforming seven models, with 650x fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: PU learning, interpretability, and speaker-awareness are key; detecting deception is prioritized over truthfulness.

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multimodal misinformation, especially ambiguous or context-lacking claims, challenges automated fact-checking systems.

Method: RAMA uses strategic query formulation, cross-verification evidence aggregation, and a multi-agent ensemble of multimodal LLMs.

Result: RAMA outperforms benchmarks, particularly in resolving ambiguous claims by grounding verification in retrieved evidence.

Conclusion: Integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning is crucial for reliable multimedia verification, with RAMA offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

*Ameen Ali,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fine-tuning method using neuron pruning improves LLM generalization by removing dataset-specific mechanisms, outperforming non-pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often rely on dataset-specific correlations, harming performance on novel tasks. The goal is to enhance generalization by pruning such mechanisms.

Method: Uses Integrated Gradients to identify and prune neurons linked to dataset-specific performance, forcing reliance on generalizable representations.

Result: Pruning-based fine-tuning significantly boosts performance on multiple-choice benchmarks, surpassing prior adaptation methods.

Conclusion: Selective neuron pruning effectively enhances LLM generalization, offering a robust alternative to traditional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tibetan is underrepresented in large language models due to scarce high-quality training data, limiting generative AI advancements for the language.

Method: Curated the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus, applied a dedicated cleaning pipeline, and adapted a multilingual base model into Banzhida. Evaluated using new Tibetan benchmarks and public benchmarks.

Result: Banzhida outperforms similar-scale open-source models and Tibetan-tailored models across various tasks.

Conclusion: The work advances generative AI for Tibetan by addressing data scarcity and demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

*Biagio Scalingi,Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro,Paolo Canal,Valentina Bambini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaClimage, a database of visual metaphors for climate change, and analyzes their impact compared to literal images. Visual metaphors are harder to understand but more aesthetically pleasing, with no difference in efficacy or arousal. They elicit more tags and positive valence, suggesting deeper cognitive engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the impact of visual metaphors in climate change communication and provide a structured database for future studies.

Method: Created MetaClimage, a database of visual metaphors paired with literal images, enriched with human ratings (difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, emotional arousal) and NLP-derived semantic/emotion variables from tags.

Result: Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult but aesthetically pleasing, with no difference in efficacy or arousal. They elicited more tags, positive valence, and dominance, indicating deeper cognitive engagement.

Conclusion: Visual metaphors of climate change involve a cognitive trade-off but offer benefits like aesthetic appeal and positive valence, aiding environmental communication.

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

*Yuchen Su,Yonghua Zhu,Yang Chen,Diana Benavides-Prado,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) to improve humour translation in LLMs, achieving significant gains in humour, fluency, and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with humour translation due to linguistic interference and lack of humour in outputs, hindering cross-cultural communication.

Method: Proposes HDM using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to mimic human thought processes and integrates humour theory to enhance translated humorous texts.

Result: Experiments show average improvements of 7.75% in humour, 2.81% in fluency, and 6.13% in coherence.

Conclusion: HDM effectively enhances humour translation quality in LLMs, bridging cultural gaps.

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

TL;DR: ClaritySpeech is a framework that corrects dementia-affected speech using ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot TTS, improving privacy and accessibility without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dementia alters speech, creating communication and privacy challenges. Current ASR struggles with atypical speech, limiting accessibility.

Method: Integrates ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot TTS to correct speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data settings.

Result: Achieves 16% and 10% F1 drop for ADReSS/ADReSSo, improves WER (0.73 to 0.08/0.15), and enhances speech quality (1.65 to ~2.15).

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech effectively balances privacy and accessibility for dementia-affected speech, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15
for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and
accessibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATE-LM is a benchmark for evaluating data attribution methods in LLMs, focusing on tasks like training data selection, toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. It reveals no single method excels in all tasks and highlights trade-offs with simpler baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic evaluation for data attribution methods in LLMs motivated the creation of DATE-LM to standardize and simplify assessments.

Method: DATE-LM is introduced as a unified benchmark, evaluating data attribution methods through three key tasks and enabling large-scale evaluations across diverse LLM architectures.

Result: No single method dominates all tasks; performance varies with task-specific designs, and simpler baselines sometimes outperform complex methods.

Conclusion: DATE-LM provides a foundation for future research, with a public leaderboard to encourage community engagement and method comparison.

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the DRAGON Longformer model for better binary classification of medical case descriptions.

Method: Hyperparameter tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments (e.g., increased sequence length, adjusted learning rates, extended training epochs, added medical terminology).

Result: Accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%, precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from 71.0% to 85.2%.

Conclusion: The optimized model shows strong performance in clinical NLP, with potential for broad healthcare applications.

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter
tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key
modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper synthesizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning approaches to enhance LLMs, proposing synergized frameworks for improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of RAG in multi-step inference and reasoning-oriented approaches in grounding facts, aiming to unify both for better performance.

Method: Maps reasoning-enhanced RAG and RAG-enhanced reasoning, then introduces synergized frameworks where LLMs interleave search and reasoning iteratively.

Result: Identifies state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-intensive benchmarks through synergized RAG-reasoning frameworks.

Conclusion: Outlines future research for deeper, more effective, adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric RAG-reasoning systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

*Changli Wang,Rui Wu,Fang Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm generation dataset, and ViSP, a framework using PPO and contrastive learning to improve sarcasm generation, outperforming baselines and producing higher-quality sarcastic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sarcasm research over-relies on text and ignores visual cues, leading to a mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes ViSP, integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive learning to generate sarcastic texts, leveraging reward scores and encouraging higher-quality outputs.

Result: ViSP surpasses baselines, including large language models, with higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity (0.768 vs. 0.739).

Conclusion: ViSP effectively improves sarcasm generation quality, demonstrating the value of multimodal approaches and the limitations of text-only methods.

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

*Junjie Liu,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-based ABSA approach with data augmentation and reinforcement learning to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA methods struggle with short text, small/unbalanced labeled data, and poor-quality augmented data.

Method: Uses LLM to generate augmented training data and reinforcement learning to optimize augmentation quality.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on English benchmark datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses data imbalance and improves ABSA model performance.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GoalfyMax is a protocol-driven framework for multi-agent collaboration, enhancing coordination, memory reuse, and adaptability in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI systems lack coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition, limiting scalability in complex environments.

Method: Introduces an A2A communication layer (MCP), Experience Pack (XP) memory system, and features like multi-turn dialogue and dynamic safety validation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse on complex task benchmarks.

Conclusion: GoalfyMax is a scalable foundation for future multi-agent intelligent systems.

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

*Junjie Wu,Gefei Gu,Yanan Zheng,Dit-Yan Yeung,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ref-Long, a benchmark to evaluate long-context referencing in language models, revealing significant shortcomings even in advanced models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context referencing is underexplored despite its importance, prompting the need for a dedicated benchmark.

Method: Proposes Ref-Long, a benchmark with three subsets (synthetic to realistic), requiring models to identify document indexes referencing a specific key.

Result: Tests on 13 LCLMs show notable deficiencies in referencing, with further analyses providing key insights.

Conclusion: Ref-Long highlights gaps in LCLMs' referencing abilities, offering a tool for future improvements.

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how errors in prompts affect LLMs' performance in machine translation and evaluation, showing that prompt quality significantly impacts results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humanly plausible and synthetic errors in prompts influence LLMs' performance in translation and evaluation tasks.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs with varying noise levels in prompts, including quantitative analysis and qualitative insights.

Result: Prompt quality strongly affects translation; character-level and combined noise degrade performance more than phrasal noise. LLMs can still translate with illegible noise.

Conclusion: Lower prompt quality leads to poorer instruction following, not direct translation quality loss, and LLMs remain functional even with extreme noise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting definition modeling systems to Belarusian, proposing a new dataset and highlighting gaps in automatic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist lexicographers by leveraging existing models for unsupported languages like Belarusian.

Method: Adapting existing definition modeling systems using a novel dataset of 43,150 Belarusian definitions.

Result: Minimal data is needed for adaptation, but automatic metrics have limitations.

Conclusion: Definition modeling can aid lexicography, but further work is needed to improve evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet
unsupported languages. In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to
Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX introduces cross-lingual financial embeddings for Korean and English, outperforming baselines on financial benchmarks while highlighting tokenizer importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General sentence embeddings fail in financial contexts due to jargon, temporal shifts, and bilingual misalignment, especially in low-resource languages like Korean.

Method: NMIXX is fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets (paraphrases, hard negatives, translations) and evaluated on KorFinSTS, a new financial benchmark.

Result: NMIXX's multilingual variant achieves significant gains (+0.10 on English FinSTS, +0.22 on KorFinSTS) over baselines, with a trade-off in general STS performance.

Conclusion: Tokenizer design is crucial for low-resource cross-lingual adaptation. NMIXX and KorFinSTS provide robust tools for financial representation learning.

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a tool for testing structure-function relationships in cognitive processes and enable systematic investigations of activation dynamics in knowledge modeling.

Method: Numerical simulations of spreading activation in single-layer and multiplex networks, validated through case studies comparing results with grounded theories.

Result: Case studies demonstrate SpreadPy's utility in distinguishing math anxiety levels, analyzing cognitive load in creativity tasks, and correlating activation patterns with clinical impairments in aphasia.

Conclusion: SpreadPy offers a flexible framework for modeling cognitive processes, supporting reproducible research and mechanistic insights into individual differences and impairments.

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRPO to improve Thai legal LLMs, achieving better citation accuracy and response quality with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of RAG systems in Thai legal question answering, especially for complex legal reasoning.

Method: Uses Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with BGE-M3 embeddings for cost-efficient semantic-similarity rewards.

Result: Achieves 90% citation-F1 gains and 31% joint quality improvement over instruction tuning on NitiBench.

Conclusion: GRPO is a resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs, especially for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

### [242] [MCEval: A Dynamic Framework for Fair Multilingual Cultural Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09701)
*Shulin Huang,Linyi Yang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCEval is a multilingual framework evaluating cultural awareness and bias in large language models (LLMs) across 13 cultures and languages, revealing disparities and fairness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address cultural biases and limited cross-cultural understanding in LLMs serving diverse global users.

Method: Uses dynamic cultural question construction, Counterfactual Rephrasing, and Confounder Rephrasing for causal analysis.

Result: Identifies performance disparities and fairness issues, showing language-culture alignment impacts cultural performance.

Conclusion: MCEval is the first comprehensive multilingual framework offering insights into LLMs' cultural understanding.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

### [243] [Large Language Models Encode Semantics in Low-Dimensional Linear Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09709)
*Baturay Saglam,Paul Kassianik,Blaine Nelson,Sajana Weerawardhena,Yaron Singer,Amin Karbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the latent space geometry of LLMs, revealing that high-level semantic information is organized in low-dimensional, linearly separable subspaces, enabling effective interventions and tools for alignment and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally organize semantic representations and leverage this for improving model alignment and safety.

Method: A large-scale empirical study of hidden states in 11 decoder-only transformer models across 6 topics and 12 layers, analyzing separability and interventions.

Result: Semantic information forms linearly separable subspaces, especially in deeper layers and under structured prompts. This enables simple causal interventions (e.g., capturing chain-of-thought reasoning with a single vector).

Conclusion: The findings support geometry-aware tools for detecting and mitigating harmful content, demonstrated by a lightweight MLP classifier for adversarial prompt detection.

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

### [244] [Your Pretrained Model Tells the Difficulty Itself: A Self-Adaptive Curriculum Learning Paradigm for Natural Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09758)
*Qi Feng,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-adaptive curriculum learning method uses PLM-predicted difficulty scores to order training examples, outperforming random sampling in NLU tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curriculum learning relies on manual difficulty metrics, which may not align with the model's perspective.

Method: Uses PLMs to predict difficulty scores and explores easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, and mixed training strategies.

Result: Faster convergence and improved performance on NLU tasks compared to random sampling.

Conclusion: Self-adaptive curriculum learning enhances training efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

*Gabriel Mordecki,Guillermo Moncecchi,Javier Couto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revises the definition of clickbait, focusing on the curiosity gap, and introduces a new dataset (TA1C) for clickbait detection in Spanish with strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the definition of clickbait and reduce subjectivity in its detection by emphasizing the curiosity gap.

Method: Proposes a refined definition of clickbait, creates a new dataset (TA1C) with clear annotation criteria, and implements baseline models for detection.

Result: TA1C dataset achieves 0.825 Fleiss' K agreement, and baseline models reach 0.84 F1-score.

Conclusion: The study provides a clearer definition of clickbait and a reliable dataset for future research in Spanish clickbait detection.

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

### [246] [Function Induction and Task Generalization: An Interpretability Study with Off-by-One Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09875)
*Qinyuan Ye,Robin Jia,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models generalize to unseen tasks like off-by-one addition, uncovering a function induction mechanism and parallel attention heads driving the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms enabling task-level generalization in large language models, particularly for counterfactual tasks like off-by-one addition.

Method: Uses circuit-style interpretability techniques (e.g., path patching) to analyze model computations.

Result: Identifies a function induction mechanism, parallel attention heads governing the +1 function, and reuse of this mechanism in other tasks.

Conclusion: Reveals reusable and composable structures in language models that facilitate task-level generalization.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

### [247] [Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Text Segmentation Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09935)
*Hai Toan Nguyen,Tien Dat Nguyen,Viet Ha Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework improves RAG systems by using hierarchical text segmentation and clustering for better semantic chunking, outperforming traditional methods on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chunking in RAG systems often lacks semantic coherence due to ignoring textual structure, limiting retrieval effectiveness.

Method: The framework integrates hierarchical text segmentation and clustering to create semantically meaningful chunks, using segment-level and cluster-level vectors for retrieval.

Result: Evaluations on NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets show improved performance over traditional chunking techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances RAG systems by generating more precise and contextually relevant chunks, improving retrieval quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

TL;DR: TinyRM, a small bidirectional MLM with 400M parameters, rivals larger models in RLHF reward modeling, using FLAN prompting, DoRA, and layer freezing for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high inference costs of large decoder-based models in RLHF by developing smaller, efficient alternatives.

Method: Uses TinyRM, combining FLAN-style prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing.

Result: TinyRM matches performance of models 175x larger on reasoning and safety preference tasks, with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Lightweight bidirectional architectures like TinyRM show promise as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling, though challenges remain in generalist models and conversational tasks.

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

*Hang Yuan,Chen Li,Wenjun Ma,Yuncheng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextOmics is a benchmark for aligning omics expressions with molecular textual descriptions, enabling hit-like molecular generation. ToDi, a framework built on TextOmics, outperforms existing methods in generating biologically relevant molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations hinders target-specific drug discovery.

Method: TextOmics provides a dataset for molecular generation. ToDi uses two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) and conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation.

Result: ToDi outperforms state-of-the-art methods and shows potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Conclusion: TextOmics and ToDi bridge the gap in molecular generation, offering a robust solution for drug discovery.

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

### [250] [Protective Factor-Aware Dynamic Influence Learning for Suicide Risk Prediction on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10008)
*Jun Li,Xiangmeng Wang,Haoyang Li,Yifei Yan,Hong Va Leong,Ling Feng,Nancy Xiaonan Yu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework predicts suicide risk by analyzing dynamic influences of risk and protective factors, outperforming existing models and offering interpretable insights for clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks models for predicting suicide risk over time and ignores protective factors, which are crucial for accurate risk assessment and intervention.

Method: Proposes a Protective Factor-Aware Dataset from Reddit posts and a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach to capture fluctuating impacts of risk and protective factors.

Result: The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models, providing interpretable weights for clinical use.

Conclusion: The framework enhances suicide risk prediction by integrating dynamic factors, aiding targeted interventions and improving understanding of suicidal patterns.

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

*David Ponce,Thierry Etchegoyhen,Javier Del Ser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeLaCo introduces an evolutionary approach for compressing LLMs via layer collapse, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment barriers due to high computational demands; model compression is needed to mitigate this.

Method: GeLaCo uses population-based search and a similarity fitness function to explore compression solutions, supporting single and multi-objective optimization.

Result: GeLaCo outperforms alternatives in perplexity-based and generative evaluations.

Conclusion: GeLaCo effectively compresses LLMs while maintaining performance, establishing a Pareto frontier for compression and quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

### [252] [Cultural Bias in Large Language Models: Evaluating AI Agents through Moral Questionnaires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10073)
*Simon Münker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs homogenize moral diversity, failing to represent varied cultural moral frameworks, and larger models don't improve cultural fidelity. This challenges their use in social science and AI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs accurately represent diverse human moral values or merely average them, highlighting gaps in AI alignment.

Method: Applied the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultures, comparing LLM outputs to human baseline data.

Result: LLMs systematically flatten moral diversity, with no consistent improvement from larger models.

Conclusion: Current AI alignment lacks nuanced cultural representation, necessitating better objectives and metrics.

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

*Chenxi Huang,Shaotian Yan,Liang Xie,Binbin Lin,Sinan Fan,Yue Xin,Deng Cai,Chen Shen,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRFT improves reasoning tasks by dynamically optimizing critical representations identified via information flow analysis, outperforming native ReFT and boosting few-shot accuracy by 16.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native ReFT's fixed-position representation edits yield suboptimal performance in complex reasoning tasks, prompting the need to identify and optimize critical representations.

Method: CRFT identifies critical representations through information flow analysis and optimizes them in a low-rank subspace while freezing the base model.

Result: CRFT outperforms native ReFT across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, with significant gains in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: CRFT demonstrates the potential of representation-level optimization for reasoning tasks, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods.

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

### [254] [Fusing Large Language Models with Temporal Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10098)
*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Qinyu Liu,Jun Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Transformer-based architecture integrates LLMs and vanilla Transformers for time series forecasting, combining semantic and temporal patterns for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in text tasks but underperform in time series forecasting due to gaps between text and numerical data. Vanilla Transformers lack semantic understanding.

Method: A hybrid model fuses representations from LLMs (semantic patterns) and vanilla Transformers (temporal dynamics) for enhanced forecasting.

Result: Experiments show the hybrid model outperforms standalone LLMs and vanilla Transformers in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively combines semantic and temporal insights, improving time series forecasting performance.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

### [255] [Task-Based Flexible Feature Distillation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10155)
*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel task-based feature distillation method for LLMs eliminates the need for shared hidden sizes or additional parameters, improving performance over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature distillation methods limit student architecture flexibility and degrade performance by requiring shared hidden sizes or introducing extra parameters.

Method: The proposed method identifies task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their activations to the student, avoiding new parameters.

Result: Empirical results show up to a 3% performance gain over baselines in tasks like classification, instruction-following, and summarization.

Conclusion: The method offers a flexible, parameter-free solution for knowledge distillation between models with differing architectures, enhancing downstream task performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs like Gemini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, and Groq to transform abusive text into non-abusive versions while retaining intent, sentiment, and semantics. Groq's results differ significantly from others, while GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 show similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLMs' effectiveness for classifying and transforming abusive text into non-abusive versions while preserving intent.

Method: Evaluate LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Groq) on abusive text transformation, then analyze raw and transformed datasets with sentiment and semantic analysis.

Result: Groq's results differ notably from other LLMs, while GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 exhibit similarities in performance.

Conclusion: LLMs can transform abusive text effectively, but performance varies, with Groq standing out and GPT-4o/DeepSeek-V3 showing comparable results.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Result: Identified performance gaps, especially in cultural inference and contextual understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methods to enhance LLMs for Arabic applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

TL;DR: An evolutionary search approach for automated discrete prompt optimization outperforms state-of-the-art methods on smaller LLMs for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of prompt engineering for complex tasks and smaller models, which are more sensitive to prompt design.

Method: Two-phase approach: grammar-guided genetic programming for prompt synthesis and local search for fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt on smaller LLMs in domain-specific tasks with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes prompts for smaller models in complex tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

### [259] [Bridging Robustness and Generalization Against Word Substitution Attacks in NLP via the Growth Bound Matrix Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10330)
*Mohammed Bouri,Adnane Saoud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to enhance NLP model robustness against adversarial attacks, focusing on LSTM, S4, and CNN architectures, achieving up to 8.8% improvement in robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the robustness of recurrent networks and state space models (SSMs) like S4 is understudied.

Method: A novel regularization technique using GBM is proposed to mitigate input perturbations, applied to LSTM, S4, and CNN architectures.

Result: The method improves adversarial robustness by up to 8.8% and outperforms state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: GBM effectively enhances NLP model robustness and provides the first systematic analysis of S4 robustness.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4 show strong alignment with human judgements in linguistic tasks, validating their use as reliable tools in linguistic research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can replicate nuanced human judgements in linguistic research, particularly in affective meanings of temporal expressions.

Method: Four psycholinguistic studies comparing human and LLM responses on tasks like emergent meanings, valence shifts, and sentence-emoji associations.

Result: High correlations (Spearman's rho = .73-.96) between human and LLM responses, with minor divergences not affecting interpretative outcomes.

Conclusion: LLMs can augment human-based linguistic research, enabling scalable studies without losing validity, and serve as credible collaborators.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

*Silvia Cappa,Anna Sofia Lippolis,Stefano Zoia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A stratified model for metaphor processing is proposed, treating meaning as a multi-layered structure with content analysis, conceptual blending, and pragmatic intentionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of metaphorical meaning beyond flat mappings, integrating cognitive and pragmatic dimensions.

Method: A three-dimensional framework: (1) content analysis, (2) conceptual blending, (3) pragmatic intentionality, unified into a formal model.

Result: Enables richer, context-sensitive computational metaphor interpretation.

Conclusion: The model advances computational metaphor understanding by integrating layered meaning and pragmatic context.

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can solve graph reasoning tasks by identifying substructures in textual descriptions. The paper introduces Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF) to explain how decoder-only Transformers understand graph structures and demonstrates their capability in handling diverse graph types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how decoder-only Transformers interpret graph structures embedded in text and perform substructure extraction tasks.

Method: Introduces Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF) to analyze substructure identification in multi-layer transformers, validated empirically and theoretically. Explores broader graph-handling capabilities, including complex composite patterns and attributed graphs.

Result: LLMs consistently identify substructures across layers, and decoder-only Transformers can efficiently extract substructures from attributed graphs like molecular graphs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how sequence-based Transformers perform substructure extraction, highlighting their potential in graph reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

*Chris Madge,Matthew Purver,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues, comparing human and LLM behavior in handling ambiguity. It introduces a new corpus for analysis and finds weak links between ambiguity and clarification questions, with notable differences between humans and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle ambiguity in dialogues compared to humans, and to explore the role of reasoning in their question-asking behavior.

Method: A new corpus combining existing annotations is created. Human and LLM clarification questions are compared, and reasoning approaches are tested to assess their impact.

Result: Humans rarely ask clarification questions for referential ambiguity but often for task uncertainty, while LLMs do the opposite. Reasoning improves LLMs' question frequency and relevancy.

Conclusion: LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is influenced by reasoning, but their behavior differs significantly from humans, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

TL;DR: The study compares classic bidirectional transformer encoders and ultra-large autoregressive LLMs for hate-speech detection to see if larger models improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online platforms need effective hate-speech detection without over-censoring legitimate content.

Method: Benchmarking both classic encoders and next-generation LLMs on curated hate-speech corpora.

Result: The study evaluates whether larger models enhance practical hate-speech detection.

Conclusion: Findings will verify if ultra-large LLMs outperform classic encoders in real-world hate-speech detection.

Abstract: Online platforms struggle to curb hate speech without over-censoring
legitimate discourse. Early bidirectional transformer encoders made big
strides, but the arrival of ultra-large autoregressive LLMs promises deeper
context-awareness. Whether this extra scale actually improves practical
hate-speech detection on real-world text remains unverified. Our study puts
this question to the test by benchmarking both model families, classic encoders
and next-generation LLMs, on curated corpora of online interactions for
hate-speech detection (Hate or No Hate).

TL;DR: MLAR, an RPA-enhanced ATS using LLMs, automates resume screening with three layers: job posting extraction, resume parsing, and similarity matching, outperforming UiPath and Automation Anywhere in speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bottlenecks in traditional recruitment processes like resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource constraints.

Method: Uses LLMs in three layers: job posting extraction, resume parsing, and similarity matching, integrated into RPA pipelines.

Result: Processes 2,400 resumes at 5.4 seconds per resume, 16.9% faster than Automation Anywhere and 17.1% faster than UiPath.

Conclusion: MLAR offers an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for modern recruitment needs.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and
scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

*İsmail Tarım,Aytuğ Onan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares diffusion-generated (LLaDA) and autoregressive-generated (LLaMA) text, showing LLaDA mimics human text better, challenging current detectors. It calls for diffusion-aware detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in detecting AI-generated text from diffusion models, as current methods focus on autoregressive models.

Method: Systematic comparison of 2,000 samples from LLaDA and LLaMA using metrics like perplexity, burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores.

Result: LLaDA mimics human text closely in perplexity and burstiness, while LLaMA has lower perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Single metrics fail to distinguish diffusion outputs from human writing.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for diffusion-aware detectors and suggests hybrid models, diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking as future directions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) combines parameter sharing and adaptive computation in a Recursive Transformer, improving efficiency and performance across model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational and memory costs of scaling language models by unifying parameter sharing and adaptive computation.

Method: Introduces MoR, a framework with shared layers across recursion steps and lightweight routers for adaptive token-level recursion depths, plus KV sharing for reduced latency.

Result: MoR achieves lower perplexity, better few-shot accuracy, and higher throughput compared to baselines, forming a new Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: MoR effectively delivers large-model quality without the associated costs, making it a promising efficiency solution.

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs as judges in coding tasks, finding that thinking models outperform non-thinking ones but exhibit randomness and sensitivity to response order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dedicated benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as judges in coding tasks, such as code generation, repair, and unit test generation.

Method: Introduces CodeJudgeBench to evaluate 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models across three coding tasks, analyzing performance, randomness, and prompting strategies.

Result: Thinking models outperform non-thinking ones, but all models show randomness and sensitivity to response order. Pairwise comparison and retaining comments improve judging performance.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge models are promising but unreliable due to randomness and sensitivity, requiring careful prompting strategies for optimal performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REST is a stress-testing framework for evaluating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) under multi-context pressure, revealing performance gaps and mechanistic insights not captured by single-question benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LRMs are limited by isolated problem-solving paradigms, failing to assess real-world capabilities like contextual priority allocation and cross-problem interference resistance.

Method: REST concurrently exposes LRMs to multiple problems, evaluating under-tested capabilities such as dynamic cognitive load management.

Result: State-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 show significant performance degradation under REST, with the framework demonstrating stronger discriminative power than single-question benchmarks.

Conclusion: REST provides a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands and reduces reliance on continuous human annotation.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent Expansion (RE) introduces a behavior-aware learning paradigm, extending beyond static data learning in DL by analyzing evolving model behaviors for self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static data representations in DL by incorporating insights from model behaviors and performance signals.

Method: RE uses multiple mappings of data through identical architectures, analyzing feature maps and performance signals. Variants like MVRE, HMVRE, and Sc-HMVRE introduce parallel and heterogeneous model aggregation.

Result: RE enables iterative self-improvement and scalable, adaptive AI systems by reasoning over learning dynamics.

Conclusion: RE shifts DL toward behavior-aware, self-evolving systems, paving the way for introspective and adaptive AI.

Abstract: This paper introduces Recurrent Expansion (RE) as a new learning paradigm
that advances beyond conventional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
While DL focuses on learning from static data representations, RE proposes an
additional dimension: learning from the evolving behavior of models themselves.
RE emphasizes multiple mappings of data through identical deep architectures
and analyzes their internal representations (i.e., feature maps) in conjunction
with observed performance signals such as loss. By incorporating these
behavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model
version to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended
through Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model
instances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of
varying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive
variant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for
real-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely
representational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the
groundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over
their own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,
and adaptive artificial intelligence. A simple code example to support
beginners in running their own experiments is provided in Code Availability
Section of this paper.

*Kimia Soroush,Nastaran Shirazi,Mohsen Raji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient TMR method using XAI (specifically LRP) to selectively protect critical DNN weights against bit-flip faults, improving reliability by over 60% with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring DNN reliability in safety-critical domains is crucial, and TMR is effective but costly. Selective application of TMR based on parameter importance can optimize efficiency.

Method: Uses gradient-based XAI (LRP) to score DNN parameters, applying TMR selectively to the most critical weights. Evaluated on VGG16 and AlexNet with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Result: Achieves over 60% reliability improvement for AlexNet at a bit error rate of 10-4, matching overhead of existing methods.

Conclusion: The XAI-based TMR approach effectively enhances DNN reliability against bit-flip faults with minimal overhead, making it suitable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains,
where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of
bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is
applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest
contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection
criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an
efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip
faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can
provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and
weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection
metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,
gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to
enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being
protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16
and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate
that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4,
achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead
as state-of-the-art methods.

navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the
digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel
decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique
synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a
hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random
Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and
real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast
market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts
the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?",
providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is
delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada
language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech
synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results
show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability
prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low
margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized
recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and
impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming
communities.

*Seokmin Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA reduces parameters for LLM fine-tuning but lacks consistent speed improvements. The paper analyzes LoRA's limitations and proposes more efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistency in LoRA's speed improvements across models and setups.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and proposal of new efficient fine-tuning methods.

Result: Proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance with more consistent speed improvements.

Conclusion: Provides insights and guidelines for optimizing LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

TL;DR: A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework is introduced to simulate pollutant dispersion in oceans, overcoming challenges of traditional methods by embedding physical laws and noisy synthetic data into training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods struggle with modeling pollutant transport in large, dynamic oceanic domains due to complexity and scale.

Method: The PINN framework uses a hybrid loss function combining PDE residuals, boundary/initial conditions, and data fit, trained on noisy synthetic data generated via finite difference methods.

Result: The model achieves physically consistent predictions and addresses non-linear dynamics and boundary condition enforcement effectively.

Conclusion: The PINN approach, leveraging Julia's ecosystem, offers a scalable and flexible alternative to traditional solvers for pollutant dispersion modeling.

Abstract: Traditional numerical methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of
modeling pollutant transport across vast and dynamic oceanic domains. This
paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to simulate
the dispersion of pollutants governed by the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
The model achieves physically consistent predictions by embedding physical laws
and fitting to noisy synthetic data, generated via a finite difference method
(FDM), directly into the neural network training process. This approach
addresses challenges such as non-linear dynamics and the enforcement of
boundary and initial conditions. Synthetic data sets, augmented with varying
noise levels, are used to capture real-world variability. The training
incorporates a hybrid loss function including PDE residuals, boundary/initial
condition conformity, and a weighted data fit term. The approach takes
advantage of the Julia language scientific computing ecosystem for
high-performance simulations, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to
traditional solvers

*Harold Guéneau,Alain Celisse,Pascal Delange*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based method for money laundering detection uses contrastive learning and a two-thresholds approach to control false positives, outperforming rule-based and LSTM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve money laundering detection by leveraging structured time series data with minimal supervision.

Method: Uses a transformer neural network with contrastive learning for unsupervised representation learning, followed by a scoring system with Benjamini-Hochberg for false-positive control.

Result: The method effectively detects fraudsters and nonfraudsters with controlled false positives, outperforming rule-based and LSTM approaches.

Conclusion: The transformer-based approach is superior for money laundering detection, requiring less expert supervision and offering better performance.

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new
procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both
qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The
first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series
through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages
these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all
observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a
controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general
representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with
minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability
of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while
keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with
rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models
(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The
intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the
current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization
step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to
potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the
denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that
reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single
approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on
widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL
methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers
additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer
function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with
the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),
position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying
RL to dLLMs reasoning.

TL;DR: Proposes a Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) to adapt knowledge from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to improve Lewy Body Disease (LBD) diagnosis, addressing data scarcity and domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBD is understudied and shares similarities with AD, but data scarcity and domain shift hinder effective diagnosis. Leveraging abundant AD data could help.

Method: Uses a Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) with structural connectivity (SC) from MRI, focusing on disease-transferable features and suppressing domain-specific ones.

Result: TAT effectively reduces domain shift and improves LBD diagnostic accuracy despite limited data.

Conclusion: First study to adapt AD knowledge for LBD diagnosis under data scarcity and domain shift, offering a framework for rare disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that
imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD
diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In
contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge
transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites
using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.
To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a
Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to
enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived
from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT
adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while
suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving
diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity
and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis
of rare diseases.

TL;DR: A novel training-free proxy, WRCor, improves neural architecture search (NAS) efficiency by using weighted response correlation to estimate architectures, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot NAS methods lack effectiveness, stability, and generality, prompting the need for a better training-free proxy.

Method: Proposes WRCor, a training-free proxy using correlation coefficient matrices of responses to measure architecture expressivity and generalizability.

Result: WRCor and its voting proxies outperform existing methods in efficiency and effectiveness, achieving a 22.1% test error on ImageNet-1k in 4 GPU hours.

Conclusion: WRCor is a superior zero-shot NAS method, offering faster and more accurate architecture estimation.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

*Zhufeng Lu,Chentao Jia,Ming Hu,Xiaofei Xie,Mingsong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRAS is a communication-efficient Federated Recommender System framework that reduces communication overhead and improves training efficiency by clustering gradients into actions, without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) face high communication overhead and low training efficiency due to massive item embeddings and heterogeneous environments. Existing compression methods degrade model performance.

Method: FedRAS uses an action-sharing strategy to cluster gradients into model updating actions for communication, avoiding direct compression of item embeddings. It includes an adaptive clustering mechanism for heterogeneous environments.

Result: FedRAS reduces communication payload size by up to 96.88% while maintaining recommendation performance across heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: FedRAS effectively addresses communication and efficiency challenges in FedRecs without compromising performance, and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated
Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender
systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from
two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive
item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low
training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network
environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ
various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the
parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from
model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,
this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,
which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item
embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication
rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud
server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since
gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining
the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors
compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.
To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS
incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate
that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,
while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous
scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at
https://github.com/mastlab-T3S/FedRAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout limit GNN scalability and efficiency.

Method: DAFOS uses node scoring (degree-based) to focus resources on important nodes, incrementally adjusts fanout, and includes early stopping.

Result: Achieves 3.57x-12.6x speedup and improves F1 scores (e.g., 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv).

Conclusion: DAFOS is an efficient, scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from
graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout
settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel
approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and
prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node
scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally
important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses.
DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when
performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets,
ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a
state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv
dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score
from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the
ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of
DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and assurance challenges in RL-integrated CPS, as existing methods lack systematic safety guarantees.

Method: Adapting the AMLAS methodology to RL, creating AMLAS-RL for iterative safety assurance.

Result: AMLAS-RL provides a structured approach to safety assurance in RL-enabled systems, validated with a wheeled vehicle case.

Conclusion: AMLAS-RL effectively bridges the gap in safety assurance for RL in CPS, offering a practical framework.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing
integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS
offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant
safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning
(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,
dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and
environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in
safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective
but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating
safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic
assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured
guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does
not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we
adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an
RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate
AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a
target goal without collision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods in conformal prediction settings, focusing on data-limited scenarios.

Method: Comparison of TSFMs with statistical models and gradient boosting in conformal prediction, evaluating predictive accuracy and calibration stability.

Result: TSFMs provide more reliable prediction intervals and stable calibration, especially with limited data, outperforming traditional models.

Conclusion: Foundation models enhance conformal prediction reliability in time series, particularly in data-constrained cases.

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series
forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the
available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the
performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods,
including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal
prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First,
when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized
prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive
accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are
used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced
these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data
for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation
models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series
applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics (AUC, F1-score) fail to reflect financial outcomes, potentially misleading strategic decisions in retention campaigns.

Method: e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for personalized retention rates and evaluates models per customer, benchmarking six classifiers on telecom datasets.

Result: e-Profits reshapes model rankings, highlighting financial advantages in overlooked models and providing segment-level insights for high-value customers.

Conclusion: e-Profits is a practical, post hoc tool for profit-driven model evaluation, aiding marketing and analytics teams.

Abstract: Retention campaigns in customer relationship management often rely on churn
prediction models evaluated using traditional metrics such as AUC and F1-score.
However, these metrics fail to reflect financial outcomes and may mislead
strategic decisions. We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned
evaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific
value, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing
profit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed
population-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to
estimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer
evaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco
and Maven Telecom) and demonstrate that e-Profits reshapes model rankings
compared to traditional metrics, revealing financial advantages in models
previously overlooked by AUC or F1-score. The metric also enables segment-level
insight into which models maximise return on investment for high-value
customers. e-Profits is designed as an understandable, post hoc tool to support
model evaluation in business contexts, particularly for marketing and analytics
teams prioritising profit-driven decisions. All source code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper proposes lower bounds for message-passing iterations in GNNs solving PDEs, reducing hyperparameter tuning needs. Bounds are derived for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic PDEs, linking physical problem characteristics to GNN requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of hyperparameter tuning in GNNs for PDEs by establishing theoretical lower bounds for message-passing iterations.

Method: Derives bounds by relating physical constants, discretization, and GNN message-passing mechanisms for three PDE classes.

Result: Shows that below the bounds, GNNs perform poorly; meeting them ensures accurate solutions. Examples validate the bounds' sharpness.

Conclusion: The proposed bounds effectively guide GNN parameterization for accurate PDE solutions, reducing tuning efforts.

Abstract: This paper proposes sharp lower bounds for the number of message passing
iterations required in graph neural networks (GNNs) when solving partial
differential equations (PDE). This significantly reduces the need for
exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Bounds are derived for the three fundamental
classes of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic) by relating the physical
characteristics of the problem in question to the message-passing requirement
of GNNs. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the physical
constants of the equations governing the problem, the spatial and temporal
discretisation and the message passing mechanisms in GNNs.
  When the number of message passing iterations is below these proposed limits,
information does not propagate efficiently through the network, resulting in
poor solutions, even for deep GNN architectures. In contrast, when the
suggested lower bound is satisfied, the GNN parameterisation allows the model
to accurately capture the underlying phenomenology, resulting in solvers of
adequate accuracy.
  Examples are provided for four different examples of equations that show the
sharpness of the proposed lower bounds.

TL;DR: The paper studies data biases in AI, identifying three common types and their impact on algorithmic discrimination. It introduces the Data Bias Profile (DBP) for systematic bias detection and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of data biases in AI, which drives algorithmic discrimination, and bridge the gap between fairness research and policy.

Method: Analyzes three data biases, their individual and joint effects, and develops the DBP for detection and mitigation. Tests effectiveness using fairness datasets.

Result: Underrepresentation is less critical than proxies and label bias. DBP effectively predicts discriminatory risks and aids fairness interventions.

Conclusion: The DBP offers a systematic approach to documenting biases, linking fairness research with anti-discrimination policy.

Abstract: Undesirable biases encoded in the data are key drivers of algorithmic
discrimination. Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic
fairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on
anti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain
understudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for
their detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data
biases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic
discrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We
find that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is
less conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while
combinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently,
we develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine
them into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP).
This initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias
signals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular
fairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting
the risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing
interventions. Overall, this article bridges algorithmic fairness research and
anti-discrimination policy through a data-centric lens.

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling

self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to
high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding

*Xishun Liao,Haoxuan Ma,Yifan Liu,Yuxiang Wei,Brian Yueshuai He,Chris Stanford,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based travel demand modeling framework is introduced, offering a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional activity-based models, validated in Los Angeles with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activity-based models (ABMs) are costly, inflexible, and rely on simplified assumptions, prompting the need for a more efficient, adaptable solution.

Method: The framework integrates population synthesis, activity generation, location assignment, and traffic simulation into a unified, generative system.

Result: The model replicates real-world mobility patterns closely, outperforming legacy ABMs with reduced cost and scalability (e.g., 0.97 cosine similarity for OD matrix).

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a viable, scalable alternative to traditional ABMs, validated by high accuracy metrics in Los Angeles.

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility
system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in
behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are
costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper
presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes
household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's
socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population
synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and
large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully
generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A
full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million
population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates
real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with
significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to
the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine
similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network
yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans
PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001
JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

*Shaoran Yang,Dongyu Wei,Hanzhi Yu,Zhaohui Yang,Yuchen Liu,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CLIP-based semantic communication framework eliminates the need for joint training, uses PPO-based RL for optimization, and outperforms soft actor-critic in convergence and rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable semantic communication without joint training and optimize performance in noisy wireless networks.

Method: Uses CLIP model for semantic encoding/decoding and PPO-based RL for joint optimization of model architecture and RB allocation.

Result: Improves convergence rate by 40% and accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient for semantic communication in noisy wireless environments.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model
based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural
network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and
decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model
based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a
transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural
network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for
follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.
Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework
over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the
CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic
information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP
model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize
semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay
and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a
proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus
finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that
our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the
accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VIPEEGNet, a CNN model, achieves high accuracy in EEG-based brain activity classification, performing comparably to human experts and outperforming many existing algorithms with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in EEG-based brain disease diagnosis, such as inter-rater variability and poor AI generalizability.

Method: Developed and validated VIPEEGNet using two independent EEG datasets (1950 and 1532 patients) with expert annotations.

Result: Achieved high AUROC (0.930-0.972) for binary classification and competitive multi-class performance (sensitivity: 36.8%-88.2%, precision: 55.6%-80.4%). External validation ranked top 2 among 2767 algorithms.

Conclusion: VIPEEGNet is a highly accurate and efficient tool for EEG-based brain activity classification, with potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Timely identification of harmful brain activities via electroencephalography
(EEG) is critical for brain disease diagnosis and treatment, which remains
limited application due to inter-rater variability, resource constraints, and
poor generalizability of existing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In this
study, a convolutional neural network model, VIPEEGNet, was developed and
validated using EEGs recorded from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard
Medical School. The VIPEEGNet was developed and validated using two independent
datasets, collected between 2006 and 2020. The development cohort included EEG
recordings from 1950 patients, with 106,800 EEG segments annotated by at least
one experts (ranging from 1 to 28). The online testing cohort consisted of EEG
segments from a subset of an additional 1,532 patients, each annotated by at
least 10 experts. For the development cohort (n=1950), the VIPEEGNet achieved
high accuracy, with an AUROC for binary classification of seizure, LPD, GPD,
LRDA, GRDA, and "other" categories at 0.972 (95% CI, 0.957-0.988), 0.962 (95%
CI, 0.954-0.970), 0.972 (95% CI, 0.960-0.984), 0.938 (95% CI, 0.917-0.959),
0.949 (95% CI, 0.941-0.957), and 0.930 (95% CI, 0.926-0.935). For multi
classification, the sensitivity of VIPEEGNET for the six categories ranges from
36.8% to 88.2% and the precision ranges from 55.6% to 80.4%, and performance
similar to human experts. Notably, the external validation showed
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)of 0.223 and 0.273, ranking top 2 among the
existing 2,767 competing algorithms, while we only used 2.8% of the parameters
of the first-ranked algorithm.

*Hanlong Zhang,Jingsheng Yang,Hao Li,Yuhao He,Franck Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ODIA accelerates LLM-based Function Calling by distilling knowledge from larger to smaller models, reducing latency by 45-78% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in LLM-based Function Calling negatively impacts user experience, necessitating a solution to reduce response times without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: ODIA identifies 'simple queries' from production traffic and distills knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, leveraging online user interaction data.

Result: Response latency reduced by 45% (expected) and 78% (median); smaller model handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: ODIA is a practical, automated solution for reducing latency in Function Calling, suitable for production environments with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high
latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user
experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation
for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to
accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from
production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones,
our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while
maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model
successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method
requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated
data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for
production environments.

### [293] [Last Layer Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08905)
*Koen Vellenga,H. Joe Steinhauer,Göran Falkman,Jonas Andersson,Anders Sjögren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LL-HMC applies Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to the last layer of DNNs for efficient uncertainty estimation, showing competitive performance in classification and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC is computationally expensive for large DNNs, so LL-HMC restricts sampling to the last layer to make it feasible for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: LL-HMC is compared against five probabilistic deep learning methods on video datasets, evaluating classification, calibration, and OOD detection.

Result: LL-HMC performs competitively in classification and OOD detection, with additional samples improving OOD detection but not classification.

Conclusion: LL-HMC is a viable method for probabilistic last layer estimation, though multiple chains or starting points do not consistently enhance results.

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a
probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is
widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the
computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large
DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can
be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number
of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the
required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a
DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited
computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last
layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world
video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution
classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we
performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant
on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results
show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD
detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve
the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple
chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

*Tomasz Szandala,Fatima Ezzeddine,Natalia Rusin,Silvia Giordano,Omran Ayoub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in deepfake detection by proposing Fair-FLIP, a post-processing method that enhances fairness without significantly compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection methods often exhibit biases across demographics, threatening public trust. This work aims to mitigate such biases while maintaining detection robustness.

Method: The authors introduce Fair-FLIP, a post-processing technique that reweights a model's final-layer inputs to reduce subgroup disparities, prioritizing low-variability inputs.

Result: Fair-FLIP improves fairness metrics by up to 30% with only a 0.25% reduction in accuracy compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Fair-FLIP effectively balances fairness and accuracy in deepfake detection, offering a practical solution to mitigate biases.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular,
yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to
public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high
predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes
such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair
deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust
detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing
approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising
(Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce
subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting
highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the
baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches
show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining
baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

*Qi He,Peiran Yu,Ziyi Chen,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes shuffling-type gradient methods, addressing their convergence without Lipschitz smoothness, and proposes a stepsize strategy to match best-known rates under weaker assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence guarantees for shuffling-type gradient methods often rely on Lipschitz smoothness, which is not met in many machine learning models. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Revisits convergence rates without Lipschitz smoothness, introduces a stepsize strategy, and proves convergence for nonconvex, strongly convex, and non-strongly convex cases under bounded variance.

Result: The proposed algorithm converges under weaker assumptions and matches best-known rates, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The work broadens the applicability of shuffling-type gradient methods, proving their efficacy under more general conditions.

Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity
and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence
guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the
Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine
learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To
address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient
methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the
shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions
but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its
applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex,
and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary
shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical
experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient
algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.

### [296] [Beyond Scores: Proximal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08956)
*Zhenghan Fang,Mateo Díaz,Sam Buchanan,Jeremias Sulam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM) use backward SDE discretization with proximal maps instead of scores, offering faster convergence and theoretical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon traditional score-based diffusion models by leveraging proximal maps for better sampling efficiency and accuracy.

Method: ProxDM uses backward discretization of SDEs with proximal maps, learned via proximal matching, to replace traditional score-based methods.

Result: Theoretically, ProxDM requires fewer steps for accurate sampling; empirically, it converges faster than score-matching methods.

Conclusion: ProxDM provides a more efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to conventional diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful
generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their
development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the
log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data
distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased
estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative,
backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the
score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results
in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with
them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that
$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting
discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL
divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve
significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to
conventional score-matching methods.

*Xiang Li,Xinyu Wang,Yifan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GNN-based method improves cross-platform ad recommendation by modeling user behavior, ad content, and platform features, achieving high AUC on Platform B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-platform ad recommendation accuracy by capturing user interest migration across platforms.

Method: Uses GNN for multi-dimensional modeling of user behavior, ad content, and platform features.

Result: Platform B achieved 0.937 AUC; Platforms A and C showed slight precision/recall drops due to uneven ad label distribution. Hyperparameter tuning improved model robustness.

Conclusion: The GNN-based method effectively captures user interest migration, with Platform B performing best. Hyperparameter adjustments enhance adaptability.

Abstract: In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement
recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement
recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user
behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns
of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences
semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context)
shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly
enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across
platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three
platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best
performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision
and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the
hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the
adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further
improved.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in masked discrete diffusion, showing early high guidance harms quality while late-stage guidance is more impactful. It identifies an implementation flaw causing imbalanced transitions and proposes a simple, effective fix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of guidance schedules in CFG for discrete diffusion and address observed quality issues in current implementations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of CFG in masked discrete diffusion, identifying flaws in current implementations, and proposing a novel guidance mechanism.

Result: Early high guidance harms quality; late-stage guidance is more effective. The proposed method improves sample quality with minimal code changes.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into CFG schedules, identifies implementation flaws, and offers a simple, effective solution for better discrete diffusion results.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional
generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and
recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically
analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role
of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling
(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage
guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation
for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The
analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These
implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as
unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the
quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the
analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically
applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the
transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)
distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method
is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is
empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete
diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

TL;DR: ToxBench is a large-scale AB-FEP dataset for ML in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, focusing on ERα. The DualBind model outperforms others, showing ML can approximate AB-FEP efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between ML's data constraints and physics-based methods' computational cost for accurate binding affinity prediction.

Method: Introduce ToxBench, a dataset with 8,770 ERα-ligand complexes and AB-FEP computed binding energies. Propose DualBind, a dual-loss ML model.

Result: DualBind outperforms state-of-the-art ML methods, achieving close approximation to AB-FEP at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: ToxBench and DualBind demonstrate ML's potential to efficiently approximate AB-FEP, aiding drug discovery and toxicity assessment.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery
and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate
predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data.
In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy
perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive
for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,
the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on
a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha
(ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with
binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against
experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping
ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further
benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind
model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding
energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of
DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the
computational cost.

TL;DR: PINNs simulate turbulent flows without grids or data, using algorithmic innovations to learn chaotic dynamics, accurately reproducing key flow statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional turbulent flow simulations are computationally expensive; PINNs offer a mesh-free, data-free alternative.

Method: Uses adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization to solve fluid equations directly.

Result: PINNs accurately reproduce energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses in turbulent flows.

Conclusion: Neural equation solvers can model complex chaotic systems, overcoming traditional computational limits.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

*Carson Dudley,Reiden Magdaleno,Christopher Harding,Marisa Eisenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGNNs combine mechanistic simulations and neural networks for robust, interpretable scientific modeling, outperforming traditional methods in prediction and inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of mechanistic models (lack of flexibility) and machine learning models (black-box nature, data dependency) in scientific modeling.

Method: Introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), pretrained on diverse synthetic data from mechanistic simulations.

Result: SGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks like COVID-19 forecasting, chemical yield prediction, and ecological forecasting, while also enabling interpretability.

Conclusion: SGNNs bridge the gap between scientific theory and deep learning, offering a flexible, interpretable modeling paradigm.

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer
interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine
learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer
unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

*Chenyu Wang,Cai Zhou,Sharut Gupta,Zongyu Lin,Stefanie Jegelka,Stephen Bates,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework to enhance diffusion models by aligning internal representations with pre-trained models, improving generation quality and training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed aligning diffusion model representations with pre-trained models improves generation quality, but lacked a systematic approach. This paper aims to formalize and enhance such guidance.

Method: The authors propose two strategies: (1) pairing examples with target representations (self-derived or synthetic) and learning a joint model, and (2) designing an optimal training curriculum balancing representation learning and generation.

Result: Experiments on image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks show superior performance and faster training (e.g., 23.3x speedup on ImageNet 256x256).

Conclusion: The framework effectively accelerates training and improves generation quality, demonstrating the value of systematic representation guidance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores how model leaderboards can be exploited to distribute poisoned models at scale, introducing TrojanClimb, a framework for injecting malicious behaviors while maintaining high leaderboard rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked vulnerability of model leaderboards as a channel for large-scale poisoning attacks in machine learning.

Method: Introduces TrojanClimb, a framework for embedding harmful functionalities (e.g., backdoors, bias) in models while ensuring competitive leaderboard performance. Tests across four modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech, and text-to-image.

Result: Demonstrates adversaries can achieve high leaderboard rankings while embedding harmful functionalities, exposing a critical vulnerability in the ML ecosystem.

Conclusion: Urges redesigning leaderboard evaluation mechanisms to detect malicious models and warns of risks in adopting unverified models.

Abstract: While poisoning attacks on machine learning models have been extensively
studied, the mechanisms by which adversaries can distribute poisoned models at
scale remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we shed light on how model
leaderboards -- ranked platforms for model discovery and evaluation -- can
serve as a powerful channel for adversaries for stealthy large-scale
distribution of poisoned models. We present TrojanClimb, a general framework
that enables injection of malicious behaviors while maintaining competitive
leaderboard performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four diverse
modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech and text-to-image,
showing that adversaries can successfully achieve high leaderboard rankings
while embedding arbitrary harmful functionalities, from backdoors to bias
injection. Our findings reveal a significant vulnerability in the machine
learning ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need to redesign leaderboard
evaluation mechanisms to detect and filter malicious (e.g., poisoned) models,
while exposing broader security implications for the machine learning community
regarding the risks of adopting models from unverified sources.

*Zhengxiao He,Huayu Li,Geng Yuan,William D. S. Killgore,Stuart F. Quan,Chen X. Chen,Ao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised deep learning model analyzes multi-modal signals (EEG, ECG, respiratory) to predict CVD risk, validated in large cohorts and improving traditional risk scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CVD risk assessment by leveraging multi-modal physiological signals and deep learning for personalized predictions.

Method: Developed a self-supervised deep learning model trained on 4,398 participants, validated externally on 1,093, using EEG, ECG, and respiratory signals to derive projection scores.

Result: ECG predicted CVD mortality; EEG predicted hypertension and CVD mortality. Combined with Framingham Risk Score, AUC improved (0.607-0.965). Validated robustly.

Conclusion: The framework generates individualized CVD risk scores from PSG data, potentially improving clinical risk assessment and personalized care.

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts
meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG),
Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on
data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting
embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation
was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code
is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The
projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across
modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident
cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were
predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals
added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with
the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,
achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across
different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the
external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed
framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.
The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into
clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaze-informed RLHF improves efficiency by using human gaze data for reward modeling and sparse reward distribution, achieving faster convergence with comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF is computationally expensive; leveraging human gaze data could enhance efficiency and performance.

Method: Two approaches: gaze-aware reward models and gaze-based sparse reward distribution at token level.

Result: Faster convergence with maintained or slightly improved performance, reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Human gaze is a valuable, underused signal for RLHF, offering a promising direction for efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models with
human preferences but is computationally expensive. We explore two approaches
that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models
and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our
experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence
while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing
computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human
gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing
to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.

*Amey Agrawal,Nitin Kedia,Anmol Agarwal,Jayashree Mohan,Nipun Kwatra,Souvik Kundu,Ramachandran Ramjee,Alexey Tumanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM inference evaluation methods, identifying common anti-patterns and proposing a framework for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methodologies for LLM inference systems are flawed, leading to misleading conclusions and hindering progress.

Method: The authors analyze recent systems to identify recurring anti-patterns in Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup, and Metric Design. They provide a checklist to avoid these issues.

Result: The study highlights how anti-patterns distort performance insights and demonstrates their impact through a case study on speculative decoding.

Conclusion: The paper offers a framework to improve LLM inference evaluation, ensuring reproducibility and aligning with real-world requirements.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has
yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis
reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental
flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true
performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a
comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring
anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,
and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM
inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode
operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict
temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common
anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate
engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to
represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial
performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.
To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from
our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these
anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the
practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing
speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is
easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these
anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation
methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,
and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving
beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

*Vaibhav Singh,Zafir Khalid,Edouard Oyallon,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel distributed pre-training method reduces memory demands by training small subnetworks on separate workers, avoiding inter-node activation communication and maintaining low bandwidth requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the heavy memory demands and high communication costs in distributed pre-training of large models.

Method: Proposes training small, structured subnetworks on separate workers, with two subnetwork construction strategies: stochastic block dropping and width-wise subnetwork construction.

Result: Stochastic block dropping outperforms width-wise construction, with a 20-40% memory reduction and no performance loss.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for efficient distributed training by reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory
demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication
costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory
requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate
workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation
communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or
lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We
evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of
ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed
training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique
consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously
explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior
performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks
having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our
approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in
performance.

*Yash Shah,Camila Gonzalez,Mohammad H. Abbasi,Qingyu Zhao,Kilian M. Pohl,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recursive MDN (R-MDN), a layer for deep learning models to handle confounders in continual learning, ensuring invariant feature representations and equitable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confounders cause spurious correlations and biased predictions. Existing methods like MDN address this in static models, but continual learning poses challenges due to changing confounder effects.

Method: R-MDN integrates into any deep learning architecture, using recursive least squares to update feature distributions dynamically, adapting to changing confounders.

Result: R-MDN reduces catastrophic forgetting and ensures equitable predictions across population groups in both static and continual learning settings.

Conclusion: R-MDN effectively mitigates confounder effects in continual learning, improving model fairness and adaptability.

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

### [309] [Behavioral Exploration: Learning to Explore via In-Context Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09041)
*Andrew Wagenmaker,Zhiyuan Zhou,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes behavioral exploration for autonomous agents, enabling fast online adaptation and expert-like exploration using a long-context generative model trained on expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human-like fast exploration/adaptation and slow, gradient-based algorithmic approaches in robotics and machine learning.

Method: Train a long-context generative model on expert demonstrations to predict actions based on past observations and exploratory behavior measures.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in simulated and real-world robotic tasks, showing adaptive, exploratory behavior.

Conclusion: Behavioral exploration enables agents to mimic experts and adapt quickly, offering a promising approach for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt
their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine
learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and
adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of
interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random
exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow
autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration
from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral
cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to
internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of
``expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert
demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert
actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how
``exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This
enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by
feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different
expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for
fast online adaptation and targeted, ``expert-like'' exploration. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and
manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks,
illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.

*Jingxiang Qu,Wenhan Gao,Yi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework improves Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) efficiency by replacing redundant steps with a closed-form Gaussian approximation, maintaining quality and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of long generative trajectories in GPGMs limit practical deployment despite their state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Identify a step where data becomes sufficiently Gaussian, then replace the remaining trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation, avoiding redundant steps.

Result: Substantial improvements in sample quality and computational efficiency across multiple data modalities.

Conclusion: The framework enhances GPGMs' efficiency without compromising training granularity or inference fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by
reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with
Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the
high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve
hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we
introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that
improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or
inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the
noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a
Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which
the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining
generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike
existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping
steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while
avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like'
distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate
substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.

*Thomas T. Zhang,Daniel Pfrommer,Nikolai Matni,Max Simchowitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses imitation learning in continuous dynamical systems, proposing minimal interventions like 'action chunking' and 'noise injection' to mitigate compounding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning in physical settings (e.g., robotics) is complex due to compounding errors, requiring advanced solutions beyond expert trajectories.

Method: Proposes 'action chunking' for stable systems and 'noise injection' for unstable systems to reduce compounding errors.

Result: The interventions align with modern robot learning practices and provide distinct benefits, drawing insights from control theory and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study bridges gaps between control theory and reinforcement learning, offering novel solutions for stable imitation learning in continuous systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous
state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete
settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and
popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous
driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the
compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform
stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential
compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled
trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or
data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably
mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.
When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e.,
predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is
possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during
expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern
robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects
they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both
control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel
considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered
in isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight delays cause financial and operational disruptions; improving prediction models can enhance passenger experience and reduce revenue loss.

Method: Combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model (QT-SimAM), validated using US and EU flight delay datasets.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.927 (US) and 0.826 (EU), with F1 scores of 0.932 and 0.791, respectively, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: QT-SimAM is an effective, end-to-end solution for accurate and generalizable flight delay prediction, aiding operational decisions and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing
major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience
and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise
and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to
as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from
the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM
(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927
and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the
EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an
effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed
model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks
can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

TL;DR: The paper extends the Generalized Projected Bellman Error (GPBE) to support multistep credit assignment in deep RL, outperforming existing methods like PPO and StreamQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-policy deep RL methods often diverge due to reliance on semi-gradient TD methods, while GTD methods, though stable, are underutilized.

Method: Extends GPBE for multistep credit assignment using λ-return, deriving three gradient-based methods with forward-view (experience replay) and backward-view (streaming) formulations.

Result: Proposed algorithms outperform PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and MinAtar environments.

Conclusion: The work advances stable and efficient off-policy learning in deep RL by combining GPBE with multistep credit assignment.

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning
(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient
temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are
consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like
Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely
been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman
Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear
function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,
which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In
this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit
assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based
methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view
formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation
compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and
MinAtar environments, respectively. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous-time neural framework for low-rank signal decomposition, unifying PCA and ICA through a contrast function, enabling applications to irregularly sampled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend low-rank decomposition methods like PCA and ICA to continuous-time signals and irregularly sampled data, where traditional methods fail.

Method: Proposes an implicit neural signal representation framework with a contrast function in the network loss to enforce statistical properties (decorrelation, independence) of source signals.

Result: The framework successfully unifies PCA and ICA in continuous settings, enabling decomposition of irregularly sampled signals and point clouds.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes low-rank decomposition to continuous domains, offering a flexible solution for non-traditional signal types.

Abstract: We generalize the low-rank decomposition problem, such as principal and
independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) for continuous-time vector-valued
signals and provide a model-agnostic implicit neural signal representation
framework to learn numerical approximations to solve the problem. Modeling
signals as continuous-time stochastic processes, we unify the approaches to
both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast
function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties
of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the
decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of
such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where
standard techniques are not applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand DPO's general principles due to its diverse applications, current momentum, and state-of-the-art variations.

Method: Establishes a connection between Savage's losses and stochastic choice theories, generalizing DPO's framework.

Result: The connection supports abstention, non-convex objectives, and extensions like margins and length corrections.

Conclusion: Understanding DPO's general principles helps avoid pitfalls and explore workarounds in its diverse applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: DejaVu exploits network delays to create temporal misalignments in multimodal fusion (MMF) for autonomous driving, degrading perception tasks. AION is proposed as a defense, achieving high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMF's reliance on precise temporal synchronization makes it vulnerable to attacks exploiting delays, degrading perception tasks like object detection and tracking.

Method: DejaVu introduces temporal misalignments via network delays. AION detects attacks using cross-modal temporal consistency, shared representation learning, and dynamic time warping.

Result: DejaVu reduces car detection mAP by 88.5% and MOTA by 73%. AION achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives.

Conclusion: AION is a robust defense against temporal misalignment attacks, demonstrating high detection accuracy across datasets and models.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous
driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and
efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal
synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle
temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream
MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different
models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced
sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while
object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a
single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to
88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy
(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense
patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal
alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal
shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path
of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our
thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with
low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it
as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2SRec2, a set-to-set recommendation framework for grocery e-commerce, addressing the limitations of traditional single-ingredient prediction methods by predicting multiple complementary ingredients and assessing basket completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recipe completion methods predict only one missing ingredient and ignore real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are needed, as well as relationships among missing ingredients.

Method: The authors reformulate basket completion as a set-to-set problem, proposing S2SRec2, a framework using a Set Transformer trained in a multitask learning paradigm to retrieve missing ingredients and assess basket completeness.

Result: Experiments show S2SRec2 outperforms single-target baselines, improving grocery shopping and culinary creativity.

Conclusion: S2SRec2 offers a promising approach for enhancing grocery e-commerce by addressing the limitations of traditional methods and improving the user experience.

Abstract: In grocery e-commerce, customers often build ingredient baskets guided by
dietary preferences but lack the expertise to create complete meals. Leveraging
recipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial
basket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe
completion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a
leave-one-out strategy. However, they fall short in two key aspects: (i) they
do not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are often
needed, and (ii) they overlook relationships among the missing ingredients
themselves. To address these limitations, we reformulate basket completion as a
set-to-set (S2S) recommendation problem, where an incomplete basket is input
into a system that predicts a set of complementary ingredients. We introduce
S2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set
Transformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm. S2SRec2 jointly
learns to (i) retrieve missing ingredients from the representation of existing
ones and (ii) assess basket completeness after prediction. These tasks are
optimized together, enforcing accurate retrieval and coherent basket
completion. Experiments on large-scale recipe datasets and qualitative analyses
show that S2SRec2 significantly outperforms single-target baselines, offering a
promising approach to enhance grocery shopping and inspire culinary creativity.

TL;DR: Eigenoptions in RL aid exploration and credit assignment, but online discovery can hinder learning. A method for learning option-values in deep RL is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if eigenoptions can accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL and evaluate their impact in tabular and pixel-based gridworlds.

Method: Investigate eigenoptions in model-free RL, propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function approximation in deep RL.

Result: Pre-specified eigenoptions aid exploration and credit assignment, but online discovery can bias learning. Termination conditions impact performance.

Conclusion: Eigenoptions show promise for credit assignment and exploration in RL, but their use is complex and context-dependent.

Abstract: Options, which impose an inductive bias toward temporal and hierarchical
structure, offer a powerful framework for reinforcement learning (RL). While
effective in sequential decision-making, they are often handcrafted rather than
learned. Among approaches for discovering options, eigenoptions have shown
strong performance in exploration, but their role in credit assignment remains
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether eigenoptions can
accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL, evaluating them in tabular and
pixel-based gridworlds. We find that pre-specified eigenoptions aid not only
exploration but also credit assignment, whereas online discovery can bias the
agent's experience too strongly and hinder learning. In the context of deep RL,
we also propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function
approximation, highlighting the impact of termination conditions on
performance. Our findings reveal both the promise and complexity of using
eigenoptions, and options more broadly, to simultaneously support credit
assignment and exploration in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPAWP, a framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning to enhance GNN performance and efficiency by reducing negative prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in GNNs like long training times and insufficient feature extraction by leveraging graph pre-training and prompts, while exploring their optimization potential.

Method: Introduces GPAWP, using importance assessment to hierarchically prune negative prompts, improving parameter efficiency.

Result: Experiments show GPAWP reduces parameters significantly while maintaining competitive performance in node classification.

Conclusion: GPAWP effectively optimizes graph prompts, enhancing GNN efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their
triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature
extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods
have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale
datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential
improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive
and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically
structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more
parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a
significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

### [320] [POIFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework for Accurate and Scalable Point-of-Interest Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09137)
*Nripsuta Ani Saxena,Shang-Ling Hsu,Mehul Shetty,Omar Alkhadra,Cyrus Shahabi,Abigail L. Horn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POIFormer is a Transformer-based framework for accurate POI attribution, addressing GPS inaccuracies and dense POI clustering by modeling spatial, temporal, contextual, and behavioral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate POI attribution is crucial for mobility analytics and urban planning but is hindered by GPS inaccuracies and high POI density.

Method: POIFormer uses Transformer's self-attention to model spatial proximity, visit timing, duration, POI semantics, and user/crowd behavior. It leverages past/future visits and crowd patterns via KDEs.

Result: POIFormer outperforms baselines in noisy, dense urban settings, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: POIFormer offers a practical, generalizable solution for POI attribution, suitable for real-world deployment across diverse data sources.

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a
foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and
urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS
inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and
the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues
can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius
in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient
for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce
\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and
efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited
spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly
models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and
duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from
user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's
self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these
dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future
visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral
patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,
efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture
supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts
while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it
practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world
mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines,
particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise
and dense POI clustering.

*Mengjie Chen,Ming Zhang,Cunquan Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolecBioNet is a graph-based framework integrating molecular and biomedical knowledge for improved, interpretable drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based DDI prediction methods treat drug pairs independently and fail to integrate biological networks and molecular structures, limiting mechanistic insights.

Method: MolecBioNet models drug pairs as unified entities, extracts subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs, and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs. It uses context-aware and attention-guided pooling strategies for interpretability.

Result: MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, validated by ablation studies and embedding visualizations.

Conclusion: The framework's unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration enhance DDI prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

*Zichen Liu,Guoji Fu,Chao Du,Wee Sun Lee,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Follow-The-Leader shallow model for continual reinforcement learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting, achieving strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) where agents forget previous tasks when learning new ones.

Method: Uses online world models with model predictive control for planning, ensuring immunity to forgetting with a proven regret bound.

Result: Outperforms deep world models with continual learning techniques, demonstrating continuous learning without forgetting.

Conclusion: The FTL Online Agent effectively solves CRL challenges, offering a robust solution for sequential task learning.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where
an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks
that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that
the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task,
known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this
challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a
Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which
we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any
reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by
construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$
under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest
online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally.
To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for
CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning
algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously
to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built
on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XiChen is a fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system that completes data assimilation to forecasting in 17 seconds, rivaling NWP systems with an 8.25-day lead time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven weather models depend on NWP systems for initial conditions, which are time-consuming. XiChen aims to eliminate this dependency.

Method: XiChen uses a pre-trained foundation model fine-tuned for data assimilation and forecasting, integrating 4D variational knowledge for accuracy.

Result: XiChen achieves a forecasting lead time of 8.25 days, matching operational NWP systems.

Conclusion: XiChen demonstrates the potential for fully AI-driven weather forecasting without relying on NWP systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant
potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models
rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition
preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce
XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather
forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to
medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is
built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting.
Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation
operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw
satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional
variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting
accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful
forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that
XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting
independent of NWP systems.

### [324] [Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211)
*Xinyue Liu,Xiao Peng,Shuyue Yan,Yuntian Chen,Dongxiao Zhang,Zhixiao Niu,Hui-Min Wang,Xiaogang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepX-GAN, a knowledge-informed deep generative model, simulates unseen climate extremes beyond historical records, revealing latent risks in vulnerable regions like MENA, Indo-Pakistan, and Central Africa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing records of climate extremes are incomplete, missing rare but plausible extremes, and spatial dependence is often overlooked, undervaluing synchronized hazards.

Method: Developed DeepX-GAN to capture spatial structure of rare extremes, enabling zero-shot simulation of unseen extremes (checkmate and stalemate types).

Result: Unseen extremes disproportionately affect vulnerable regions; future warming may shift hotspots, exposing blind spots in hazard planning.

Conclusion: Spatially adaptive policies are needed to anticipate emergent risks, not just extrapolate from history.

Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk,
missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel,
neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that
amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN
(Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial
Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture
the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of
DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical
experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen
extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate"
extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in
fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked.
Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous
complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes
disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic
readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could
expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots
in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights
critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need
to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots
rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.

### [325] [Warm Starts Accelerate Generative Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09212)
*Jonas Scholz,Richard E. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A warm-start model accelerates conditional generation by providing an informed prior, reducing the need for many function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative generative models are slow, often requiring hundreds of evaluations. The warm-start model aims to speed this up.

Method: Predicts an informed prior (N(mu, sigma)) conditioned on input context, reducing the generative process's distance. Uses a conditional normalization trick for compatibility.

Result: Achieves competitive results with only 11 function evaluations (vs. 1000-step baseline) in tasks like image inpainting.

Conclusion: The warm-start model is a simple, effective way to accelerate conditional generation without modifying existing models or samplers.

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constructive wavelet neural network (WNN) that improves accuracy and reduces computational costs by selecting initial bases based on frequency analysis and dynamically adding new bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WNNs face challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high computational costs, limiting their application. This study aims to address these issues.

Method: The method involves a frequency estimator to analyze unknown nonlinear functions and a wavelet-basis increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, optimizing computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates versatility in estimating static mappings, combining datasets, identifying time-varying mappings, and capturing nonlinear dependencies in real-time data.

Conclusion: The constructive WNN framework significantly improves computational efficiency and accuracy, with broad applicability in signal processing and time-series analysis.

Abstract: Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from
the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis.
However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high
computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a
constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing
new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the
first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select
appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by
estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel
constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis
increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving
computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary
time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The
framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating
unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets,
identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing
nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the
framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released
at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.

TL;DR: TPP-SD accelerates Transformer TPP sampling using speculative decoding, achieving 2-6× speedup while maintaining output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the need for rapid sequence sampling.

Method: Leverages a smaller draft model to generate candidate events, verified by a larger target model in parallel.

Result: Produces identical distributions as standard methods with 2-6× speedup.

Conclusion: TPP-SD effectively balances speed and accuracy for TPP sampling.

Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal
point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques
from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between
thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we
develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to
generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger
target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as
autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces
samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$
speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as
draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the
gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid
sequence sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed patch sizes limit budget-conscious deployment in production for spatiotemporal dynamics modeling.

Method: Proposes Convolutional Kernel Modulator (CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM) for dynamic patch size control, combined with cyclic patch-size rollout.

Result: Improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency in 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables inference-time patch-size tunability, offering a plug-and-play solution for compute-adaptive modeling in PDE surrogate tasks.

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major
limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two
lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator
(CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size
control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy
loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch
artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks.
Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach
improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based
PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across
architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling
in PDE surrogate tasks.

TL;DR: A framework for quantifying uncertainty in time series imputation, improving accuracy and downstream task performance by selectively imputing confident values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of uncertainty measures in existing imputation methods, especially in healthcare where unreliable imputations can have serious consequences.

Method: Introduces a general framework to quantify and leverage uncertainty for selective imputation, avoiding highly unreliable values.

Result: Demonstrated reduced imputation errors and improved performance in downstream tasks, such as 24-hour mortality prediction.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation enhances reliability and practical utility, particularly in healthcare.

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains.
Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor
disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is
critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack
mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general
framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation.
By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable
imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering
diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing
less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves
downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour
mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating
uncertainty into time series imputation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to generalize the concept of autoencoders to handle multiple classes dynamically evolving from each other, particularly useful in modeling natural evolution across species.

Method: The MAE is defined as a neural network that learns a compact representation and encoder/decoder for a family of class-specific autoencoders.

Result: Initial examples and a constructive definition of MAEs are provided, showcasing their potential in machine learning and biology.

Conclusion: MAEs offer a promising framework for capturing dynamic evolutionary properties across species, with broad applications in research.

Abstract: An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that, using self-supervised training,
learns a succinct parameterized representation, and a corresponding encoding
and decoding process, for all instances in a given class. Here, we introduce
the concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of
autoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the
values of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the
family is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated
encoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general
concept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the
defining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are
dynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim
report we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the
motivating research directions in machine learning and biology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in machine learning is critical, but existing fair CCA methods neglect downstream classification impacts, limiting their practicality.

Method: The proposed fair CCA method ensures projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, balancing fairness and accuracy.

Result: The method maintains high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks, as shown on synthetic and ADNI data.

Conclusion: This work advances fair machine learning in neuroimaging, ensuring unbiased analysis where fairness is essential.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations
between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations.
As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention.
However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream
classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA
method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are
independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without
compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating
its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving
fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in

TL;DR: The paper introduces Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks (NCGNs) to improve generative modeling of spatially structured graphs by dynamically adapting architecture to noise levels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based generative models for graphs use noise-independent architectures, limiting their expressiveness. The paper aims to address this by adapting the architecture to noise levels.

Method: The authors propose NCGNs, which modify architecture based on noise level, and introduce Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) to adapt message range and resolution.

Result: DMP outperforms noise-independent architectures in domains like 3D point clouds, transcriptomics, and images.

Conclusion: NCGNs, particularly DMP, enhance generative modeling of graphs by dynamically adjusting to noise, proving more effective than static architectures.

Abstract: Generative modeling of graphs with spatial structure is essential across many
applications from computer graphics to spatial genomics. Recent flow-based
generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then
learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph
neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting
their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce
\textit{Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks} (NCGNs), a class of graph neural
networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise
level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as
noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant
neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions.
Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific
instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message
passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise-independent
architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds,
spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multi-head latent attention (MLA) impacts transformer capacity during pretraining, revealing that decoupled rotary embeddings prevent spectral fragmentation and maintain capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of MLA on transformer capacity and how rotary embeddings influence spectral properties during pretraining.

Method: Analyzes the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix using Marchenko-Pastur diagnostics, comparing MHA, MLA-PreRoPE, and MLA-Decoupled variants.

Result: Finds that MHA and MLA-PreRoPE suffer from capacity bottlenecks and rank collapse, while MLA-Decoupled maintains broad spectral support and suppresses outliers.

Conclusion: Decoupling rotary embeddings across heads is crucial to prevent spectral fragmentation and preserve transformer capacity.

Abstract: In this work, we study how multi-head latent attention (MLA), a popular
strategy for compressing key/value memory, affects a transformer's internal
capacity during pretraining. Using a lightweight suite of Marchenko-Pastur (MP)
diagnostics, we analyze the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix
throughout training, comparing three variants: the standard multi-head
attention (MHA) baseline, MLA-PreRoPE with rotary applied before compression,
and MLA-Decoupled, which shares a single rotary sub-vector across all heads.
Our random matrix analysis reveals \textbf{three key findings:} \textbf{ i)}
capacity bottlenecks emerge locally: both MHA and MLA-PreRoPE exhibit sharp,
early spikes in specific layers that persist and propagate, disrupting the
balance between bulk and outlier directions; \textbf{ ii)} these spikes
coincide with rank collapse, concentrating the model's expressivity into narrow
subspaces; \textbf{ iii)} only the decoupled variant prevents this cascade,
maintaining broad spectral support and suppressing outlier formation across
layers. These results underscore that \emph{how} rotary embeddings are applied
is just as critical as \emph{where} compression occurs. Sharing rotary
components across heads mitigates spectral fragmentation and preserves
representational capacity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic method using scaling laws to determine optimal data mixtures for foundation models, validated across LLMs, NMMs, and LVMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trial-and-error methods for selecting data mixtures are impractical for large-scale pretraining.

Method: Uses scaling laws to predict model loss for any domain weight vector, validated in LLM, NMM, and LVM settings.

Result: Scaling laws accurately predict performance, extrapolate to new mixtures, and derive optimal domain weights.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, cost-effective alternative to trial-and-error for optimizing data mixtures.

Abstract: Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains,
with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical
role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture
relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale
pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data
mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately
predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific
domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by
demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale
settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large
vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can
extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be
accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to
estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The
scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain
under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to
costly trial-and-error methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial activation patching to detect and mitigate deceptive behaviors in LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness through simulations and proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs aligned for safety can still exhibit deceptive behaviors, posing risks. The study aims to address this by developing a framework to detect and mitigate such deception.

Method: Adversarial activation patching is used to simulate vulnerabilities in transformer-based models, with experiments conducted on toy neural networks.

Result: The method increased deceptive outputs to 23.9% from 0%, validating its effectiveness, with layer-specific variations supporting hypotheses.

Conclusion: The work advances AI safety by providing tools to study and mitigate deception in LLMs, with ethical considerations and future research directions outlined.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

### [336] [On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09428)
*Zakhar Shumaylov,Vasileios Tsiaras,Yannis Stylianou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper applies information geometry to model compression, emphasizing the importance of defining optimal low-compute submanifolds and projecting onto them. It highlights the role of information divergences for zero-shot accuracy and iterative methods for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective compression techniques for deep learning models due to increasing parameter counts, especially for resource-constrained devices.

Method: Uses information geometry to analyze model compression, focusing on operator factorization and iterative singular value thresholding for soft rank constraints.

Result: Demonstrates that information divergences are crucial for zero-shot accuracy, while iterative methods improve trainability for fine-tuning. Simple modifications to existing methods yield better performance under fixed compression rates.

Conclusion: Information geometry provides a valuable framework for understanding and improving model compression, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate
effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained
devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study
of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods
within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator
factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:
defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.
We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as
implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We
highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information
divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this
may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios,
trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for
achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation,
necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove
convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural
networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility
of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods
through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed
compression rates.

*Meriem Zerkouk,Miloud Mihoubi,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyCAST-Net is a novel architecture for causal discovery in multivariate time series, combining dilated convolutions and dynamic sparse attention for accuracy and interpretability, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial for decision-making in fields like finance and marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge traditional methods.

Method: DyCAST-Net integrates dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention with adaptive thresholding to capture multiscale dependencies and eliminate spurious connections. A statistical shuffle test validates robustness.

Result: DyCAST-Net outperforms models like TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer, providing precise causal delay estimation and reducing false discoveries. Attention heatmaps reveal hidden causal patterns.

Conclusion: DyCAST-Net is effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings, offering interpretable insights and scalability across domains, enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains

### [338] [Transformers Don't In-Context Learn Least Squares Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09440)
*Joshua Hill,Benjamin Eyre,Elliot Creager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained for in-context learning (ICL) fail to generalize under distribution shifts, suggesting they don't implement standard learning algorithms like OLS. Spectral analysis reveals unique signatures in representations for in-distribution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind ICL in transformers, particularly why they fail to generalize under distribution shifts.

Method: Study synthetic linear regression tasks, analyze out-of-distribution generalization, and perform spectral analysis of learned representations.

Result: Transformers don't implement OLS or similar algorithms; their performance is tied to in-distribution inputs with unique spectral signatures.

Conclusion: ICL behavior is shaped by pretraining data, and transformers rely on distribution-specific patterns rather than general learning algorithms.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example
input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success,
the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study
synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at
inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the
performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers
through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments
that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt
distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers
implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the
pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the
learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same
distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique
spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two
singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution
inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly
correlated with low loss.

*Luiz Aldeia Machado,Victor Coppo Leite,Elia Merzari,Arthur Motta,Roberto Ponciroli,Lander Ibarra,Lise Charlot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A CNN and thermomechanical model predict PWR fuel rod conditions using limited temperature data, aiding PdM in NPPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce NPP offline time by enabling real-time monitoring of fuel rod conditions for proactive maintenance.

Method: Combines CNN with thermomechanical modeling, trained on BISON and MOOSE-THM simulation data.

Result: Accurate temperature predictions, used to determine stress and strain distributions without overfitting.

Conclusion: The approach supports PdM tools for nuclear reactors by providing real-time condition monitoring.

Abstract: Proactive maintenance strategies, such as Predictive Maintenance (PdM), play
an important role in the operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), particularly
due to their capacity to reduce offline time by preventing unexpected shutdowns
caused by component failures.
  In this work, we explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture combined with a computational thermomechanical model to calculate
the temperature, stress, and strain of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel
rod during operation. This estimation relies on a limited number of temperature
measurements from the cladding's outer surface. This methodology can
potentially aid in developing PdM tools for nuclear reactors by enabling
real-time monitoring of such systems.
  The training, validation, and testing datasets were generated through coupled
simulations involving BISON, a finite element-based nuclear fuel performance
code, and the MOOSE Thermal-Hydraulics Module (MOOSE-THM). We conducted eleven
simulations, varying the peak linear heat generation rates. Of these, eight
were used for training, two for validation, and one for testing.
  The CNN was trained for over 1,000 epochs without signs of overfitting,
achieving highly accurate temperature distribution predictions. These were then
used in a thermomechanical model to determine the stress and strain
distribution within the fuel rod.

*Runze Yang,Longbing Cao,Xin You,Kun Fang,Jianxun Li,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method to improve time series forecasting by addressing inconsistencies in Fourier-based methods and integrating time-frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Fourier-based methods struggle with inconsistent starting cycles, series lengths, and overlook temporal information, limiting their effectiveness in time series forecasting.

Method: The FBM method integrates time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping, supporting plug-and-play integration with neural networks. Variants (FBM-L, FBM-NL, FBM-NP, FBM-S) enhance different models and decompose seasonal, trend, and interaction effects.

Result: FBM achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The FBM method effectively combines Fourier transform and deep learning, improving time series forecasting by addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

*Noah Marchal,William E. Janes,Mihail Popescu,Xing Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semi-supervised regression models using in-home sensor data improved ALS functional decline tracking, with transfer learning and self-attention interpolation showing superior accuracy for subscales, while linear interpolation was stable for composite scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical monitoring of ALS functional decline is intermittent, missing critical changes between visits. Continuous in-home sensor data could address this gap.

Method: Developed semi-supervised regression models (individual batch, cohort-level batch, incremental transfer learning) with linear, cubic, and self-attention interpolations to estimate ALSFRS-R trajectories.

Result: Transfer learning improved subscale predictions (28/32 contrasts), self-attention interpolation had lowest error for subscales, and linear interpolation was stable for composite scales. Functional domains showed distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles.

Conclusion: Matching learning methods to domain-specific profiles enhances ALS progression tracking accuracy, suggesting adaptive model integration for timely interventions and scalable deployment.

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic
assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address
this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of
decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with
continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model
paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental
fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and
ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort
homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with
transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32
contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting
the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention
interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models
(mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns,
outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though
linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models
(mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity
profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting
patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation,
while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories
suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and
pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific
homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS
progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor
monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment
in future multi-center studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: La-Proteina is a novel generative model for atomistic protein design, using a partially latent representation to jointly generate sequences and full-atom structures, achieving state-of-the-art performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models struggle with directly generating fully atomistic protein structures and sequences due to challenges like variable side-chain lengths.

Method: La-Proteina uses a partially latent representation (explicit backbone, latent sequence/atomistic details) and flow matching to model joint distributions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in co-designability, diversity, structural validity, and motif scaffolding, with scalability up to 800 residues.

Conclusion: La-Proteina advances atomistic protein design, addressing key challenges and outperforming baselines in critical tasks.

Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have
emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully
atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is
challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic
protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse
backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details
are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby
effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.
Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution
over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom
co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through
detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking
critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a
regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,
demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

*Guoyou Wang,Yihua Tan,Shiqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new discrete differential operator using Vandermonde matrices from truncated Taylor series to address dimensionality and error issues in Taylor's formula, achieving high accuracy and tighter error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Taylor's formula is crucial for function representation but suffers from dimensionality and error propagation in discrete cases.

Method: Proposes a discrete differential operator using Vandermonde matrices from truncated Taylor series, enabling simultaneous derivative computation and mitigating errors.

Result: Achieves high-order accuracy, tighter error bounds, and extends to 2D for multivariate derivatives, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The method is effective and superior, with broad applications in vision, fluid mechanics, and more.

Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation,
such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential
equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in
visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and
thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete
situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to
estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using
the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our
method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number
of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing
equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating
the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds
for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating
tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the
two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative
calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative
estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function
representation. Consequently, our technique offers broad applicability across
domains such as vision representation, feature extraction, fluid mechanics, and
cross-media imaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes TD learning methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions (QV-learning and AV-learning), comparing their convergence and efficiency. It finds AV-learning superior in control settings and introduces RDQ, a new AV-learning algorithm outperforming Dueling DQN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the advantages and theoretical soundness of learning two value functions (state and action values) in TD learning, compared to single-function methods like Q-learning.

Method: Analyzes QV-learning and AV-learning families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency, comparing them to Expected Sarsa and Q-learning. Introduces RDQ, a new AV-learning algorithm.

Result: AV-learning methods outperform Q-learning in control settings. RDQ significantly surpasses Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Conclusion: AV-learning, particularly RDQ, offers notable benefits over traditional single-function TD methods in control tasks, providing a more efficient and effective approach.

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping:
using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of
TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single
action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less
attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value
functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in
learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as
either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been
investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is
advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether
such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze
these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We
find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the
prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over
Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning
algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly
outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI models and legislative demands necessitate trustworthy XAI explanations, especially in high-risk scenarios with unbalanced datasets.

Method: Proposes an evaluation method for the minority class using on-manifold neighbor generation, explanation aggregation, and a consistency metric.

Result: Presents preliminary insights on explanation reliability in unbalanced datasets, demonstrated via a frost event dataset.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of robust explanations in XAI, particularly for minority classes in unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The usage of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods has become
essential in practical applications, given the increasing deployment of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and the legislative requirements put
forward in the latest years. A fundamental but often underestimated aspect of
the explanations is their robustness, a key property that should be satisfied
in order to trust the explanations. In this study, we provide some preliminary
insights on evaluating the reliability of explanations in the specific case of
unbalanced datasets, which are very frequent in high-risk use-cases, but at the
same time considerably challenging for both AI models and XAI methods. We
propose a simple evaluation focused on the minority class (i.e. the less
frequent one) that leverages on-manifold generation of neighbours, explanation
aggregation and a metric to test explanation consistency. We present a use-case
based on a tabular dataset with numerical features focusing on the occurrence
of frost events.

Motivation: To expose privacy risks in federated unlearning where gradient exchanges during unlearning can leak sensitive data.

Method: Introduces DRAGD and DRAGDP, attacks leveraging gradient differences and prior data to reconstruct forgotten data.

Result: DRAGD and DRAGDP outperform existing methods in reconstructing data, especially for complex datasets like facial images.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical privacy flaw in federated unlearning and advances security solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow
clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy
concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process
can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce
DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after
unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced
version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve
reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and
DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our
work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and
offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning
systems in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Two-stage optimization: intra-layer (identifies optimal compression solutions) and inter-layer (assigns bit-width and rank under memory constraints), with optional adaptive rounding.

Result: State-of-the-art results with up to 15% performance improvement on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

Conclusion: MLoRQ effectively integrates low-rank and quantization techniques, offering a practical solution for edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences by demonstrating the limitations of current methods, proposing negatively-correlated sampling, and introducing the Community Alignment dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLMs serve users with conflicting preferences across cultural, political, or other dimensions, the study highlights the gap between human preference diversity and LLM responses.

Method: The study involves a large-scale multilingual human survey (N=15,000) and evaluates 21 LLMs. It introduces negatively-correlated sampling and collects the Community Alignment dataset.

Result: Humans show more preference variation than LLMs. Existing methods fail to capture diversity, but negatively-correlated sampling improves alignment.

Conclusion: The Community Alignment dataset is a resource for better aligning LLMs with global user preferences.

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences
that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance
this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate,
through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from
five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in
preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show
that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for
learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient
dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity
of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for
negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that
simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the
performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,
based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source
Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and
multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons
from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment
dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for
a diverse global population.

Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP
methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain,
owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption.
We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal
predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on
deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful
structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random
guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover,
$e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3
loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of
5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive
sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore
critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our
work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure,
privacy-aware learning systems.

### [351] [Networked Information Aggregation via Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09683)
*Michael Kearns,Aaron Roth,Emily Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies distributed learning in a DAG where agents observe partial features and parent predictions, aiming for information aggregation. Depth of the DAG is key for achieving competitive error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when distributed learning in a DAG can aggregate information effectively despite partial feature access.

Method: Agents learn sequentially in a DAG, using observed features and parent predictions. Theoretical bounds are derived for linear and general hypothesis classes.

Result: Depth of the DAG is critical for information aggregation; sufficient depth allows competitive error bounds, while insufficient depth (e.g., hub-and-spokes) prevents it.

Conclusion: DAG depth determines information aggregation success, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded
in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution
over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to
directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different
subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent
with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations
to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of
their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the
instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as
additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve
\emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able
to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have
been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all}
features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access.
We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general
hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key
parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in
the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along
the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot
occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not
have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke
vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical
results with a comprehensive set of experiments.

### [352] [Post-Training Quantization of Generative and Discriminative LSTM Text Classifiers: A Study of Calibration, Class Balance, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09687)
*Md Mushfiqur Rahaman,Elliot Chang,Tasmiah Haque,Srinjoy Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study compares generative and discriminative LSTM-based text classifiers with PTQ, revealing generative models' sensitivity to bitwidth, calibration data, and noise, while discriminative models remain robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text classification in edge computing requires low latency and high accuracy, with generative models being robust to noise but facing deployment challenges due to computational constraints.

Method: Comparative study of generative and discriminative LSTM models using PTQ with Brevitas, evaluating robustness across bitwidths and noisy inputs, and analyzing class imbalance in calibration data.

Result: Generative classifiers are more sensitive to bitwidth and calibration data, with class imbalance degrading performance at lower bitwidths, while discriminative models stay robust.

Conclusion: Calibration data quality is crucial for PTQ success, especially for generative classifiers, impacting their deployment in noisy edge environments.

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like
industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low
latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in
particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and
noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such
real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices
faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)
reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for
edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of
generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text
classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We
evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess
their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while
discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to
bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized
inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for
both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly
distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and
activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from
nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data
during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths
for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This
study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative
classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge
environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents an open-source framework for developing correlation kernels, enhancing surrogate modeling with frequency-aware elements and diverse kernel types, validated on test cases and integrated into SMT 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional kernel functions in capturing complex mechanical behaviors and time-frequency dynamics, particularly in aircraft systems.

Method: Extends kernel functions beyond exponential-based methods to include variants like exponential squared sine and rational quadratic kernels, with derivatives. Validated on test cases and applied to real-world problems.

Result: Successful integration into SMT 2.0, enabling flexible and customizable kernel configurations for surrogate modeling.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile toolset for engineers and researchers, opening avenues for metamodeling in frequency-sensitive domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing
correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of
kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques,
we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex
mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems.
Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are
extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine
and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand
second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a
sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon
Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these
advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox
(SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable
kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of
various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models
tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible
toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future
applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

TL;DR: EPT-2, an advanced AI model for Earth system forecasting, outperforms its predecessor and leading competitors like Microsoft Aurora and ECMWF IFS HRES. It introduces EPT-2e for probabilistic forecasting, surpassing ECMWF ENS at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Earth system forecasting by improving accuracy and computational efficiency over existing models.

Method: Developed EPT-2, an AI foundation model, and its ensemble variant EPT-2e for probabilistic forecasting.

Result: EPT-2 outperforms EPT-1.5, Microsoft Aurora, and ECMWF IFS HRES. EPT-2e surpasses ECMWF ENS with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: EPT-2 and EPT-2e set new benchmarks in Earth system forecasting, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We present EPT-2, the latest iteration in our Earth Physics Transformer (EPT)
family of foundation AI models for Earth system forecasting. EPT-2 delivers
substantial improvements over its predecessor, EPT-1.5, and sets a new state of
the art in predicting energy-relevant variables-including 10m and 100m wind
speed, 2m temperature, and surface solar radiation-across the full 0-240h
forecast horizon. It consistently outperforms leading AI weather models such as
Microsoft Aurora, as well as the operational numerical forecast system IFS HRES
from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In
parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for
probabilistic forecasting, called EPT-2e. Remarkably, EPT-2e significantly
surpasses the ECMWF ENS mean-long considered the gold standard for medium- to
longrange forecasting-while operating at a fraction of the computational cost.
EPT models, as well as third-party forecasts, are accessible via the app.jua.ai

*Sara Si-Moussi,Stephan Hennekens,Sander Mucher,Stan Los,Wilfried Thuiller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using high-resolution remote sensing and AI to improve habitat classification, addressing challenges like co-occurring habitats and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, high-resolution habitat maps are crucial for conservation but current methods struggle with thematic/spatial resolution and class imbalance.

Method: Used vegetation plots and AI tools, integrating multi-spectral and radar imagery, and ensemble machine learning to model habitats across Europe.

Result: Hierarchical strategies and Earth Observation models improved classification, especially in fragmented landscapes, with ensemble learning boosting accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable globally; future work should focus on dynamic habitats, segmentation, and next-gen data.

Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that
support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these
ecosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,
high-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and
restoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial
resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types
that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that
complicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote
sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat
classification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using
vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3
EUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against
independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical
nature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially
in fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation
models, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.
Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted
accuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe
and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance
temporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and
quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with
higher-quality in-situ observations.

TL;DR: A foundational AI model for universal physics simulation learns physical laws from boundary-condition data without predefined equations, outperforming traditional methods like PINNs and finite-difference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional physics simulation methods that require explicit mathematical formulations, which restrict generalizability and discovery potential.

Method: Uses a sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach, treating simulation as conditional generation where boundary conditions guide steady-state solutions. Enhanced diffusion transformers with spatial relationship encoding enable direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping.

Result: Achieves SSIM > 0.8 with sub-pixel boundary accuracy, bypassing temporal integration errors. Enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via LRP.

Conclusion: Represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first universal physics simulation framework.

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-equivariant CNNs with rotation augmentations can match equivariant GNNs in molecular tasks, simplifying model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for high-quality 3D molecular generation, given the complexity and scalability issues of equivariant GNNs.

Method: Use non-equivariant CNNs trained with rotation augmentations, analyze equivariance learning via a derived loss decomposition, and evaluate performance on denoising, generation, and property prediction tasks.

Result: Demonstrates that non-equivariant CNNs can achieve comparable performance to equivariant models, with insights into how model size, dataset size, and training duration impact results.

Conclusion: Learned equivariance in non-equivariant CNNs is viable for generative tasks, offering a simpler alternative to equivariant GNNs.

Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with
most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs)
under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating
high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to
train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the
performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that
separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model
size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising,
molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.

Motivation: Understanding gene regulation and biological processes requires accurate TFBS prediction, necessitating robust and interpretable models.

Result: The MoE model excels in diverse TF binding sites, particularly OOD, with ANOVA-confirmed significance. ShiftSmooth enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: The work offers an efficient, generalizable, and interpretable TFBS prediction solution, advancing genome biology and transcriptional regulation understanding.

Abstract: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for
understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study
introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction,
integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models,
each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of
our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription
factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model
achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites,
particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences.
Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique
that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in
input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that
ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization
compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an
efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction,
potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our
understanding of transcriptional regulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGPD, a novel framework combining physics-based supervision with spatio-temporal learning for accurate RUL and SOH estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate RUL and SOH estimation is critical for PHM in industrial applications, requiring robust and adaptive methods.

Method: RGPD integrates GCRNs, GATConv, SAC, and Q-learning to dynamically weight physics-informed loss terms and enhance spatio-temporal learning.

Result: RGPD consistently outperforms existing models in RUL and SOH tasks, showing robustness across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed RGPD framework effectively combines physics and learning for superior PHM performance, reducing manual tuning needs.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH)
is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of
industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that
combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning.
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional
filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over
time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention
mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically
weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit
(TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module
improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden
representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To
identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents
dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving
generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for
manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong
robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across
three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: A neural network architecture for speech separation with early-exit capability and an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework is proposed, enabling dynamic compute-scaling while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of fixed compute and parameter budgets in existing speech separation architectures, which restricts their use in embedded and heterogeneous devices like mobile phones and hearables.

Method: Designs an early-exit neural network architecture and introduces an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework to model clean speech and error variance, deriving probabilistic early-exit conditions based on desired signal-to-noise ratios.

Result: The single early-exit model competes with state-of-the-art models across varying compute and parameter budgets, achieving fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable and interpretable speech separation with state-of-the-art performance, suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has
improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and
parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are,
however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently
cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in
embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To
enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech
separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware
probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error
variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of
desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech
separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model
can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and
parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling
of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and
interpretable exit conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and accurate molecular conformer generation is crucial for computational chemistry and drug discovery, but current methods require significant computational resources.

Method: Proposes SO(3)-Averaged Flow for faster training and reflow/distillation for fast inference in flow-based models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art conformer generation quality with faster convergence and enables few-step or one-step high-quality generation.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques pave the way for efficient molecular conformer generation using flow-based models.

Abstract: Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for
downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently,
training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for
conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work,
we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating
training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer
generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training
objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality
compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We
demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach
state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that
the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or
even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training
techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular
conformer generation with flow-based models.

*Junaid Iqbal Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods, Blend and A-AMU, to accelerate approximate machine unlearning (AMU) by reducing retained dataset size and optimizing the unlearning objective for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AMU methods are computationally expensive due to retained dataset processing and slow convergence. The paper aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: 1. Blend: A distribution-matching dataset condensation method merging visually similar images. 2. A-AMU: A loss-centric method combining steepened primary loss and a novel regularizer for faster convergence.

Result: The dual approach significantly reduces unlearning latency while maintaining model utility and privacy.

Conclusion: The paper presents an efficient solution for AMU by integrating dataset condensation and loss optimization, achieving faster unlearning without compromising performance.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific
training data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained dataset subset.
However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime,
while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two
complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First,
\textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges
visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the
retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our
loss-centric method, \textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning
objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened
primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer
that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen
data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and
loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency
across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model
utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset
condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional language modeling struggles with ambiguity, as multiple futures can be equally plausible for a given context.

Method: Combines Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to handle ambiguity. Theoretical interpretation assumes data from a mixture of distributions.

Result: Achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs, demonstrated on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL effectively addresses ambiguity in language modeling, producing diverse and plausible continuations.

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

*Audri Banik,Glaucio Haroldo Silva de Carvalho,Renata Dividino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight graph-aware Federated Learning (FL) method is proposed for traffic prediction, combining FedAvg simplicity with graph learning to capture spatial relationships efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic prediction requires capturing spatial dependencies between regions, which standard FL methods like FedAvg ignore, while graph-based FL methods are computationally heavy.

Method: The approach blends FedAvg with neighborhood aggregation, weighting client models based on graph connectivity to capture spatial relationships without full model training.

Result: Evaluated on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets, the method achieves competitive performance against baselines and graph-based FL techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight graph-aware FL method effectively balances performance and computational efficiency for traffic prediction.

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in
specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices
deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an
individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning
(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing
raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model
updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each
client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in
traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are
important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies
during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant
computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL
approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph
learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic
neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting
client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial
relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,
and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard
baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

### [366] [Reasoning or Memorization? Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10532)
*Mingqi Wu,Zhihao Zhang,Qiaole Dong,Zhiheng Xi,Jun Zhao,Senjie Jin,Xiaoran Fan,Yuhao Zhou,Yanwei Fu,Qin Liu,Songyang Zhang,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reliability of reasoning improvements in LLMs using RL, revealing data contamination issues in benchmarks and advocating for uncontaminated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the reliability of reported reasoning improvements in LLMs, particularly due to data contamination in popular benchmarks.

Method: Introduces a synthetic dataset generator (RandomCalculation) to create leakage-free arithmetic problems and evaluates RL methods on it.

Result: Accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not, highlighting benchmark contamination issues.

Conclusion: Advocates for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and diverse models to ensure trustworthy conclusions.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

### [367] [Compressed Computation: Dense Circuits in a Toy Model of the Universal-AND Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09816)
*Adam Newgas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether neural networks can learn compressed computation for the Universal-AND problem, finding a practical, dense solution that outperforms theoretical constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if neural networks can learn efficient computational circuits (compressed computation) in practice, using the Universal-AND problem as a toy model.

Method: A toy model for the Universal-AND problem is trained under restricted hidden dimensions to encourage compute-efficient circuits. The solution is analyzed for scalability, robustness, and efficiency.

Result: The model discovers a dense, scalable solution that is robust to parameter changes and outperforms theoretical constructions at low sparsity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the flexibility of superposition in neural networks and provide insights into practical circuit formation, aiding network interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features
than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for
computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there
has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in
practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND
problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.
The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is
restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called
compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple
solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully
dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit
naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.
It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and
extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain
the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the
theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types
of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition
representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network
circuitry and interpretability.

*Jintao Qu,Zichong Wang,Chenhao Wu,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A trainable model combining DTW's interpretability with neural networks' adaptability is proposed, excelling in both low- and rich-resource time series classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of neural networks (need for large labeled data, lack of interpretability) and DTW (non-trainable, ineffective with large data) by creating a versatile, interpretable, and trainable model.

Method: Develop a dynamic length-shortening algorithm to transform time series into prototypes, reformulate DTW into a recurrent neural network, and construct a trainable model mimicking DTW's behavior.

Result: The model outperforms previous methods in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully bridges the gap between interpretability and trainability, offering a versatile solution for time series classification.

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series
classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

*Jiatong Li,Qi Liu,Mengxiao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel generative paradigm for cognitive diagnosis (CD) is introduced, shifting from predictive to generative modeling, enabling faster and more reliable diagnosis for new learners without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CD models are limited by expensive retraining for new learners and unreliable outputs. This study aims to overcome these challenges with a generative approach.

Method: Proposes Generative Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model (G-NCDM), incorporating identifiability and monotonicity conditions.

Result: Achieves ×100 speedup for diagnosing new learners and outperforms traditional methods in scalability and reliability.

Conclusion: The generative framework enhances CD applications in AI, particularly for intelligent education systems, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

*Quang Truong,Zhikai Chen,Mingxuan Ju,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TVE is a pre-training framework for relational databases that models task heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizable pre-training for relational databases due to task heterogeneity and diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Introduces Task Vector Estimation (TVE), which uses set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs and models relational dynamics.

Result: TVE outperforms traditional pre-training baselines on the RelBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Pre-training objectives should encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure for effective predictive modeling on relational databases.

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of
domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning
from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.
Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks
are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and
SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to
take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.
By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label
generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel
information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a
novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via
set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling
next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an
information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations
retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive
experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms
traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training
objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design
principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

*MohammadReza Davari,Utkarsh Garg,Weixin Cai,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) framework for black-box LLM APIs, combining negative and positive reinforcement for better feedback, feedback diversification to reduce noise, and Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO) for efficient prompt migration across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APO methods focus on error correction and ignore insights from correct predictions, limiting effectiveness. The paper aims to enhance feedback mechanisms and address prompt migration challenges in evolving LLM ecosystems.

Method: Proposes a novel APO framework with positive reinforcement for preserving beneficial prompt components, feedback diversification to aggregate reliable feedback, and CPO for efficient prompt migration between models.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines, achieving higher accuracy, faster convergence, and lower computational costs in standard and migration scenarios.

Conclusion: The enhanced APO framework with diversified feedback and CPO significantly improves prompt optimization and migration, making it more effective and efficient for real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: An increasing number of NLP applications interact with large language models
(LLMs) through black-box APIs, making prompt engineering critical for
controlling model outputs. While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO)
methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual
gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable
insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on
enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form
of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive
reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified
through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated
feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which
aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice
while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of
available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO),
addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts
between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that
naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical
instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and
lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the Schedule-Free (SF) method for large-scale training, showing its effectiveness without decay phases or memory overhead, and proposes a refined variant for better robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pretraining strategies are inadequate for large-scale training, and existing alternatives like WSD and weight averaging have limitations.

Method: The study analyzes the SF method theoretically and empirically, revealing its implicit weight averaging, and proposes a refined variant.

Result: SF-AdamW effectively navigates the loss landscape without decay phases or memory overhead, and the refined variant improves robustness and performance.

Conclusion: SF is established as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

### [373] [Task Priors: Enhancing Model Evaluation by Considering the Entire Space of Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09871)
*Niket Patel,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for evaluating AI models by defining a distribution of tasks (Task Priors), addressing the limitations of fixed benchmark evaluations in self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation relies on rigid, hand-picked benchmarks, creating a bottleneck. The authors aim to provide a more flexible and comprehensive evaluation method.

Method: Introduces Task Priors, a probabilistic space of downstream tasks, allowing evaluation over all possible tasks weighted by their likelihood.

Result: The framework enables answering key questions about model performance, such as average performance and variance across tasks.

Conclusion: Task Priors offer a new evaluation standard, potentially accelerating research in self-supervised learning by providing a more dynamic and representative assessment.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning
(SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In
contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely
on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large
amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of
evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that
such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To
remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by
adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,
one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream
tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as
(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream
tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the
variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the
defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we
believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where
downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have
access to.

TL;DR: AdaBrain-Bench is introduced as a standardized benchmark to evaluate brain foundation models in non-invasive BCI tasks, addressing the lack of practical benchmarks in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high noise and limited task-specific data in non-invasive BCI signals hinder decoding capabilities, and current foundation models lack comprehensive benchmarks for widespread adoption.

Method: AdaBrain-Bench includes diverse BCI datasets, a task adaptation pipeline, multi-dimensional metrics, and adaptation tools to assess model generalizability.

Result: The benchmark evaluates public brain foundation models, providing insights for model selection in various transfer settings (cross-subject, multi-subject, few-shot).

Conclusion: AdaBrain-Bench offers a reproducible, evolving platform to advance robust and generalized neural decoding solutions in non-invasive BCI research.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible
means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad
applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities.
However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive
signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of
self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI
research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture
generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled
electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite
these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and
extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models
across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this
challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to
systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI
tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI
decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task
adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a
set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for
assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer
settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We
leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain
foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate
models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable
reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving
platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding
solutions.

TL;DR: TolerantECG is a robust foundation model for ECG signals, handling noise and incomplete lead data, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG effectiveness is hindered by noise or missing leads, leading to diagnostic errors.

Method: Combines contrastive and self-supervised learning to train on noisy, incomplete signals and text reports.

Result: Top or second-best performance on PTB-XL and highest on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Conclusion: TolerantECG effectively addresses ECG signal challenges, improving diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing
heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or
unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings,
resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise
and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG.
TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning
frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their
corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted
or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that
TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across
various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and
achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

TL;DR: NeuTSFlow reframes time series forecasting as learning transitions between continuous function families, using Neural Operators for flow matching in function spaces, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods treat time series as discrete sequences, ignoring their continuous nature and the ambiguity in determining underlying functions from noisy samples.

Method: Proposes NeuTSFlow, leveraging Neural Operators to model transitions between historical and future function families via flow matching in infinite-dimensional spaces.

Result: NeuTSFlow shows superior accuracy and robustness in diverse forecasting tasks, validating the function-family perspective.

Conclusion: The function-family approach and NeuTSFlow framework effectively address the challenges of continuous time series forecasting, offering improved performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet
conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their
origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy
observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they
correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can
be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a
shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as
learning the transition from the historical function family to the future
function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we
leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships
between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the
transition path in function space from the historical function family to the
future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a
novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for
learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By
parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function
spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies
at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.
Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior
accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family
perspective.

TL;DR: scSGC introduces a soft graph clustering method for scRNA-seq data, addressing limitations of hard graph constructions by using non-binary edge weights, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard graph constructions in GNN-based scRNA-seq clustering lose continuous similarity features and confuse inter-cluster connections, leading to biased results.

Method: scSGC combines a ZINB-based autoencoder, dual-channel soft graph embedding, and optimal transport-based clustering optimization.

Result: Outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, annotation, and efficiency across ten datasets.

Conclusion: scSGC advances scRNA-seq analysis by better capturing cellular heterogeneity and improving clustering outcomes.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

TL;DR: RNNs trained on the streaming parity task show a phase transition to perfect infinite generalization, revealing a mechanism for learning algorithms from finite data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks, particularly RNNs, can generalize infinitely beyond training data by learning algorithms.

Method: Case study of RNNs on the streaming parity task, analyzing learning dynamics and representational merger.

Result: RNNs exhibit a phase transition to perfect infinite generalization, constructing a finite automaton for the task.

Conclusion: The study reveals a mechanism for infinite generalization in neural networks through implicit algorithm learning.

Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable
ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on
generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some
settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the
bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite
generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been
learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop
an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a
simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show
that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase
transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for
the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger
effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that
reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which
neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.

TL;DR: DepBERT integrates dependency trees into a transformer model for better cause-effect phrase extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised methods lack integration of linguistic tools like dependency trees, which are effective for semantic extraction.

Method: DepBERT extends a transformer model by incorporating dependency trees into its framework.

Result: DepBERT outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods on three datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating dependency trees into transformer models enhances cause-effect extraction performance.

Abstract: Extracting cause and effect phrases from a sentence is an important NLP task,
with numerous applications in various domains, including legal, medical,
education, and scientific research. There are many unsupervised and supervised
methods proposed for solving this task. Among these, unsupervised methods
utilize various linguistic tools, including syntactic patterns, dependency
tree, dependency relations, etc. among different sentential units for
extracting the cause and effect phrases. On the other hand, the contemporary
supervised methods use various deep learning based mask language models
equipped with a token classification layer for extracting cause and effect
phrases. Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a
sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for
extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do
not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework.
In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by
incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework.
Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than
various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to interpret LLMs' reasoning in safety-critical domains like nuclear engineering, using fine-tuning and neuron analysis to enhance transparency and assure AI reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' internal reasoning is crucial for their safe integration into nuclear engineering, addressing regulatory challenges and ensuring AI reliability.

Method: The study fine-tuned a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) for nuclear tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation, analyzed neuron activation changes, and employed neuron silencing to probe causality.

Result: Silencing specialized neurons collectively degraded task performance, while qualitative analysis showed impaired technical accuracy, highlighting their role in domain-specific reasoning.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances LLM transparency, linking domain expertise to neural circuits, and advances nuclear-grade AI assurance for regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains,
such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their
internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for
interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a
Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM
(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation
patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a
sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the
adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we
employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while
silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a
statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively
led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative
analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's
ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This
paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an
opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable

*Gaurav R. Ghosal,Pratyush Maini,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemSinks isolates memorized content in large language models by design, making it easier to remove without affecting general language abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and copyright concerns by mitigating memorization of repeated sequences in language models.

Method: Introduces MemSinks, a paradigm using sequence identifiers to activate unique memorization neurons for each sequence.

Result: Effective isolation of memorized content and strong generalization demonstrated at billion-parameter scale.

Conclusion: MemSinks offers a practical solution for balancing memorization removal and language model performance.

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is
achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

*Taigo Sakai,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic neuron adjustment method inspired by biological learning processes improves performance on class-imbalanced datasets by periodically adding and pruning neurons during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed neuron counts in deep learning may hinder performance on imbalanced datasets, unlike the human hippocampus which dynamically adjusts neurons.

Method: Proposes periodic neuron addition and removal during training to enhance representation for minority classes while maintaining final network size.

Result: Outperforms fixed-size networks and works well with other imbalance-handling techniques, as shown on three datasets and five models.

Conclusion: Dynamic neuron adjustment, inspired by biology, effectively improves accuracy on class-imbalanced data.

Abstract: In conventional deep learning, the number of neurons typically remains fixed
during training. However, insights from biology suggest that the human
hippocampus undergoes continuous neuron generation and pruning of neurons over
the course of learning, implying that a flexible allocation of capacity can
contribute to enhance performance. Real-world datasets often exhibit class
imbalance situations where certain classes have far fewer samples than others,
leading to significantly reduce recognition accuracy for minority classes when
relying on fixed size networks.To address the challenge, we propose a method
that periodically adds and removes neurons during training, thereby boosting
representational power for minority classes. By retaining critical features
learned from majority classes while selectively increasing neurons for
underrepresented classes, our approach dynamically adjusts capacity during
training. Importantly, while the number of neurons changes throughout training,
the final network size and structure remain unchanged, ensuring efficiency and
compatibility with deployment.Furthermore, by experiments on three different
datasets and five representative models, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms fixed size networks and shows even greater accuracy when
combined with other imbalance-handling techniques. Our results underscore the
effectiveness of dynamic, biologically inspired network designs in improving
performance on class-imbalanced data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the generalizability gap in deep learning-based HLS prediction models.

Method: Uses synthetic data augmentation (Iceberg) with LLM-generated programs and weak labels, integrated with in-context model architecture for meta-learning.

Result: 86.4% improvement in geometric mean accuracy, 2.47× and 1.12× better offline DSE performance on test datasets.

Conclusion: Iceberg effectively enhances model generalizability and performance in real-world HLS applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based prediction models for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of
hardware designs often struggle to generalize. In this paper, we study how to
close the generalizability gap of these models through pretraining on synthetic
data and introduce Iceberg, a synthetic data augmentation approach that expands
both large language model (LLM)-generated programs and weak labels of unseen
design configurations. Our weak label generation method is integrated with an
in-context model architecture, enabling meta-learning from actual and proximate
labels. Iceberg improves the geometric mean modeling accuracy by $86.4\%$ when
adapt to six real-world applications with few-shot examples and achieves a
$2.47\times$ and a $1.12\times$ better offline DSE performance when adapting to
two different test datasets. Our open-sourced code is here:

### [384] [Hierarchical Job Classification with Similarity Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09949)
*Md Ahsanul Kabir,Kareem Abdelfatah,Mohammed Korayem,Mohammad Al Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel model for job classification leverages hierarchical industry categories and representation learning to improve accuracy in online recruitment systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of job titles and descriptions in evolving job markets requires advanced models to enhance job recommendation and labor market analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional text classification.

Method: Proposes a representation learning and classification model embedding jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent space, integrating SOC and Carotene taxonomies to capture graph and hierarchical relationships.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing hierarchical structures and semantic features, demonstrated on a large-scale job postings dataset.

Conclusion: The research offers a robust framework for accurate job classification, aiding better recruitment decision-making.

Abstract: In the dynamic realm of online recruitment, accurate job classification is
paramount for optimizing job recommendation systems, search rankings, and labor
market analyses. As job markets evolve, the increasing complexity of job titles
and descriptions necessitates sophisticated models that can effectively
leverage intricate relationships within job data. Traditional text
classification methods often fall short, particularly due to their inability to
fully utilize the hierarchical nature of industry categories. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation learning and classification
model that embeds jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent
embedding space. Our model integrates the Standard Occupational Classification
(SOC) system and an in-house hierarchical taxonomy, Carotene, to capture both
graph and hierarchical relationships, thereby improving classification
accuracy. By embedding hierarchical industry categories into a shared latent
space, we tackle cold start issues and enhance the dynamic matching of
candidates to job opportunities. Extensive experimentation on a large-scale
dataset of job postings demonstrates the model's superior ability to leverage
hierarchical structures and rich semantic features, significantly outperforming
existing methods. This research provides a robust framework for improving job
classification accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in the
recruitment industry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel distance estimation method in latent space for recommender systems, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which improves accuracy and addresses the cold-start problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define meaningful and measurable distances in latent space for capturing user-item relationships effectively, addressing noise and improving neighborhood construction.

Method: Proposes a systematic approximation of latent space distances using row-wise and column-wise distances in the observed matrix, refining with empirical variance correction. Introduces RNE for neighborhood construction and smoothing via localized kernel regression.

Result: RNE outperforms existing collaborative filtering and matrix factorization methods in evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The novel distance estimation and RNE provide a structured approach to recommender systems, improving accuracy and mitigating the cold-start problem.

Abstract: Recommender systems inherently exhibit a low-rank structure in latent space.
A key challenge is to define meaningful and measurable distances in the latent
space to capture user-user, item-item, user-item relationships effectively. In
this work, we establish that distances in the latent space can be
systematically approximated using row-wise and column-wise distances in the
observed matrix, providing a novel perspective on distance estimation. To
refine the distance estimation, we introduce the correction based on empirical
variance estimator to account for noise-induced non-centrality. The novel
distance estimation enables a more structured approach to constructing
neighborhoods, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which
constructs neighborhoods by including both overlapped and partially overlapped
user-item pairs and employs neighborhood smoothing via localized kernel
regression to improve imputation accuracy. We provide the theoretical
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator. We perform evaluations on both
simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RNE achieves superior
performance compared to existing collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization methods. While our primary focus is on distance estimation in
latent space, we find that RNE also mitigates the ``cold-start'' problem.

TL;DR: The paper revisits inductive biases in GNNWR, proposing enhancements using neural network concepts to improve spatial regression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current GNNWR approaches for modeling spatial non-stationarity by incorporating advanced neural network techniques.

Method: Generalize GNNWR using CNN, RNN, and transformer concepts, introducing local receptive fields, sequential context, and self-attention.

Result: GNNWR outperforms classic methods in capturing complex spatial relationships, with performance varying by data characteristics.

Conclusion: Inductive bias is crucial in spatial modeling; future work includes learnable weighting functions and hybrid architectures for better interpretability.

Abstract: Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how
well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This
work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted
Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for
modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional
Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial
weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed
distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize
GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,
sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through
extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying
heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic
methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results
also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,
with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,
and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These
findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and
suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,
hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling
non-stationary spatial data.

### [387] [Text-Driven Causal Representation Learning for Source-Free Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09961)
*Lihua Zhou,Mao Ye,Nianxin Li,Shuaifeng Li,Jinlin Wu,Xiatian Zhu,Lei Deng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TDCRL integrates causal inference into source-free domain generalization (SFDG) to address domain-specific confounders, achieving robust, domain-invariant features without needing multiple source domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with distribution shifts between training and test data. Traditional DG requires costly multi-domain data, while existing SFDG methods fail to handle domain-specific confounders effectively.

Method: TDCRL uses text prompts for data augmentation and trains a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract domain-invariant features.

Result: TDCRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet.

Conclusion: TDCRL effectively addresses SFDG challenges by combining causal learning with text-driven representation learning, ensuring robust generalization.

Abstract: Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions
differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data
from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data
collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable
source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate
visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods
struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the
SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation
to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a
clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,
ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL
effectiveness in SFDG.

*Xiangyu Sun,Amin Yousefpour,Shirin Hosseinmardi,Ramin Bostanabad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mesh-free framework using physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs) with shared neural network mean functions addresses limitations in ML-based compliance minimization, offering better control, efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML methods for compliance minimization suffer from poor feature boundaries, high costs, and lack of design complexity control.

Method: Proposes a GP-based framework with shared multi-output NN mean functions and PGCAN architecture, minimizing compliance, energy, and constraints without data-based residuals.

Result: Achieves super-resolution topologies, faster convergence, smaller compliance, less gray area, fine-scale feature control, and outperforms traditional and ML methods.

Conclusion: The GP-based framework effectively addresses ML limitations in compliance minimization, offering superior performance and control.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention
for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods
typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a
systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these
limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on
physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the
design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but
share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The
architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention
Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also
provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate
all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing
the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction
constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as
GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on
curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and
robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution
topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray
area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control
over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

*Yash Arya,Sang Hoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how graph structure, including community features, affects neural network performance in image classification, finding that densely interconnected communities enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of realistic network structures (e.g., communities, heterogeneous degrees) on neural network performance, addressing gaps in prior narrow-focused studies.

Method: Uses model networks (random, scale-free) and compares them with a biological neural network, analyzing structural impacts on image classification tasks.

Result: Networks with coherent, densely interconnected communities show better learning performance, with findings validated against biological networks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of network structure in performance, offering insights for designing biologically inspired neural networks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as
reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant
attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship
between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive
performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks,
particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work
advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation,
incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous
degree distributions and community structures, which are typical
characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a
nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model
networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a
biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We
examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image
classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect
performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely
interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The
comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our
findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth
further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and
machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more
biologically informed neural networks.

Motivation: Valley Fever is a significant public health issue in endemic regions, requiring advanced forecasting tools to inform prevention efforts.

Method: The study uses a graph neural network (GNN) to integrate case data with environmental predictors (soil, atmospheric, agricultural, air quality) and explores correlation-based relationships with lagged effects.

Result: The GNN effectively models Valley Fever trends and identifies key environmental drivers of incidence.

Conclusion: The model can support early warning systems and resource allocation for disease prevention in high-risk areas.

Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, remains a significant
public health concern in endemic regions of the southwestern United States.
This study develops the first graph neural network (GNN) model for forecasting
Valley Fever incidence in Arizona. The model integrates surveillance case data
with environmental predictors using graph structures, including soil
conditions, atmospheric variables, agricultural indicators, and air quality
metrics. Our approach explores correlation-based relationships among variables
influencing disease transmission. The model captures critical delays in disease
progression through lagged effects, enhancing its capacity to reflect complex
temporal dependencies in disease ecology. Results demonstrate that the GNN
architecture effectively models Valley Fever trends and provides insights into
key environmental drivers of disease incidence. These findings can inform early
warning systems and guide resource allocation for disease prevention efforts in

TL;DR: The paper introduces scMPT, a model combining scGPT and LLMs to improve single-cell analysis by leveraging biological insights from text, outperforming individual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell foundation models like scGPT lack the ability to utilize textual biological information, while LLMs, though competitive, are not well-understood in their application to single-cell data.

Method: The study investigates biological insights driving LLM performance on single-cell data and introduces scMPT, a fusion model combining scGPT and LLM representations.

Result: scMPT outperforms its component models (scGPT and LLMs) with more consistent performance across datasets. Alternate fusion methods also show promise.

Conclusion: LLMs can complement single-cell foundation models like scGPT, enhancing single-cell analysis through synergistic integration.

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant
advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are
inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as
text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several
recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell
foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little
understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus
on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to
single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what
biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to
single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies
between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these
insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either
of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between
each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods,
demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with
scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for
LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in
single-cell analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of established efficiency and sustainability in robust training pipelines for machine learning, particularly for decision trees.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) automated perturbation size selection, (2) training state-of-the-art adversarial methods, and (3) robustness certification.

Result: Perturbation size can be estimated from smaller models for efficiency. Verification time is not correlated with training time.

Conclusion: The pipeline improves efficiency in robust training, with insights into perturbation size selection and verification time.

Abstract: As machine learning gets adopted into the industry quickly, trustworthiness
is increasingly in focus. Yet, efficiency and sustainability of robust training
pipelines still have to be established. In this work, we consider a simple
pipeline for training adversarially robust decision trees and investigate the
efficiency of each step. Our pipeline consists of three stages. Firstly, we
choose the perturbation size automatically for each dataset. For that, we
introduce a simple algorithm, instead of relying on intuition or prior work.
Moreover, we show that the perturbation size can be estimated from smaller
models than the one intended for full training, and thus significant gains in
efficiency can be achieved. Secondly, we train state-of-the-art adversarial
training methods and evaluate them regarding both their training time and
adversarial accuracy. Thirdly, we certify the robustness of each of the models
thus obtained and investigate the time required for this. We find that
verification time, which is critical to the efficiency of the full pipeline, is
not correlated with training time.

Conclusion: The method effectively compresses linear SSMs while maintaining performance, aiding deployment on constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for

to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show

TL;DR: PRRO pipeline improves synthetic tabular data quality for supervised learning by addressing class imbalance and data relationship issues, enhancing predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data often underperforms in supervised learning due to class imbalance and overlooked data relationships. PRRO aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PRRO integrates data pruning and column reordering to align synthetic data with original data's class distribution and SL model structure.

Result: PRRO improves predictive performance by up to 871.46% and enhances class distribution similarity by 43% on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: PRRO fosters better integration of synthetic data into supervised learning, improving data analysis quality and accessibility.

Abstract: Tabular data synthesis for supervised learning ('SL') model training is
gaining popularity in industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail.
Despite the progress made in tabular data generators, models trained with
synthetic data often underperform compared to those trained with original data.
This low SL utility of synthetic data stems from class imbalance exaggeration
and SL data relationship overlooked by tabular generator. To address these
challenges, we draw inspirations from techniques in emerging data-centric
artificial intelligence and elucidate Pruning and ReOrdering ('PRRO'), a novel
pipeline that integrates data-centric techniques into tabular data synthesis.
PRRO incorporates data pruning to guide the table generator towards
observations with high signal-to-noise ratio, ensuring that the class
distribution of synthetic data closely matches that of the original data.
Besides, PRRO employs a column reordering algorithm to align the data modeling
structure of generators with that of SL models. These two modules enable PRRO
to optimize SL utility of synthetic data. Empirical experiments on 22 public
datasets show that synthetic data generated using PRRO enhances predictive
performance compared to data generated without PRRO. Specifically, synthetic
replacement of original data yields an average improvement of 26.74% and up to
871.46% improvement using PRRO, while synthetic appendant to original data
results with PRRO-generated data results in an average improvement of 6.13% and
up to 200.32%. Furthermore, experiments on six highly imbalanced datasets show
that PRRO enables the generator to produce synthetic data with a class
distribution that resembles the original data more closely, achieving a
similarity improvement of 43%. Through PRRO, we foster a seamless integration
of data synthesis to subsequent SL prediction, promoting quality and accessible
data analysis.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from
suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about
importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a
variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance
reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the
distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under
general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We
theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order
stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an
additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the
expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the
horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent
sample complexity.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing

renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential

Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL's potential for robotic grasping is underexplored, with non-IID and low-quantity data causing performance issues.

Method: MTF-Grasp selects top-level robots with better data, trains seed models, and shares them with low-level robots.

Result: Outperforms conventional FL by 8% on skewed datasets like Cornell and Jacquard.

Conclusion: MTF-Grasp effectively mitigates performance degradation in FL for robotic grasping.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables
participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL
has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks
lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without
moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot
learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID)
and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in
robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL
approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the
non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness.
MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of
"top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It
then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them
to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance
degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL
setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping
datasets.

### [398] [Domain Borders Are There to Be Crossed With Federated Few-Shot Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10160)
*Manuel Röder,Christoph Raab,Frank-Michael Schleif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAcross+ is a scalable Federated Learning framework addressing challenges like data labeling, covariate shift, and resource constraints by leveraging a pre-trained model with frozen backbone and classifier, enabling efficient client adaptation in industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical implementation of Federated Learning faces challenges like costly data labeling, covariate shift, and resource constraints, necessitating a solution for real-world client adaptation.

Method: The framework uses a pre-trained source model with a frozen backbone and classifier, allowing an adaptive linear layer to handle domain adaptation, and extends to streaming data for non-stationary environments.

Result: FedAcross+ achieves competitive adaptation on low-end devices with limited samples and handles domain shift effectively, supporting sporadic model updates in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: FedAcross+ provides a practical and scalable solution for Federated Learning in industrial settings, addressing key challenges while ensuring efficient deployment.

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized,
privacy-preserving learning, particularly relevant in the era of interconnected
edge devices equipped with sensors. However, the practical implementation of
Federated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human
involvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate
shift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting
sensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the
impracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained
environments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical
constraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these
issues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework
tailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This
framework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an
adaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server. By freezing
the backbone and classifier during client adaptation on resource-constrained
devices, we allow the domain adaptive linear layer to handle target domain
adaptation, thus minimizing overall computational overhead. Furthermore, this
setup, designated as FedAcross+, is extended to encompass the processing of
streaming data, thereby rendering the solution suitable for non-stationary
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
FedAcross+ in achieving competitive adaptation on low-end client devices with
limited target samples, successfully addressing the challenge of domain shift.
Moreover, our framework accommodates sporadic model updates within
resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical and seamless deployment.

*Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Kriton Konstantinidis,Ilya Kisil,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies Tensor Network (TN) ranks, explaining their role in TN decompositions and how domain knowledge can guide their selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TN ranks are often misunderstood and treated as hyperparameters, lacking universal meaning or intuitive interpretation. The paper aims to clarify this concept.

Method: Uses real-life examples, intuitive visualizations, and a graphical approach to explain TN ranks, linking them to tensor unfoldings.

Result: Provides a unified understanding of TN ranks, facilitating their informed selection and deployment in practical applications.

Conclusion: The paper equips readers with clarity and intuition for using TN ranks in tensor methods, enhancing both application and education.

Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in
Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank
representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in
handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of
TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.
However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an
intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across
different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as
empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters
inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to
demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks
through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by
illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in
widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker
decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory
graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a
perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the
corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing
cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN
design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear
and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary
physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and
deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational
contexts.

TL;DR: Unsupervised CNN-LSTM autoencoder models are used to derive latent representations from low-level play traces in MicroRTS, reducing reliance on domain expertise and enabling diverse play style exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve game design and adaptive experiences by identifying play styles without heavy reliance on domain knowledge or handcrafted features.

Method: Unsupervised CNN-LSTM autoencoder models applied to low-level play trace data in MicroRTS.

Result: The approach successfully separates different game playing agents in the latent space, minimizing domain expertise bias.

Conclusion: The method enables effective exploration of diverse play styles in AI players, offering a less biased and more automated solution.

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and
enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents.
Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace
representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate
the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent
space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within
studied AI players.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-GRAB, a benchmark for evaluating Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) on synthetic tasks to assess their ability to handle temporal patterns like periodicity, causality, and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TGNNs lack clarity in capturing core temporal patterns, prompting the need for a systematic evaluation tool.

Method: The authors propose T-GRAB, a set of synthetic tasks isolating key temporal skills, and evaluate 11 TGNNs on these tasks.

Result: The evaluation reveals significant shortcomings in TGNNs' generalization of temporal patterns.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in current models, advocate for stronger temporal reasoning architectures, and provide actionable insights for future research.

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning methods have recently emerged as powerful tools for
modelling relational data evolving through time. However, despite extensive
benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as
periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we
introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set
of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs
to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that
isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions,
inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over
both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning
methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to
generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the
limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional
real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with
stronger temporal reasoning abilities. The code for T-GRAB can be found at:

Abstract: How can we learn a representation with high predictive power while preserving

sanitizing sensitive content from the learned representation. Specifically, we
introduce a variant of entropy - focal entropy, which mitigates the potential

feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at
moderate privacy leakage.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes neural networks using graph variables and statistical sufficiency, showing how layers preserve conditional distributions under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge statistical sufficiency, graph theory, and deep learning for a new understanding of neural networks.

Method: Formulates neural network layers as graph-based transformations, proving sufficiency under dense anchor points and finite-width assumptions.

Result: Asymptotic sufficiency holds in infinite-width limits, and finite-width networks achieve sufficiency with region-separated inputs.

Conclusion: The work provides a statistical framework for understanding neural networks, covering various architectures and activations.

Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical
sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations,
where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor
points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer
outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the
conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. Under
dense anchor point assumptions, we prove that asymptotic sufficiency holds in
the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. To align more
closely with practical architectures, we further show that sufficiency can be
achieved with finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input
distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. Our framework covers
fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid
activations, and convolutional neural networks. This work bridges statistical
sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a
new statistical understanding of neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAPI-ELM is introduced as an adaptive RBF-based extension of PI-ELM to solve PDE problems with sharp gradients, combining BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization for output layer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address PI-ELM's limitation in capturing sharp gradients due to fixed input layers, while preserving its speed advantage over PINNs.

Method: Uses a lightweight BO framework to learn hyperparameters defining the input weights' distribution, combined with least-squares optimization for output layer parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in forward and inverse PDE problems, outperforming methods like XTFC with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: KAPI-ELM is a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable framework, especially effective in stiff PDE regimes.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning
Machine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of
PI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform
the traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their
single-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their
fixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp
gradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian
Optimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer
parameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of
hyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input
weights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining
BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization
for output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's
speed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the
proposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,
including a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson
equation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.
Notably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and
inverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced
methods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while
requiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results
establish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and
generalizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE
regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE-T is a conditional generative chemical language model that integrates biological context for molecule prioritization and design, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative chemical language models lack reliable reward signals and interpretability, limiting their impact in drug discovery.

Method: SAFE-T models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given biological prompts, enabling scoring and goal-directed generation.

Result: SAFE-T achieves comparable or better performance than existing methods in zero-shot evaluations and is significantly faster.

Conclusion: SAFE-T demonstrates that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.

Abstract: Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains
limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of
interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical
modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein
targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without
relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T
models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a
biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such
as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff
detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this
learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In
comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,
ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being
significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T
captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and
biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these
results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and
generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.

*Shijie Li,Weiqiang He,Ruobing Bai,Pan Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sensitivity of hierarchical clustering in large, dynamic datasets, focusing on hierarchical $k$-median clustering. It proposes an efficient algorithm with low average sensitivity and high clustering quality, contrasting it with less stable methods like single linkage clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical clustering is widely used but sensitive to small dataset perturbations, reducing its usability in large, dynamic datasets. The study aims to improve stability and interpretability.

Method: The paper analyzes average sensitivity by measuring output changes when a random data point is deleted. It proposes an efficient hierarchical $k$-median clustering algorithm and compares it with single linkage and CLNSS variants.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates low average sensitivity and high clustering quality, outperforming less stable methods like single linkage and CLNSS.

Conclusion: The study validates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, highlighting its advantages over traditional methods in terms of stability and quality.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for unsupervised learning
with numerous applications. However, in the application of modern algorithms,
the datasets studied are usually large and dynamic. If the hierarchical
clustering is sensitive to small perturbations of the dataset, the usability of
the algorithm will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we focus on the
hierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and
centroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility,
and improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms
for this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random
data point is deleted. We propose an efficient algorithm for hierarchical
$k$-median clustering and theoretically prove its low average sensitivity and
high clustering quality. Additionally, we show that single linkage clustering
and a deterministic variant of the CLNSS algorithm exhibit high average
sensitivity, making them less stable. Finally, we validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments.

Motivation: Early dementia detection is crucial for timely intervention, but traditional neuropsychological tests rely on manual scoring. ADC systems aim to automate this process using speech recordings.

Method: Proposes Demenba, a state space model-based ADC framework, trained on 1,000+ hours of cognitive assessments from the Framingham Heart Study. It scales linearly with sequence length and integrates large language models.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 21% in fine-grained dementia classification, using fewer parameters. Shows additional improvement when fused with large language models.

Conclusion: Demenba offers a transparent and scalable solution for dementia assessment, paving the way for improved early detection tools.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and
improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for
cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic
dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly
from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework
based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation
with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments
administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were
diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms
prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using
fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that
our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models,
paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

*Herlock,Rahimi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes federated learning (FL) under intermittent and biased client participation, proving convergence for agnostic FedAvg without requiring knowledge of participation distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL deployments face challenges due to random and non-uniform client participation, which existing convergence analyses often ignore or oversimplify.

Method: The study characterizes the optimization problem for agnostic FedAvg under stochastic client availability, analyzing its convergence for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses.

Result: The paper achieves a convergence rate of O(1/√T) and shows agnostic FedAvg outperforms weighted aggregation variants, even with known participation weights.

Conclusion: Agnostic FedAvg provides robust convergence guarantees under general client participation, making it a practical choice for real-world FL deployments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without
centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key
realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation
and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing
convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on
knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions
that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization
problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known
\emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and
variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence
for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our
analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under
general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the
participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic
FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg
variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates imputation methods for missing MoCap data from IMUs, comparing statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. Multivariate methods outperform univariate ones, especially for complex missingness patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in IMU-derived MoCap compromises its utility in sports science, and there's a lack of systematic evaluation of imputation methods for such data.

Method: A comparative analysis of imputation methods (statistical, ML, DL) is conducted on a new MoCap dataset from 53 karate practitioners, simulating three missingness mechanisms: MCAR, block missingness, and value-dependent patterns.

Result: Multivariate frameworks outperform univariate methods, reducing MAE by up to 50% for complex missingness. GAIN and Iterative Imputers show the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a benchmark for future research and practical recommendations to enhance MoCap data integrity.

Abstract: Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often
compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a
systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is
lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis
of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our
evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,
multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To
facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap
dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate
practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing
completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent
pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic
variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks
consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex
missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean
absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate
techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative
Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the
highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical
baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving
the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.

Abstract: This paper examines the $L_p$ and $W^1_p$ norm approximation errors of ReLU
neural networks for Korobov functions. In terms of network width and depth, we
derive nearly optimal super-approximation error bounds of order $2m$ in the
$L_p$ norm and order $2m-2$ in the $W^1_p$ norm, for target functions with
$L_p$ mixed derivative of order $m$ in each direction. The analysis leverages

improve upon classical lowest order $L_\infty$ and $H^1$ norm error bounds and
demonstrate that the expressivity of neural networks is largely unaffected by
the curse of dimensionality.

TL;DR: An algorithm is designed to accelerate diffusion on the $SO(3)$ manifold, achieving up to 4.9× speed-up without degrading task reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are inherently slow due to their sequential nature, requiring faster denoising for perturbed data.

Method: Adapts numerical Picard iteration for the $SO(3)$ space and demonstrates it on a pose ambiguity problem.

Result: Achieves up to 4.9× speed-up in sample generation with no measurable degradation in task reward.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively accelerates diffusion on $SO(3)$ without compromising performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on
the $SO(3)$ manifold. The inherently sequential nature of diffusion models
necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this
limitation, we proposed to adapt the numerical Picard iteration for the $SO(3)$
space. We demonstrate our algorithm on an existing method that employs
diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that
this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task
reward. The experiments reveal that our algorithm achieves a speed-up of up to
4.9$\times$, significantly reducing the latency for generating a single sample.

### [412] [Feature Distillation is the Better Choice for Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10348)
*Yichen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFD introduces feature distillation in Hetero-FL to address knowledge bias from heterogeneous models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hetero-FL methods using logit distillation fail to compensate for knowledge bias from heterogeneous models, leading to unstable training.

Method: Proposes FedFD, a feature distillation approach using orthogonal projection to align features and mitigate bias.

Result: FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Feature distillation with orthogonal projection effectively integrates knowledge from heterogeneous models, improving stability and performance.

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing
attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models
while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,
ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often
employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global
model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not
always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The
reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,
while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for
the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous
Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature
information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous
models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge
distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to
maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align
the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize
the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and
thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT) for multi-horizon time series forecasting, improving peak demand prediction by 30% using context variables like holidays and promotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain management, especially during high-stake sales events with unpredictable demand peaks.

Method: TAT uses an encoder-decoder architecture with Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA) to leverage context variables (e.g., holidays, promotions) for better alignment in peak demand forecasting.

Result: TAT achieves up to 30% accuracy improvement in peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: TAT effectively addresses the challenge of peak demand forecasting, enhancing supply chain operations and customer experience.

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as
demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying
and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical
retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons
extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales
events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately.
However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain
operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a
multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as
holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance.
Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel
Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent
alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis
on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We
demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand
forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Yongjin Choi,Chenying Liu,Jorge Macedo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepONet architectures are evaluated for 1D consolidation, with Model 4 (Fourier feature-enhanced) outperforming others and showing significant computational speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand DeepONet applications in geotechnical engineering by addressing limitations in modeling rapidly varying solutions.

Method: Evaluated four DeepONet architectures, including a physics-inspired trunk net and a Fourier feature-enhanced version, for 1D consolidation.

Result: Model 4 outperformed others, achieving speedups of 1.5 to 100 times over traditional solvers.

Conclusion: DeepONets show promise for efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnics, advancing scientific machine learning integration.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a powerful surrogate
modeling framework for learning solution operators in PDE-governed systems.
While their use is expanding across engineering disciplines, applications in
geotechnical engineering remain limited. This study systematically evaluates
several DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem.
We initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the
coefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a
physics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net
(Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations
(Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess
pore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses
the identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed
architectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional
explicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger
computational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored
1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
DeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical
applications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in
geotechnics, which is at an early stage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform integrates a mobile app for personalized route recommendations, evaluated for optimization and RAG framework performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for e-mobility and the need for comprehensive solutions drive the development of advanced, realistic traffic simulations and intelligent decision-making tools.

Method: The platform combines cloud-based traffic simulation with an LLM-powered RAG framework, evaluated for travel time, cost, and schema-level accuracy.

Result: The system achieves 0.81 accuracy for operator queries and 0.98 for user queries using XiYanSQL.

Conclusion: The platform effectively addresses e-mobility demands with robust optimization and high accuracy in user interactions.

Abstract: With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous
advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic
simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic
representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as
pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including
intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis.
As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive

cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile
application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is
evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios.
Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level

XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator
queries and 0.98 on user queries.

*Md. Ahsanul Kabir,Mohammad Al Hasan,Aritra Mandal,Liyang Hao,Ishita Khan,Daniel Tunkelang,Zhe Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TagBERT, a dependency-aware transformer model for query reformulation in e-commerce, leveraging semantic tags to improve relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like ambiguous queries and vocabulary misalignment in e-commerce search by enhancing query reformulation methods.

Method: Proposes TagBERT, a token classification model using semantic tags for better query phrase embeddings.

Result: TagBERT outperforms BERT, eBERT, and sequence-to-sequence models on real e-commerce datasets.

Conclusion: Semantic tags significantly improve query reformulation, with TagBERT demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most
relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a
query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous
queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or
under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To
address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user
query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to
bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early
methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from
token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or
purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically
transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are
being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize
the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user
intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a
token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware
transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of
a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,
real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance
than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and
Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.

*Nicholas Casetti,Dylan Anstine,Olexandr Isayev,Connor W. Coley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A strategy combining graph-based enumeration and machine learning is proposed to simplify reaction mechanism searches for complex cyclizations, using a neural network potential (AIMNet2-rxn) for accurate pathway evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex reactions with multiple concerted bond changes, common in natural product synthesis, complicate mechanism searches. The goal is to expedite exploration of such reactions, particularly cyclizations.

Method: The approach combines graph-based enumeration schemes with machine learning for intermediate filtering, using AIMNet2-rxn for computational evaluation of reaction pathways.

Result: The method accurately estimates activation energies, predicts stereoselectivity, and recapitulates key steps in natural product synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively addresses challenges in complex reaction mechanism searches, demonstrating practical utility in natural product synthesis.

Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide
insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems.
However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found
in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search
process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search
strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary
family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective
strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining
graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for
intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network
potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate
reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate
activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity,
and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.

TL;DR: A novel framework, Stochastic Operator Network (SON), combines stochastic optimal control with DeepONet for uncertainty quantification in operator learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in operator learning by integrating stochastic control concepts.

Method: Formulates the branch net as an SDE and uses adjoint BSDE for SGD updates, leveraging the Stochastic Maximum Principle.

Result: SON effectively replicates noisy operators in 2D and 3D, demonstrating its capability to learn uncertainty.

Conclusion: SON provides a robust method for uncertainty quantification in operator learning through stochastic control principles.

Abstract: We develop a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in operator
learning, the Stochastic Operator Network (SON). SON combines the stochastic
optimal control concepts of the Stochastic Neural Network (SNN) with the
DeepONet. By formulating the branch net as an SDE and backpropagating through
the adjoint BSDE, we replace the gradient of the loss function with the
gradient of the Hamiltonian from Stohastic Maximum Principle in the SGD update.
This allows SON to learn the uncertainty present in operators through its
diffusion parameters. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of SON when
replicating several noisy operators in 2D and 3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance energy efficiency and performance in AI/ML models, particularly for DeepRX, addressing the trade-offs in energy consumption during training and inference.

Method: Evaluates DeepRX's energy usage (FLOPs/Watt, FLOPs/clock), validates estimates, and employs knowledge distillation to train a compact student model with optimized hyperparameters.

Result: Distilled student models achieve lower error floors across SINR levels, proving KD's effectiveness for energy-efficient AI.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation successfully reduces energy consumption in DeepRX while maintaining performance, offering a viable solution for energy-efficient AI.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with
performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based
on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy
consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and
FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,
influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy
dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the
application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX
\textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher}
model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student
model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is
measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus
Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and
a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error
floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving
energy-efficient AI solutions.

### [420] [Non-exchangeable Conformal Prediction with Optimal Transport: Tackling Distribution Shifts with Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10425)
*Alvaro H. C. Correia,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores conformal prediction's limitations under distribution shifts and proposes an optimal transport-based method to estimate and mitigate coverage loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction's guarantees rely on exchangeable data, but distribution shifts often violate this, leading to coverage loss. Existing methods require prior knowledge of the shift type.

Method: The study uses optimal transport to analyze and address coverage loss in non-exchangeable settings caused by distribution shifts.

Result: The proposed method can estimate and mitigate coverage loss without prior knowledge of the distribution shift type.

Conclusion: Optimal transport offers a promising approach to handle distribution shifts in conformal prediction, improving its robustness.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method
that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its
finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split
conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to
collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet
seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration
and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and
often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature
is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable
setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of
distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this
problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show
that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of
distribution shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLA is a novel SSL method for online continual learning that aligns current and past representations to reduce forgetting, improving convergence and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of SSL techniques for online continual learning, where data arrives in small batches, computational resources are limited, and task boundaries are unclear.

Method: Introduces Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), which aligns current model representations with past ones to mitigate forgetting.

Result: CLA speeds up training convergence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same budget. It also enhances final performance when used as pretraining.

Conclusion: CLA is effective for online continual learning, offering faster convergence and better performance than existing methods, even improving pretraining outcomes.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the shortcomings of current VLMs in basic visual tasks and identify design components that may be lacking.

Method: Constructed a series of tests to probe VLM performance, comparing it to probes trained on visual encoder features, vision-language projection, and LLM-decoder output.

Result: Uncovered specific shortcomings in VLMs, providing insights into their capabilities, robustness, and visual information processing.

Conclusion: The findings aim to guide future improvements in VLMs by highlighting areas needing enhancement.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for
addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been
shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual
understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations
of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that
probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we
go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final
performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the
performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual
encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In
doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important
observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual
information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving
VLMs.

### [423] [Some remarks on gradient dominance and LQR policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10452)
*Eduardo D. Sontag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the Polyak-Łojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) and its generalizations to analyze convergence rates in optimization, highlighting gaps between continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) behaviors and addressing gradient estimation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mixed globally linear / locally exponential convergence behavior in optimization problems, particularly in policy optimization for reinforcement learning, and to bridge the gap between CT and DT behaviors.

Method: The method involves applying and generalizing the PLI to analyze convergence rates, including an input-to-state stability (ISS) analysis for gradient estimation errors.

Result: The results reveal a disparity in convergence rates between CT and DT problems and provide insights into the effects of gradient estimation errors.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generalized PLI-like conditions are crucial for understanding convergence and stability in optimization, especially under imperfect gradient information.

Abstract: Solutions of optimization problems, including policy optimization in
reinforcement learning, typically rely upon some variant of gradient descent.
There has been much recent work in the machine learning, control, and
optimization communities applying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) to
such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a.
``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis)
of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the
case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate
vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /
locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time
LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT
and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like
conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these
generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects
of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from
adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a
simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic
computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from
limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of
this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of
``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv
skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in
collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping
Jiang, and Milad Siami.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Target Polish,' a fast and robust framework for nonnegative matrix/tensor factorization, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional weighted NMF methods are slow due to multiplicative updates, despite outlier resistance. Target Polish aims to retain robustness while improving efficiency.

Method: Target Polish integrates a weighted median-based transformation with Fast-HALS, enabling outlier resistance without sacrificing speed.

Result: Empirical tests show Target Polish matches/exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy and reduces computation time significantly.

Conclusion: Target Polish offers a robust, efficient alternative to traditional NMF methods, balancing speed and outlier resistance.

Abstract: This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally
efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although
conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge
slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective
criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the
Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing
the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides
outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update
structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted
with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the
Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art
robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in
the studied scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, comparing it with L2 regularization and SGD. Results show EWC reduces forgetting but slightly hampers new task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, inspired by biological synaptic consolidation, and validate EWC's effectiveness in supervised learning.

Method: Replicates and extends prior research using PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST benchmarks, comparing EWC with L2 regularization and SGD.

Result: EWC significantly reduces forgetting compared to naive training, though it slightly compromises new task learning efficiency. Dropout and hyperparameters' impact is also analyzed.

Conclusion: EWC is a promising solution for lifelong learning in neural networks, balancing knowledge retention and adaptability.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual
learning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn
multiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight
Consolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic
consolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this
problem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating
EWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST
benchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how
different approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability. Our results
confirm what was shown in previous research, showing that EWC significantly
reduces forgetting compared to naive training while slightly compromising
learning efficiency on new tasks. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
dropout regularization and varying hyperparameters, offering insights into the
generalization of EWC across diverse learning scenarios. These results
underscore EWC's potential as a viable solution for lifelong learning in neural
networks.

TL;DR: SplitHappens enhances Split Learning (SL) with Function Secret Sharing (FSS) in a U-shaped SL setup, improving security and efficiency while protecting client data labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in SL by combining it with FSS to enhance data privacy and security against attacks like model inversion and label inference.

Method: U-shaped SL with FSS, reducing communication and computational costs while keeping labels secret.

Result: Improved security, reduced training time, and lower communication costs without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: SplitHappens offers a robust and efficient solution for secure SL, generalizing security analysis and addressing modern attack vectors.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) -- splits a model into two distinct parts to help protect
client data while enhancing Machine Learning (ML) processes. Though promising,
SL has proven vulnerable to different attacks, thus raising concerns about how
effective it may be in terms of data privacy. Recent works have shown promising
results for securing SL through the use of a novel paradigm, named Function
Secret Sharing (FSS), in which servers obtain shares of a function they compute
and operate on a public input hidden with a random mask. However, these works
fall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In
SplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL. Similarly
to other works, we are able to make use of the benefits of SL by reducing the
communication and computational costs of FSS. However, a U-shaped SL provides a
higher security guarantee than previous works, allowing a client to keep the
labels of the training data secret, without having to share them with the
server. Through this, we are able to generalize the security analysis of
previous works and expand it to different attack vectors, such as modern model
inversion attacks as well as label inference attacks. We tested our approach
for two different convolutional neural networks on different datasets. These
experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training
time as well as the communication costs when compared to simply using FSS while
matching prior accuracy.

Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks in AI for biology hinders the development of trustworthy models, prompting a workshop to address these gaps.

Method: Workshop insights from ML and computational biology experts identified bottlenecks and proposed solutions like high-quality data curation and standardized tools.

Result: Key challenges include data heterogeneity, biases, and fragmented resources. Recommendations focus on benchmarking frameworks for cross-domain comparisons.

Conclusion: Robust benchmarks will ensure rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, advancing AI-driven discoveries in cellular systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a
lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build
robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop
that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across
imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We
identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity
and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of
publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building
benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological
systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data
curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open,
collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust
benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for
ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately
advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries,
therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how private learning algorithms perform under heavy-tail class imbalance, focusing on low-frequency classes.

Method: Analyzed DP-GD and DP-AdamBC in a stylized model and real data, comparing their optimization behaviors.

Result: DP-AdamBC outperforms DP-GD, improving training accuracy for rare classes by ~8% (controlled) and ~5% (real data).

Conclusion: DP-AdamBC is effective for heavy-tail imbalance, mitigating DP bias and improving rare-class learning.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the optimization behaviour of common private
learning optimization algorithms under heavy-tail class imbalanced
distribution. We show that, in a stylized model, optimizing with Gradient
Descent with differential privacy (DP-GD) suffers when learning low-frequency
classes, whereas optimization algorithms that estimate second-order information
do not. In particular, DP-AdamBC that removes the DP bias from estimating loss
curvature is a crucial component to avoid the ill-condition caused by
heavy-tail class imbalance, and empirically fits the data better with
$\approx8\%$ and $\approx5\%$ increase in training accuracy when learning the
least frequent classes on both controlled experiments and real data
respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph World Model (GWM), a versatile model handling both unstructured and graph-structured data for multi-modal tasks, outperforming domain-specific baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models lack support for structured data (graphs) and multi-modal tasks, limiting their applicability.

Method: GWM uses a generic message-passing algorithm for structured data, with two variants (GWM-T and GWM-E) for multi-modal integration and action nodes for task diversity.

Result: GWM excels in six diverse tasks, showing superior performance, multi-hop benefits, and zero-shot/few-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: GWM bridges the gap between unstructured and structured data, offering a unified solution for multi-modal and interdisciplinary tasks.

Abstract: World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,

*Tao Feng,Haozhen Zhang,Zijie Lei,Pengrui Han,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionBench and FusionFactory propose systematic fusion of multiple LLMs to leverage their complementary strengths, outperforming single-model approaches across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current applications rely on single LLMs, limiting performance and efficiency. LLM routing data reveals untapped potential for combining models' strengths.

Method: FusionBench benchmarks 20 LLMs across 14 tasks. FusionFactory introduces query-, thought-, and model-level fusion to combine models' outputs and capabilities.

Result: FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations varying by task.

Conclusion: Systematic LLM fusion harnesses complementary strengths, improving performance and efficiency in complex tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant
ecosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to
differences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most
applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of
capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when
tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing
data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different
models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,
we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks
across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing
103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.
Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework
with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query
using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level
fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers
to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities
between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as
training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best
individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations
varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in
harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance degradation in Neural DNF models during symbolic translation by proposing a disentanglement method to preserve model performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in Neural DNF models during symbolic translation due to failure in disentangling learned knowledge.

Method: Proposes a disentanglement method by splitting nodes encoding nested rules into smaller independent nodes.

Result: Improved performance and interpretability in binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks.

Conclusion: The disentanglement method enhances Neural DNF models, maintaining performance closer to pre-translation levels while providing compact, interpretable logical representations.

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and
interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising
results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior
knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the
thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here
that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its
failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the
networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement
method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent
nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through
experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks
(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our
disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical
representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to
that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study introduces three new centrality metrics (DIC, MVC, PC) to address limitations of traditional methods in tracking health misinformation on social networks, showing improved detection and mitigation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of health misinformation during crises like COVID-19 challenges public health and trust, requiring better tools to understand and mitigate its flow.

Method: Three novel centrality metrics (DIC, MVC, PC) were developed and compared with traditional methods using the FibVID and Monant datasets to identify influential nodes and pathways.

Result: New metrics identified 24 unique nodes (44.83% increase) and improved misinformation reduction from 50% to 62.5%. Validation on a second dataset confirmed broader applicability.

Conclusion: Combining traditional and novel centrality metrics provides a more robust framework for understanding and mitigating health misinformation in diverse online networks.

Abstract: The rapid spread of health misinformation on online social networks (OSNs)
during global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to public
health, social stability, and institutional trust. Centrality metrics have long
been pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in
the context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and
dynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the
limitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares
three novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health
misinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC).
These metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered
network interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and
novel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and
misinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential
nodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42
combined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health
misinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to
62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the
proposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant
Medical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation
discussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics
generalised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured
by traditional methods. In general, the findings suggest that a combination of
traditional and novel centrality measures offers a more robust and
generalisable framework for understanding and mitigating the spread of health
misinformation in different online network contexts.

Result: The model achieved 97.37% accuracy, and a combined feature-engineered version reached 98.88% precision and 99.80% recall.

Conclusion: ELM features enhance misinformation detection, showcasing the value of psychological theories in machine learning for public health.

Abstract: Health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly
challenged public health efforts globally. This study applies the Elaboration
Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media
using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability
of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text
readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation
frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of
96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined
model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving
a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of
99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving
detection performance, offering valuable contextual information. This study
demonstrates the practical application of psychological theories in developing
advanced machine learning algorithms to address health misinformation
effectively.

Motivation: To improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in fluid antenna multiple access by addressing the port selection challenge with limited observations.

Method: Frames port selection as a multi-label classification task, employs LNNs for prediction, and uses hyperparameter optimization for LNN refinement under α-μ fading.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods with lower outage probability values.

Conclusion: LNNs effectively optimize port selection in fluid antenna systems, enhancing performance in wireless communication.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems represent an innovative approach in wireless
communication, recently applied in multiple access to optimize the

frames the port selection problem as a multi-label classification task for the
first time, improving best-port selection with limited port observations. We
address this challenge by leveraging liquid neural networks (LNNs) to predict

TL;DR: An AI-driven method discovers a resilience theory for complex networks, combining topology and dynamics, improving accuracy by 37.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current resilience theories focus only on topology, ignoring dynamics, limiting understanding of network collapses.

Method: AI learns from network dismantling problems, symbolizing attack strategies into theoretical formulas.

Result: Discovered a resilience theory integrating topology and dynamics, refining existing theories with 37.5% better accuracy.

Conclusion: The AI approach advances human understanding of network resilience, aiding in early collapse warnings.

Abstract: Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external
perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can
swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes.
Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to
prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial
crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience
theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting
the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the
coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human
analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory
discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling
problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas.
This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory
that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation
between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering
insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses.
Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing
well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy,
significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deepfake technologies poses significant risks to political communication and democratic processes, prompting the need for effective regulatory and technical solutions.

Method: The study conducts a multivocal literature review to summarize methods for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes, assessing their effectiveness under EU regulation.

Result: Individual methods fall short of regulatory and practical requirements, leading to the proposal of a scalable, multi-level strategy with a simple scoring mechanism.

Conclusion: A multi-level approach combining existing methods is recommended for practical, scalable, and context-aware deepfake management under EU regulation.

Abstract: The growing availability and use of deepfake technologies increases risks for
democratic societies, e.g., for political communication on online platforms.
The EU has responded with transparency obligations for providers and deployers
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and online platforms. This includes
marking deepfakes during generation and labeling deepfakes when they are
shared. However, the lack of industry and enforcement standards poses an
ongoing challenge. Through a multivocal literature review, we summarize methods
for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes and assess their effectiveness
under EU regulation. Our results indicate that individual methods fail to meet
regulatory and practical requirements. Therefore, we propose a multi-level
strategy combining the strengths of existing methods. To account for the masses
of content on online platforms, our multi-level strategy provides scalability
and practicality via a simple scoring mechanism. At the same time, it is
agnostic to types of deepfake technology and allows for context-specific risk

Motivation: The global integration of LLMs into judicial systems reveals a gap between technical consistency and social acceptance, necessitating a solution.

Method: Analyzes 2023-2025 LLM judicial application data and introduces the DTDMR-LJGF framework for task classification and stakeholder interaction.

Result: Identifies the dual effects of LLM consistency and proposes a governance framework to address the divergence.

Conclusion: The DTDMR-LJGF provides a balanced approach for LLM judicial ecosystems, merging technical and social considerations.

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial
systems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this
global transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate
attention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability
divergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical
consistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the
technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative
effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial
applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge
requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study
proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance
Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and
meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both
theoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial
ecosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how engineers can integrate ML into their decision-making while adhering to legal and ethical frameworks, using analogical reasoning and existing liability doctrines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between ML adoption in engineering and unclear legal/regulatory frameworks creates uncertainty for engineers and stakeholders.

Method: The study uses analogical reasoning, analyzes liability doctrines (negligence, product liability), and examines legal precedents and legislative guidance.

Result: The paper proposes a legal framework for ML integration, balancing accountability, safety, and legitimacy in engineering practice.

Conclusion: Understanding the interplay between technical and legal aspects is crucial for legitimizing ML in engineering, with a proposed framework to guide stakeholders.

Abstract: Despite the widespread interest in machine learning (ML), the engineering
industry has not yet fully adopted ML-based methods, which has left engineers
and stakeholders uncertain about the legal and regulatory frameworks that
govern their decisions. This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's
decision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and
practical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To
bridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal
principles and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the
deployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences
gained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can
provide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while
maintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In
exploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability
doctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts
have evaluated the use of predictive models. We further analyze how legislative
bodies and standard-setting organizations can furnish explicit guidance
equivalent to prior endorsements of emergent technologies. This exploration
stresses the vitality of understanding the interplay between technical
justifications and legal precedents for shaping an informed stance on ML's
legitimacy in engineering practice. Finally, our analysis catalyzes a legal
framework for integrating ML through which stakeholders can critically assess
the responsibilities, liabilities, and benefits inherent in ML-driven
engineering solutions.

TL;DR: DiffNMR is a diffusion-based framework for interpreting NMR spectra to deduce molecular structures, outperforming autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting NMR spectra for molecular structure elucidation is complex due to spectral data intricacy and vast chemical space.

Method: Uses a conditional discrete diffusion model, two-stage pretraining (Diff-AE and contrastive learning), retrieval initialization, similarity filtering, and an NMR encoder with RBF encoding.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in NMR-based structure elucidation.

Conclusion: DiffNMR provides an efficient, robust solution for automated molecular analysis.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a central characterization
method for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting NMR spectra to
deduce molecular structures remains challenging due to the complexity of
spectral data and the vastness of the chemical space. In this work, we
introduce DiffNMR, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages a conditional
discrete diffusion model for de novo molecular structure elucidation from NMR
spectra. DiffNMR refines molecular graphs iteratively through a diffusion-based
generative process, ensuring global consistency and mitigating error
accumulation inherent in autoregressive methods. The framework integrates a
two-stage pretraining strategy that aligns spectral and molecular
representations via diffusion autoencoder (Diff-AE) and contrastive learning,
the incorporation of retrieval initialization and similarity filtering during
inference, and a specialized NMR encoder with radial basis function (RBF)
encoding for chemical shifts, preserving continuity and chemical correlation.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffNMR achieves competitive performance
for NMR-based structure elucidation, offering an efficient and robust solution
for automated molecular analysis.

TL;DR: TS-GEN is a generative model for predicting transition-state structures with high accuracy and speed, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transition-state structures are critical for understanding chemical reactivity but are difficult to experimentally capture, leading to reliance on costly DFT calculations.

Method: TS-GEN uses a conditional flow-matching generative model to directly map Gaussian prior samples to transition-state geometries, leveraging reactant and product conformations as conditioning information.

Result: TS-GEN achieves a root-mean-square deviation of 0.004 Å and a mean barrier-height error of 1.019 kcal/mol, with 87% of generated TSs meeting chemical-accuracy criteria.

Conclusion: TS-GEN offers high precision, speed, and broad applicability, enabling efficient exploration of complex reaction networks and novel mechanisms.

Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy
barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them
experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a
conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple
Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a
single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product
conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent
noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively
replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or
string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a
root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\
\rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error
of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only
$0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet
chemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially
outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to
out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom
precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly
useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the
way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.

*Xiangwang Hou,Jingjing Wang,Jun Du,Chunxiao Jiang,Yong Ren,Dusit Niyato*

TL;DR: A lightweight federated learning (LTFL) framework is proposed, integrating power control, model pruning, and gradient quantization to address challenges in wireless networks. It optimizes convergence gap under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized ML raises privacy and communication concerns; FL at the network edge is challenging in wireless settings.

Method: Proposes LTFL with power control, pruning, and quantization. Derives convergence gap expression and solves optimization for minimal gap under constraints.

Result: LTFL outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The LTFL framework effectively balances performance and constraints in wireless FL deployment.

Abstract: With the exponential growth of smart devices connected to wireless networks,
data production is increasing rapidly, requiring machine learning (ML)
techniques to unlock its value. However, the centralized ML paradigm raises
concerns over communication overhead and privacy. Federated learning (FL)
offers an alternative at the network edge, but practical deployment in wireless
networks remains challenging. This paper proposes a lightweight FL (LTFL)
framework integrating wireless transmission power control, model pruning, and
gradient quantization. We derive a closed-form expression of the FL convergence
gap, considering transmission error, model pruning error, and gradient
quantization error. Based on these insights, we formulate an optimization
problem to minimize the convergence gap while meeting delay and energy
constraints. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we derive closed-form
solutions for the optimal model pruning ratio and gradient quantization level,
and employ Bayesian optimization for transmission power control. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets show that LTFL outperforms state-of-the-art
schemes.

TL;DR: FedDHAD framework improves FL by addressing data heterogeneity and device limitations, achieving higher accuracy, speed, and lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges like non-IID data and stragglers due to device limitations, leading to accuracy drops and slow convergence.

Method: Proposes FedDH for dynamic model aggregation and FedAD for adaptive dropout to handle heterogeneity and improve efficiency.

Result: FedDHAD outperforms state-of-the-art with 6.7% higher accuracy, 2.02x speed, and 15.0% lower cost.

Conclusion: FedDHAD effectively tackles FL challenges, offering superior performance in accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning approach
that enables collaborative training of a global model using multiple edge
devices. The data distributed among the edge devices is highly heterogeneous.
Thus, FL faces the challenge of data distribution and heterogeneity, where
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across edge devices
may yield in significant accuracy drop. Furthermore, the limited computation
and communication capabilities of edge devices increase the likelihood of
stragglers, thus leading to slow model convergence. In this paper, we propose
the FedDHAD FL framework, which comes with two novel methods: Dynamic
Heterogeneous model aggregation (FedDH) and Adaptive Dropout (FedAD). FedDH
dynamically adjusts the weights of each local model within the model
aggregation process based on the non-IID degree of heterogeneous data to deal
with the statistical data heterogeneity. FedAD performs neuron-adaptive
operations in response to heterogeneous devices to improve accuracy while
achieving superb efficiency. The combination of these two methods makes FedDHAD
significantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy (up to
6.7% higher), efficiency (up to 2.02 times faster), and computation cost (up to
15.0% smaller).

TL;DR: ElasticMM introduces Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP) to efficiently serve MLLMs by dynamically adapting resources and decoupling inference stages, reducing latency and improving throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM serving architectures struggle with mixed request types and inefficient resource use, leading to high latency and poor performance.

Method: Proposes EMP, a paradigm for elastic resource adaptation, and develops ElasticMM with modality-aware load balancing, elastic partition scheduling, and multimodal prefix caching.

Result: ElasticMM reduces TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieves 3.2-4.5x higher throughput compared to SOTA systems.

Conclusion: ElasticMM effectively addresses MLLM serving challenges, offering significant performance improvements and meeting SLOs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images,
videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules.
However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference
pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference
overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge.
Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between
mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference
stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor
resource utilization. To address this, we propose Elastic Multimodal
Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource
heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we
develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into
independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a
modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables
parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling;
and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching
and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that
ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by
up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level
objectives (SLOs).

TL;DR: Dynamic GUS extends Grale for dynamic data, enabling low-latency graph updates with applications like faster harmful app detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like Grale are inefficient for dynamic data, and ANN systems lack multi-feature support.

Method: Introduces Dynamic GUS, combining Grale's quality with ScaNN for dynamic updates.

Result: Achieves tens of milliseconds latency per request, with 10+ Google deployments, including 4x faster harmful app detection.

Conclusion: Dynamic GUS successfully addresses the gap for dynamic, multi-feature graph construction with low latency.

Abstract: Learning and constructing large-scale graphs has attracted attention in
recent decades, resulting in a rich literature that introduced various systems,
tools, and algorithms. Grale is one of such tools that is designed for offline
environments and is deployed in more than 50 different industrial settings at
Google. Grale is widely applicable because of its ability to efficiently learn
and construct a graph on datasets with multiple types of features. However, it
is often the case that applications require the underlying data to evolve
continuously and rapidly and the updated graph needs to be available with low
latency. Such setting make the use of Grale prohibitive. While there are
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) systems that handle dynamic updates with low
latency, they are mostly limited to similarities over a single embedding.
  In this work, we introduce a system that inherits the advantages and the
quality of Grale, and maintains a graph construction in a dynamic setting with
tens of milliseconds of latency per request. We call the system Dynamic Grale
Using ScaNN (Dynamic GUS). Our system has a wide range of applications with
over 10 deployments at Google. One of the applications is in Android Security
and Privacy, where Dynamic Grale Using ScaNN enables capturing harmful
applications 4 times faster, before they can reach users.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that learning low-dimensional chaotic systems from noise-free data with high precision is achievable using polynomial regression and high-precision arithmetic, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark and improve system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data, focusing on noise-free observations in chaotic systems.

Method: Uses ordinary least squares regression on high-degree polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic to learn dynamics.

Result: Achieves prediction times of 32 to 105 Lyapunov times for Lorenz-63, surpassing prior work (max 13 Lyapunov times). Validated on more complex systems like Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor and Lorenz-96.

Conclusion: Learning low-dimensional chaotic systems from noise-free data is effectively solved with the proposed method.

Abstract: Low-dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz-63 model are commonly used
to benchmark system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data. Here we
show that learning from noise-free observations in such systems can be achieved
up to machine precision: using ordinary least squares regression on high-degree
polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic, our method exceeds the accuracy of
standard 64-bit numerical ODE solvers of the true underlying dynamical systems.
Depending on the configuration, we obtain valid prediction times of 32 to 105
Lyapunov times for the Lorenz-63 system, dramatically outperforming prior work
that reaches 13 Lyapunov times at most. We further validate our results on
Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor, a non-polynomial chaotic system that is
considerably more complex than the Lorenz-63 model, and show that similar
results extend also to higher dimensions using the spatiotemporally chaotic
Lorenz-96 model. Our findings suggest that learning low-dimensional chaotic
systems from noise-free data is a solved problem.

TL;DR: CNeuroMod-THINGS combines THINGS and CNeuroMod projects to create a large-scale fMRI dataset for modeling human visual experience using densely-sampled neural responses to annotated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for larger neuroimaging datasets to support data-hungry neuro-AI modeling by leveraging existing resources.

Method: Integrates THINGS' annotated images with CNeuroMod's fMRI data collection, involving four participants in 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using 4000 images across 720 categories.

Result: Produces high-quality behavioural and neuroimaging metrics, demonstrating the dataset's robustness.

Conclusion: CNeuroMod-THINGS enhances modeling capabilities for human visual experience by combining large existing datasets.

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets.
CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide
set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new
densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS
exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative
(THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has
developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural
and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of
large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring
hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during
controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching
and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each
completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using
approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories.
We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the
data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands
our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

*Yanchen Wang,Han Yu,Ari Blau,Yizi Zhang,The International Brain Laboratory,Liam Paninski,Cole Hurwitz,Matt Whiteway*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: BEAST is a scalable framework using self-supervised pretraining of transformers to improve behavioral analysis in neuroscience, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding behavior is key to neuroscience, but current video analysis methods rely on labeled data, which is scarce.

Method: BEAST combines masked autoencoding and temporal contrastive learning to pretrain vision transformers on unlabeled video data.

Result: BEAST outperforms in behavioral feature extraction, pose estimation, and action segmentation across species.

Conclusion: BEAST provides a versatile backbone model for behavioral analysis, especially where labeled data is limited.

Abstract: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it
generates -- a guiding principle in modern neuroscience research that
nevertheless presents significant technical challenges. Many studies capture
behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on
specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation
with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of
Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains
experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses.
BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to
effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation
across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical
neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with
neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the
single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and
versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios
where labeled data remains scarce.

### [448] [Energy Dissipation Rate Guided Adaptive Sampling for Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Resolving Surface-Bulk Dynamics in Allen-Cahn Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09757)
*Chunyan Li,Wenkai Yu,Qi Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: EDRAS enhances PINNs for solving PDEs by using energy dissipation rate to guide adaptive sampling, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PINN performance in solving thermodynamically consistent PDEs by aligning training with physical structure.

Method: EDRAS uses local energy dissipation rate to dynamically re-sample critical collocation points.

Result: Achieves up to sixfold error reduction compared to RAR and identifies high-impact points more efficiently.

Conclusion: EDRAS makes PINNs more robust for complex thermodynamic processes in arbitrary geometries.

Abstract: We introduce the Energy Dissipation Rate guided Adaptive Sampling (EDRAS)
strategy, a novel method that substantially enhances the performance of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving thermodynamically
consistent partial differential equations (PDEs) over arbitrary domains. EDRAS
leverages the local energy dissipation rate density as a guiding metric to
identify and adaptively re-sample critical collocation points from both the
interior and boundary of the computational domain. This dynamical sampling
approach improves the accuracy of residual-based PINNs by aligning the training
process with the underlying physical structure of the system. In this study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of EDRAS using the Allen-Cahn phase field model
in irregular geometries, achieving up to a sixfold reduction in the relative
mean square error compared to traditional residual-based adaptive refinement
(RAR) methods. Moreover, we compare EDRAS with other residual-based adaptive
sampling approaches and show that EDRAS is not only computationally more
efficient but also more likely to identify high-impact collocation points.
Through numerical solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation with both static
(Neumann) and dynamic boundary conditions in 2D disk- and ellipse-shaped
domains solved using PINN coupled with EDRAS, we gain significant insights into
how dynamic boundary conditions influence bulk phase evolution and
thermodynamic behavior. The proposed approach offers an effective, physically
informed enhancement to PINN frameworks for solving thermodynamically
consistent models, making PINN a robust and versatile computational tool for
investigating complex thermodynamic processes in arbitrary geometries.

TL;DR: A framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is introduced to solve nonlinear lattice challenges, including solution approximation, bifurcation diagrams, and stability analysis, showing high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges in nonlinear lattices, such as solution approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis, using scalable and efficient neural network tools.

Method: Uses PINNs with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solution approximation, stochastic sampling for efficiency, continuation for bifurcation diagrams, and adapted PINNs for stability analysis with output constraints.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable or superior to traditional methods, especially in high-dimensional settings, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Neural networks, particularly PINNs, are effective and scalable tools for studying complex nonlinear lattice systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for addressing key challenges in nonlinear lattices, including solution
approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis.
We first employ PINNs to approximate solutions of nonlinear systems arising
from lattice models, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize
network weights for greater accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency in
high-dimensional settings, we integrate a stochastic sampling strategy. We then
extend the method by coupling PINNs with a continuation approach to compute
snaking bifurcation diagrams, incorporating an auxiliary equation to
effectively track successive solution branches. For linear stability analysis,
we adapt PINNs to compute eigenvectors, introducing output constraints to
enforce positivity, in line with Sturm-Liouville theory. Numerical experiments
are conducted on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation with cubic and quintic
nonlinearities in one to five spatial dimensions. The results demonstrate that
the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to, or better than,
traditional numerical methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where
computational resources are a limiting factor. These findings highlight the
potential of neural networks as scalable and efficient tools for the study of
complex nonlinear lattice systems.

Result: Developed a 1.7-billion parameter model, designed a highly improved AmeR variant, and enabled scalable performance gains.

Conclusion: AMix-1 advances protein engineering, offering a framework for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.

Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian
Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing
pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning
mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we
establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of
structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong

alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into
a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among
MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent
proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically
improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild
type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1
with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed
evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification
budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation
lab-in-the-loop protein design.

Method: Integration of defeasible conditionals, necessity, and possibility notions into standpoint logic, with preferential semantics and a tableaux calculus.

Result: The framework supports defeasible reasoning, with a sound and complete tableaux calculus and PSpace complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed logic successfully extends standpoint logic with defeasibility, offering a robust and computationally feasible framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new defeasible version of propositional

and Varzinczak's notions of defeasible necessity and distinct possibility,
along with Leisegang et al.'s approach to defeasibility into the standpoint
logics of G\'omez \'Alvarez and Rudolph. The resulting logical framework allows
for the expression of defeasibility on the level of implications, standpoint
modal operators, and standpoint-sharpening statements. We provide a
preferential semantics for this extended language and propose a tableaux
calculus, which is shown to be sound and complete with respect to preferential
entailment. We also establish the computational complexity of the tableaux
procedure to be in PSpace.

Motivation: Address privacy risks in AI-managed archives while ensuring data sovereignty and ethical accountability.

Method: Introduces Clio-X, a decentralized Web3 solution embedding PETs, evaluated via a medium-fidelity prototype and analyzed using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory.

Result: User evaluation shows interest in Clio-X but identifies barriers like trust, opacity, economic concerns, and governance.

Conclusion: Proposes participatory design and decentralized governance (Clio-X DAO) for ethical AI deployment in archives, integrating technical and community safeguards.

Abstract: As archives turn to artificial intelligence to manage growing volumes of
digital records, privacy risks inherent in current AI data practices raise
critical concerns about data sovereignty and ethical accountability. This paper
explores how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and Web3 architectures can
support archives to preserve control over sensitive content while still being
able to make it available for access by researchers. We present Clio-X, a
decentralized, privacy-first Web3 digital solution designed to embed PETs into
archival workflows and support AI-enabled reference and access. Drawing on a
user evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype, the study reveals both interest
in the potential of the solution and significant barriers to adoption related
to trust, system opacity, economic concerns, and governance. Using Rogers'
Diffusion of Innovation theory, we analyze the sociotechnical dimensions of
these barriers and propose a path forward centered on participatory design and
decentralized governance through a Clio-X Decentralized Autonomous
Organization. By integrating technical safeguards with community-based
oversight, Clio-X offers a novel model to ethically deploy AI in cultural
heritage contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy leakage and inequity in existing solutions for vehicular traffic management, the paper aims to protect sensitive geographical data while maintaining utility and fairness.

Method: The algorithm integrates differential privacy (Laplace mechanism) with query-based data access, iterative shuffling, and calibrated noise injection to secure data.

Result: Implemented on Norwegian vehicular data, the algorithm maintains utility for traffic management and ensures fair representation of all regions, demonstrated via a heatmap.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully balances privacy, utility, and fairness, offering a robust solution for location-based vehicular traffic management.

Abstract: Location-based vehicular traffic management faces significant challenges in
protecting sensitive geographical data while maintaining utility for traffic
management and fairness across regions. Existing state-of-the-art solutions
often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and
demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis.
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges
regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based
vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing
reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all
regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making.
Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by
integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated
noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected.
We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing
the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based
data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for
traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all
geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented.
Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model,
illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions
across various cities. Our algorithm provides privacy in vehicular traffic

TL;DR: HomeLLaMA is an on-device assistant using a small language model (SLM) for privacy-preserving smart home interactions, with optional remote support via PrivShield.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in LLM-based smart home assistants by avoiding data transmission to remote servers.

Method: Develop HomeLLaMA, a local SLM trained from cloud LLMs, and PrivShield for optional remote queries.

Result: HomeLLaMA provides personalized services while enhancing privacy, validated by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: HomeLLaMA balances privacy and service quality, offering a viable solution for smart home interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable generalizability in
language comprehension and hold significant potential to revolutionize
human-computer interaction in smart homes. Existing LLM-based smart home
assistants typically transmit user commands, along with user profiles and home
configurations, to remote servers to obtain personalized services. However,
users are increasingly concerned about the potential privacy leaks to the
remote servers. To address this issue, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device
assistant for privacy-preserving and personalized smart home serving with a
tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to
deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once
deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating
local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user experience while
protecting their privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional
privacy-preserving LLM-based smart home serving for those users, who are
unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to
remote servers. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive benchmark DevFinder to
assess the service quality. Extensive experiments and user studies (M=100)
demonstrate that HomeLLaMA can provide personalized services while
significantly enhancing user privacy.

*Tianzhe Zhao,Jiaoyan Chen,Yanchi Ru,Haiping Zhu,Nan Hu,Jun Liu,Qika Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates security risks in KG-RAG systems through data poisoning attacks, proposing a stealthy attack strategy that effectively degrades performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KG-RAG systems are vulnerable to data poisoning due to their structured nature, but prior studies overlooked this, focusing only on unstructured data sources.

Method: The study introduces a practical attack setting, identifies adversarial targets, and inserts perturbation triples to mislead KG-RAG inference.

Result: The attack strategy significantly degrades KG-RAG performance with minimal perturbations, validated on benchmarks and four KG-RAG methods.

Conclusion: KG-RAG systems are susceptible to data poisoning, highlighting the need for robust defenses and further research into adversarial knowledge risks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external data to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge
issues. Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources
and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been
increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG)
methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent
studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where
malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the
system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies
focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources,
leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that
KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature.
In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security
issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we
introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world
implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial
target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading
inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods
retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive
experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack
strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance,
even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to
understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and
to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.

Result: Effectively reduces noise and identifies high-priority threats, enabling proactive security responses.

Conclusion: The framework transforms unstructured forum data into structured, actionable intelligence, addressing key challenges in automated threat detection.

Abstract: Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging
cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their
unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper
presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and
prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach
leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to
group related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying
incidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on
predefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that
prioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,
source credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental
evaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method
effectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security
analysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum
discussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses
fundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis.

*Weichen Yu,Ravi Mangal,Terry Zhuo,Matt Fredrikson,Corina S. Pasareanu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs encode internal representations of code vulnerabilities, enabling a new steering technique (MoC) to improve code security and functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' proficiency in code generation, they struggle with detecting or avoiding vulnerabilities. This study explores whether this is due to insufficient learning or ineffective prompting.

Method: The study uses representation engineering to analyze LLMs' internal representations of vulnerabilities and develops MoC, a technique to steer token-generation probabilities.

Result: LLMs encode precise vulnerability representations, outperforming standard prompting. MoC improves security by 8.9% and functionality by 2.1% in Qwen2.5-Coder-7B.

Conclusion: LLMs inherently understand code vulnerabilities; MoC effectively enhances security and functionality in generated code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at sophisticated
code-generation tasks, yet remain ineffective at reliably detecting or avoiding
code vulnerabilities. Does this deficiency stem from insufficient learning
about code vulnerabilities, or is it merely a result of ineffective prompting?
Using representation engineering techniques, we investigate whether LLMs
internally encode the concepts necessary to identify code vulnerabilities. We
find that current LLMs encode precise internal representations that distinguish
vulnerable from secure code--achieving greater accuracy than standard prompting
approaches. Leveraging these vulnerability-sensitive representations, we
develop an inference-time steering technique that subtly modulates the model's
token-generation probabilities through a mixture of corrections (MoC). Our
method effectively guides LLMs to produce less vulnerable code without
compromising functionality, demonstrating a practical approach to controlled
vulnerability management in generated code. Notably, MoC enhances the security
ratio of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B by 8.9\%, while simultaneously improving
functionality on HumanEval pass@1 by 2.1\%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel ML approach using Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is proposed to enhance privacy in UAV-based face detection, balancing security and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in UAV-based face detection due to extensive surveillance capabilities and dynamic environmental challenges.

Method: Integrates HE (specifically the CKKS scheme) with neural networks, using SIMD data encoding and secure inference on encrypted data.

Result: Achieves less than 1% accuracy loss compared to non-encrypted benchmarks while ensuring data privacy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy protection and detection performance, making it viable for secure UAV face detection.

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a novel machine learning (ML) approach
incorporating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to address privacy limitations in
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based face detection. Due to challenges related
to distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and
sophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic
environments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance
capabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that
integrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout
the inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with
minimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system
leverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly
on encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security.
Furthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed
to preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a
Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a
secure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption.
This approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial
data but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy
protection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based
secure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data
confidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than
1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically require fine-tuning for
domain-specific tasks, and LoRA offers a computationally efficient approach by
training low-rank adapters. LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated
LLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without
sharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local
adapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying
differential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise
to both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one
adapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose
FedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double
Sketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of
both low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized
SVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first
aggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then
reconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating
of both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy
guarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a
variety of privacy settings and data distributions.

*Xiaojie Lin,Baihe Ma,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Ying He,Wei Ni,Ren Ping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CAN-Trace is a new privacy attack using CAN messages to reconstruct driving trajectories, achieving high success rates in urban and suburban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting driving trajectories are vulnerable to GPS outages, leaving privacy at risk.

Method: CAN-Trace transforms CAN messages (speed, accelerator pedal) into weighted graphs and uses graph-matching against road networks.

Result: Achieves 90.59% success in urban and 99.41% in suburban regions.

Conclusion: CAN-Trace poses a significant privacy threat, highlighting the need for stronger protections against such attacks.

Abstract: Driving trajectory data remains vulnerable to privacy breaches despite
existing mitigation measures. Traditional methods for detecting driving
trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning
System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper
introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages
Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing
a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory
reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages,
specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs
accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving
trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in
comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched
candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies.
Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing
different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace:
it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and
99.41% in the suburban region.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach is proposed to detect DNS tunneling, overcoming limitations of traditional rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNS tunneling hides harmful actions in seemingly normal traffic, and traditional detection methods are often inadequate.

Method: Machine learning algorithms analyze DNS traffic features to detect tunneling.

Result: The proposed approach shows promise for accurate DNS tunneling detection.

Conclusion: Machine learning is effective for identifying DNS tunneling, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Detecting Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling is a significant challenge in
security due to its capacity to hide harmful actions within DNS traffic that
appears to be normal and legitimate. Traditional detection methods are based on
rule-based approaches or signature matching methods that are often insufficient
to accurately identify such covert communication channels. This research is
about effectively detecting DNS tunneling. We propose a novel approach to
detect DNS tunneling with machine learning algorithms. We combine machine
learning algorithms to analyze the traffic by using features extracted from DNS
traffic. Analyses results show that the proposed approach is a good candidate
to detect DNS tunneling accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack comprehensive financial analysis capabilities, leading to the need for a collaborative multi-agent system.

Method: FinTeam employs four specialized LLM agents (document analyzer, analyst, accountant, consultant) trained on financial datasets.

Result: FinTeam achieves a 62% acceptance rate in human evaluations and improves accuracy on FinCUGE (7.43%) and FinEval (2.06%).

Conclusion: FinTeam demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration in complex financial tasks, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: Financial report generation tasks range from macro- to micro-economics
analysis, also requiring extensive data analysis. Existing LLM models are
usually fine-tuned on simple QA tasks and cannot comprehensively analyze real
financial scenarios. Given the complexity, financial companies often distribute

multi-agent collaborative system, with a workflow with four LLM agents:
document analyzer, analyst, accountant, and consultant. We train these agents
with specific financial expertise using constructed datasets. We evaluate
FinTeam on comprehensive financial tasks constructed from real online
investment forums, including macroeconomic, industry, and company analysis. The
human evaluation shows that by combining agents, the financial reports generate
from FinTeam achieved a 62.00% acceptance rate, outperforming baseline models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate physical knowledge into machine learning models, leveraging PDEs and improving understanding of PIML behavior.

Method: Analyzes PINNs for approximation, consistency, and convergence; frames PIML as kernel methods; develops GPU-efficient algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates PIML's effectiveness in energy signal forecasting and introduces a physics-constrained framework for time series.

Conclusion: PIML enhances machine learning by embedding physical laws, with practical applications in forecasting and time series analysis.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is an emerging framework that
integrates physical knowledge into machine learning models. This physical prior
often takes the form of a partial differential equation (PDE) system that the
regression function must satisfy. In the first part of this dissertation, we
analyze the statistical properties of PIML methods. In particular, we study the
properties of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in terms of
approximation, consistency, overfitting, and convergence. We then show how PIML
problems can be framed as kernel methods, making it possible to apply the tools
of kernel ridge regression to better understand their behavior. In addition, we
use this kernel formulation to develop novel physics-informed algorithms and
implement them efficiently on GPUs. The second part explores industrial
applications in forecasting energy signals during atypical periods. We present
results from the Smarter Mobility challenge on electric vehicle charging
occupancy and examine the impact of mobility on electricity demand. Finally, we
introduce a physics-constrained framework for designing and enforcing
constraints in time series, applying it to load forecasting and tourism
forecasting in various countries.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper surveys Bayesian continual learning, exploring its definitions, settings, and connections to related fields, while categorizing algorithms and discussing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning mimics human learning by accumulating knowledge sequentially without forgetting past experiences, offering potential to enhance deep models for real-world applications.

Method: The survey examines Bayesian continual learning settings (task-incremental and class-incremental), categorizes algorithms, and analyzes state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The paper provides a taxonomy of Bayesian continual learning algorithms, highlights prominent methods, and draws analogies to developmental psychology.

Conclusion: Challenges in Bayesian continual learning are discussed, with suggestions for future research to advance the field.

Abstract: Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually
accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time
steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge
without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and
while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature
and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an
opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of
widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world
problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving
sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and
Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the
prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the
knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings
of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and
class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual
learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related
fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning.
Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of
algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we
analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent
Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light
on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and
correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a
discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for
future research on Bayesian continual learning.

*Joseph Lazzaro,Ciara Pike-Burke*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fixed-confidence piecewise constant bandit problem to identify abrupt changes in piecewise constant functions efficiently. It provides lower bounds for change point identification and proposes an asymptotically optimal method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Piecewise constant functions are common in real-world applications, and identifying their abrupt changes quickly is crucial. The paper aims to address this need with a bandit problem framework.

Method: The authors introduce a fixed-confidence piecewise constant bandit problem, where noisy evaluations are queried sequentially. They derive lower bounds for change point identification and propose a Track-and-Stop variant.

Result: The proposed method is shown to be asymptotically optimal, with sampling focused near change points and inversely proportional to the change magnitude. Experimental results validate its efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper presents a theoretically grounded and practical method for identifying change points in piecewise constant functions, supported by both analysis and experiments.

Abstract: Piecewise constant functions describe a variety of real-world phenomena in
domains ranging from chemistry to manufacturing. In practice, it is often
required to confidently identify the locations of the abrupt changes in these
functions as quickly as possible. For this, we introduce a fixed-confidence
piecewise constant bandit problem. Here, we sequentially query points in the
domain and receive noisy evaluations of the function under bandit feedback. We
provide instance-dependent lower bounds for the complexity of change point
identification in this problem. These lower bounds illustrate that an optimal
method should focus its sampling efforts adjacent to each of the change points,
and the number of samples around each change point should be inversely
proportional to the magnitude of the change. Building on this, we devise a
simple and computationally efficient variant of Track-and-Stop and prove that
it is asymptotically optimal in many regimes. We support our theoretical
findings with experimental results in synthetic environments demonstrating the
efficiency of our method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study convergence in high-probability of SGD-type methods in non-convex
optimization and the presence of heavy-tailed noise. To combat the heavy-tailed
noise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming
nonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth
counterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the
rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments
and a symmetric probability density function (PDF). Crucially, N-SGD has
exponentially decaying tails, matching the performance of linear SGD under
light-tailed noise. To handle non-symmetric noise, we propose two novel
estimators, based on the idea of noise symmetrization. The first, dubbed
Symmetrized Gradient Estimator (SGE), assumes a noiseless gradient at any
reference point is available at the start of training, while the second, dubbed
Mini-batch SGE (MSGE), uses mini-batches to estimate the noiseless gradient.
Combined with the nonlinear framework, we get N-SGE and N-MSGE methods,
respectively, both achieving the same convergence rate and exponentially
decaying tails as N-SGD, while allowing for non-symmetric noise with unbounded
moments and PDF satisfying a mild technical condition, with N-MSGE additionally
requiring bounded noise moment of order $p \in (1,2]$. Compared to works
assuming noise with bounded $p$-th moment, our results: 1) are based on a novel
symmetrization approach; 2) provide a unified framework and relaxed moment
conditions; 3) imply optimal oracle complexity of N-SGD and N-SGE, strictly
better than existing works when $p < 2$, while the complexity of N-MSGE is
close to existing works. Compared to works assuming symmetric noise with
unbounded moments, we: 1) provide a sharper analysis and improved rates; 2)
facilitate state-dependent symmetric noise; 3) extend the strong guarantees to
non-symmetric noise.

*Gianluigi Silvestri,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CoVAE introduces a single-stage generative autoencoding framework using consistency training, eliminating the need for a two-stage process and enabling high-quality sample generation in fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead and increased sampling times of two-stage generative approaches by proposing a unified single-stage framework.

Method: CoVAE trains a VAE with progressive latent representations and a time-dependent β parameter, using a consistency loss with variational regularization.

Result: CoVAE outperforms equivalent VAEs and other single-stage methods, generating high-quality samples in one or few steps without a learned prior.

Conclusion: CoVAE provides a viable route for efficient, high-performance autoencoding and bridges autoencoding with diffusion-style generative modeling.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art generative approaches frequently rely on a two-stage
training procedure, where an autoencoder (often a VAE) first performs
dimensionality reduction, followed by training a generative model on the
learned latent space. While effective, this introduces computational overhead
and increased sampling times. We challenge this paradigm by proposing
Consistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage
generative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency
models to train a VAE architecture. The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive
series of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels,
mirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models. This
sequence of representations is regulated by a time dependent $\beta$ parameter
that scales the KL loss. The decoder is trained using a consistency loss with
variational regularization, which reduces to a conventional VAE loss at the
earliest latent time. We show that CoVAE can generate high-quality samples in
one or few steps without the use of a learned prior, significantly
outperforming equivalent VAEs and other single-stage VAEs methods. Our approach
provides a unified framework for autoencoding and diffusion-style generative
modeling and provides a viable route for one-step generative high-performance
autoencoding. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: To understand the generalization capabilities of task-agnostic foundation models in zero-shot prediction settings.

Method: Theoretical analysis of self-supervised and multimodal contrastive learning for pre-training foundation models.

Result: Identifies key conditional independence relationships and target quantities enabling zero-shot prediction.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into the generalization mechanisms of zero-shot prediction in AI.

Abstract: A modern paradigm for generalization in machine learning and AI consists of
pre-training a task-agnostic foundation model, generally obtained using
self-supervised and multimodal contrastive learning. The resulting
representations can be used for prediction on a downstream task for which no
labeled data is available. We present a theoretical framework to better
understand this approach, called zero-shot prediction. We identify the target
quantities that zero-shot prediction aims to learn, or learns in passing, and
the key conditional independence relationships that enable its generalization
ability.

TL;DR: A randomized approximation algorithm for SPCA is introduced, achieving a bounded approximation ratio under certain conditions and demonstrating efficacy on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPCA is NP-hard, and existing methods lack efficient approximation guarantees. This paper aims to provide a scalable and theoretically sound solution.

Method: The algorithm uses SDP relaxation and randomization, with guarantees under low-rank or exponentially decaying eigenvalue conditions.

Result: The algorithm achieves an approximation ratio bounded by the sparsity constant or O(log d), and performs well in numerical tests.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is effective and near-optimal under broad conditions, validated by real-world data.

Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) is a fundamental technique for
dimensionality reduction, and is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce a
randomized approximation algorithm for SPCA, which is based on the basic SDP
relaxation. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio of at most the sparsity
constant with high probability, if called enough times. Under a technical
assumption, which is consistently satisfied in our numerical tests, the average
approximation ratio is also bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\log{d})$, where $d$ is the
number of features. We show that this technical assumption is satisfied if the
SDP solution is low-rank, or has exponentially decaying eigenvalues. We then
present a broad class of instances for which this technical assumption holds.
We also demonstrate that in a covariance model, which generalizes the spiked
Wishart model, our proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal approximation
ratio. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical results
on real-world datasets.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A machine-learning framework is proposed to retrieve bidirectional species associations from community and environmental data, outperforming existing models in detecting symmetric and asymmetric interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biotic interactions shape community assembly, but most models assume symmetric relationships. This work aims to capture both symmetric and asymmetric interactions.

Method: The framework models pairwise species associations as directed influences using latent embeddings and fits them within a multi-species conditional generative model.

Result: The framework successfully recovers known symmetric and asymmetric associations and outperforms existing models like joint species distribution models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is intuitive, modular, and broadly applicable for studying species interactions across taxonomic groups.

Abstract: There is no much doubt that biotic interactions shape community assembly and
ultimately the spatial co-variations between species. There is a hope that the
signal of these biotic interactions can be observed and retrieved by
investigating the spatial associations between species while accounting for the
direct effects of the environment. By definition, biotic interactions can be
both symmetric and asymmetric. Yet, most models that attempt to retrieve
species associations from co-occurrence or co-abundance data internally assume
symmetric relationships between species. Here, we propose and validate a
machine-learning framework able to retrieve bidirectional associations by
analyzing species community and environmental data.
  Our framework (1) models pairwise species associations as directed influences
from a source to a target species, parameterized with two species-specific
latent embeddings: the effect of the source species on the community, and the
response of the target species to the community; and (2) jointly fits these
associations within a multi-species conditional generative model with different
modes of interactions between environmental drivers and biotic associations.
Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the ability of our
framework to recover known asymmetric and symmetric associations and highlight
the properties of the learned association networks. By comparing our approach
to other existing models such as joint species distribution models and
probabilistic graphical models, we show its superior capacity at retrieving
symmetric and asymmetric interactions. The framework is intuitive, modular and
broadly applicable across various taxonomic groups.

*Albert Chiu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: An algorithm for identifying interpretable subgroups with elevated treatment effects using rule sets, balancing subgroup size and effect size, validated through sample splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uninterpretability of high-dimensional CATE estimates by providing clear, actionable subgroups for decision-making.

Method: Uses rule sets to characterize subgroups, optimizes an objective function trading off subgroup size and effect size, and employs sample splitting for valid inference.

Result: Produces a Pareto optimal frontier of rule sets, demonstrating utility in simulated and empirical examples.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap between complex CATE estimates and interpretable, actionable insights.

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for identifying interpretable subgroups with
elevated treatment effects, given an estimate of individual or conditional
average treatment effects (CATE). Subgroups are characterized by ``rule sets''
-- easy-to-understand statements of the form (Condition A AND Condition B) OR
(Condition C) -- which can capture high-order interactions while retaining
interpretability. Our method complements existing approaches for estimating the
CATE, which often produce high dimensional and uninterpretable results, by
summarizing and extracting critical information from fitted models to aid
decision making, policy implementation, and scientific understanding. We
propose an objective function that trades-off subgroup size and effect size,
and varying the hyperparameter that controls this trade-off results in a
``frontier'' of Pareto optimal rule sets, none of which dominates the others
across all criteria. Valid inference is achievable through sample splitting. We
demonstrate the utility and limitations of our method using simulated and
empirical examples.

TL;DR: A method for learning signed graphs from smooth signed graph signals using the net Laplacian as a GSO, solved via ADMM with linear complexity per iteration, and validated on simulated and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph learning focuses on unsigned graphs, but many systems (biological, social) require signed graphs to capture positive and negative interactions.

Method: Uses net Laplacian as GSO, formulates a non-convex optimization problem for total variation minimization, and solves it with ADMM and a fast linear-complexity algorithm.

Result: Theoretical convergence proofs and error bounds are provided. The method outperforms existing signed graph learning methods in simulations and gene regulatory network inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively learns signed graphs from smooth signals, offering theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world data is often represented through the relationships between data
samples, forming a graph structure. In many applications, it is necessary to
learn this graph structure from the observed data. Current graph learning
research has primarily focused on unsigned graphs, which consist only of
positive edges. However, many biological and social systems are better
described by signed graphs that account for both positive and negative
interactions, capturing similarity and dissimilarity between samples. In this
paper, we develop a method for learning signed graphs from a set of smooth
signed graph signals. Specifically, we employ the net Laplacian as a graph
shift operator (GSO) to define smooth signed graph signals as the outputs of a
low-pass signed graph filter defined by the net Laplacian. The signed graph is
then learned by formulating a non-convex optimization problem where the total
variation of the observed signals is minimized with respect to the net
Laplacian. The proposed problem is solved using alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and a fast algorithm reducing the per-ADMM iteration
complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of nodes is introduced.
Furthermore, theoretical proofs of convergence for the algorithm and a bound on
the estimation error of the learned net Laplacian as a function of sample size,
number of nodes, and graph topology are provided. Finally, the proposed method
is evaluated on simulated data and gene regulatory network inference problem
and compared to existing signed graph learning methods.

*Ridwan Olabiyi,Han Hu,Ashif Iquebal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework to model dynamical systems under noisy and variable conditions, outperforming traditional methods like SINDy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods assume fixed-coefficient deterministic models, failing under noisy, variable conditions. SIP addresses this gap.

Method: SIP treats unknown coefficients as random variables, inferring their posterior distribution by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: SIP reduces coefficient error by 82% vs. SINDy, accurately identifying equations and providing interpretable uncertainty.

Conclusion: SIP is a robust, data-efficient method for physics discovery in noisy, variable, and data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: In the study of complex dynamical systems, understanding and accurately
modeling the underlying physical processes is crucial for predicting system
behavior and designing effective interventions. Yet real-world systems exhibit
pronounced input (or system) variability and are observed through noisy,
limited data conditions that confound traditional discovery methods that assume
fixed-coefficient deterministic models. In this work, we theorize that
accounting for system variability together with measurement noise is the key to
consistently discover the governing equations underlying dynamical systems. As
such, we introduce a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework that
treats the unknown coefficients as random variables and infers their posterior
distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
push-forward of the posterior samples and the empirical data distribution.
Benchmarks on four canonical problems -- the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey
system (multi- and single-trajectory), the historical Hudson Bay lynx-hare
data, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and fluid infiltration in porous media
using low- and high-viscosity liquids -- show that SIP consistently identifies
the correct equations and lowers coefficient root-mean-square error by an
average of 82\% relative to the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
(SINDy) approach and its Bayesian variant. The resulting posterior
distributions yield 95\% credible intervals that closely track the observed
trajectories, providing interpretable models with quantified uncertainty. SIP
thus provides a robust, data-efficient approach for consistent physics
discovery in noisy, variable, and data-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared to other algorithms, prompting the need for deeper understanding of its variants.

Method: The study evaluates EI from the maximum of the posterior sample path, proposing a posterior sampling-based random EI.

Result: The proposed method achieves sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under Gaussian process assumptions.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the randomized EI variant.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing an
expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In particular, the effectiveness of
expected improvement (EI) has been demonstrated in a wide range of
applications. However, theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared with
other theoretically established algorithms. This paper analyzes a randomized
variant of EI, which evaluates the EI from the maximum of the posterior sample
path. We show that this posterior sampling-based random EI achieves the
sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under the assumption that the
black-box function follows a Gaussian process. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments.

Method: Developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate biased loan applications, trained classifiers on synthetic datasets, and applied mitigations at various stages (pre-processing, in-processing). Used second-order Shapley values for explainability.

Result: Demonstrated how biased data leads to unfair predictions and introduced a controllable bias injection framework. The explainability technique showed mitigation effects on classifier behavior.

Conclusion: The work provides tools for understanding and mitigating bias in predictive models, with contributions in synthetic data generation and explainability.

Abstract: Predictive models often reinforce biases which were originally embedded in
their training data, through skewed decisions. In such cases, mitigation
methods are critical to ensure that, regardless of the prevailing disparities,
model outcomes are adjusted to be fair. To assess this, datasets could be
systematically generated with specific biases, to train machine learning
classifiers. Then, predictive outcomes could aid in the understanding of this
bias embedding process. Hence, an agent-based model (ABM), depicting a loan
application process that represents various systemic biases across two
demographic groups, was developed to produce synthetic datasets. Then, by
applying classifiers trained on them to predict loan outcomes, we can assess
how biased data leads to unfairness. This highlights a main contribution of
this work: a framework for synthetic dataset generation with controllable bias
injection. We also contribute with a novel explainability technique, which
shows how mitigations affect the way classifiers leverage data features, via
second-order Shapley values. In experiments, both offline and online learning
approaches are employed. Mitigations are applied at different stages of the
modelling pipeline, such as during pre-processing and in-processing.

### [478] [MF-GLaM: A multifidelity stochastic emulator using generalized lambda models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10303)
*K. Giannoukou,X. Zhu,S. Marelli,B. Sudret*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces MF-GLaMs, a method to emulate the conditional response distribution of high-fidelity stochastic simulators using lower-fidelity data, improving accuracy or reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic simulators produce random outputs due to unmodeled variables, making their emulation challenging. Traditional deterministic surrogate models are inadequate, and high-fidelity data can be scarce or expensive.

Method: The proposed MF-GLaMs extend the generalized lambda model (GLaM) to multifidelity settings, using a flexible four-parameter distribution to represent conditional responses without needing multiple replications or internal simulator details.

Result: MF-GLaMs outperform single-fidelity GLaMs in accuracy at the same cost or achieve similar performance at lower costs, demonstrated through synthetic and real-world earthquake examples.

Conclusion: MF-GLaMs offer an efficient, non-intrusive solution for emulating stochastic simulators, leveraging lower-fidelity data to enhance high-fidelity predictions.

Abstract: Stochastic simulators exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to unobservable,
uncontrollable, or unmodeled input variables, resulting in random outputs even
at fixed input conditions. Such simulators are common across various scientific
disciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability
distribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic
surrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately
characterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large
datasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF)
simulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they
can enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling
(MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic
settings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional
response distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to
efficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic
simulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach
builds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the
conditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter
generalized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no
access to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple
replications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM
through synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake
application. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the
same cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly
reduced cost.

### [479] [Information Must Flow: Recursive Bootstrapping for Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10443)
*Xin Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a framework modeling cognition as information flow between high-entropy context and low-entropy content, resolving the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT). It uses variational entropy minimization to stabilize representations and enables hierarchical inference, temporal bootstrapping, and language as a symbolic transport system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify cognitive modeling by addressing the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT) and explain how cognition resolves uncertainty through bidirectional information flow.

Method: CCUP employs Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy minimization for bidirectional inference (bottom-up contextual disambiguation and top-down content reconstruction), hierarchical delta-seeded inference, and temporal/spatial bootstrapping.

Result: The framework stabilizes perceptual schemas and motor plans, refines memory, and enables compositional hierarchical inference. It also explains language as a symbolic transport system for collective intelligence.

Conclusion: CCUP establishes iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in cognition and collective intelligence, with recursive inference as the structured conduit for adaptation and alignment.

Abstract: We present the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a unified
framework that models cognition as the directed flow of information between
high-entropy context and low-entropy content. Inference emerges as a cycle of
bidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with
top-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in
Optimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy
minimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty
while preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins
temporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial
bootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta
Convergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields
delta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor
plans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake
consolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge.
Extending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference:
low-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped
by top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant
manifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we
propose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing
latent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals. Together,
these results establish iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in
both individual cognition and collective intelligence, positioning recursive
inference as the structured conduit through which minds adapt, align, and
extend.

### [480] [History Matching under Uncertainty of Geological Scenarios with Implicit Geological Realism Control with Generative Deep Learning and Graph Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10201)
*Gleb Shishaev,Vasily Demyanov,Daniel Arnold*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: A graph-based variational autoencoder is proposed for handling geological uncertainty, using latent space and Geodesic metrics to ensure geological realism. It outperforms traditional lattice-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in geological scenarios (e.g., depositional or structural) and improve realism in reservoir modeling.

Method: Utilizes a graph-based variational autoencoder with latent space control and Geodesic metrics. Tested on synthetic 3D channelised geological datasets.

Result: Demonstrated viability with synthetic data, showing effective latent space structure via PCA, t-SNE, and TDA.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach is effective for geological modeling, offering better control and realism compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The graph-based variational autoencoder represents an architecture that can
handle the uncertainty of different geological scenarios, such as depositional
or structural, through the concept of a lowerdimensional latent space. The main
difference from recent studies is utilisation of a graph-based approach in
reservoir modelling instead of the more traditional lattice-based deep learning
methods. We provide a solution to implicitly control the geological realism
through the latent variables of a generative model and Geodesic metrics. Our
experiments of AHM with synthetic dataset that consists of 3D realisations of
channelised geological representations with two distinct scenarios with one and
two channels shows the viability of the approach. We offer in-depth analysis of
the latent space using tools such as PCA, t-SNE, and TDA to illustrate its
structure.

*Muhammad Kamran Saeed,Ashfaq Khokhar,Shakil Ahmed*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning framework is proposed for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, addressing scalability and computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-gen wireless tech (e.g., 6G) demands ultra-high data rates and low latency, but XL-MIMO and RIS face CSI estimation challenges due to scalability and computational complexity.

Method: Proposes a patch-based training mechanism leveraging spatial correlations to reduce input dimensionality while preserving essential information.

Result: Simulations show improved estimation accuracy and reduced computational complexity, even with increasing antennas and RIS elements.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and suitable for resource-constrained edge devices, enhancing XL-MIMO and RIS deployment.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding
requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced
connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and
energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control
over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However,
realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information
(CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded
channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of
existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing
number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to
real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume,
escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting
in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation
in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial
correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that
reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while
preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale
systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational
complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in
XL-MIMO systems.

*Abdelhalim Dahou,Ansgar Scherp,Sebastian Kurten,Brigitte Mathiak,Madhu Chauhan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces automated methods for segmenting research R code using LLMs/SLMs, presenting two approaches and a dataset. Context-based line-by-line analysis outperforms range-based segmentation, with fine-tuned smaller models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+) surpassing LLMs despite no prior R code exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual and syntactic code segmentation is impractical for large repositories, especially in low-resource languages like R. Automation is needed for efficient navigation and comprehension.

Method: Two approaches are explored: line-by-line analysis with context and range-based segmentation. Experiments involve LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs, including tests on Python code for generalizability.

Result: Context-based line-by-line analysis is superior. Fine-tuned smaller models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+) outperform LLMs, even without pre-training on R code.

Conclusion: Automated, domain-specific segmentation using fine-tuned smaller models is effective for research R code, offering a scalable solution for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Source code segmentation, dividing code into functionally coherent segments,
is crucial for knowledge retrieval and maintenance in software development.
While enabling efficient navigation and comprehension of large codebases,
manual and syntactic analysis approaches have become impractical as
repositories grow, especially for low-resource languages like R and their
research domains (e.g., social sciences, psychology).This paper introduces an
automated, domain-specific approach for research R code segmentation using
Large and Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs). It presents two novel approaches
and a human-annotated dataset, StatCodeSeg. We explore two distinct approaches:
line-by-line analysis with context and range-based segment determination. We
experiment with LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs. To support the generalizability of
our approaches, we also include experiments on Python code from the computer
science domain.Our results show that context-based line-by-line analysis is
superior over range-based segmentation.Using smaller language models like
CodeBERT and an encoder-only version of CodeT5+ are better than their LLM
counterparts. Most notably, these two best-performing models did not see R code
during pre-training versus the LLMs but were only fine-tuned on 4,130 lines of
manually annotated code.

*Yuheng Huang,Da Song,Zhenlan Ji,Shuai Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: StateGen is an automated framework for generating diverse coding tasks with sequential API interactions, addressing gaps in current LLM tool-use evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM tool use rely on manual test cases and overlook complex API interactions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs, later translated into natural language tasks.

Result: StateGen created StateEval, a benchmark with 120 verified test cases across three scenarios, demonstrating its ability to generate realistic API-oriented tasks.

Conclusion: StateGen effectively highlights LLM weaknesses in API integration, providing a robust framework for future evaluations.

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex
real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use
remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually
collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for
semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string
matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex
interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in
real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen,
an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving
sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API
constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow
injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated
into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of
two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark
encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative
scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental
results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and
realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current
LLMs incorporating APIs.

Conclusion: Tippy offers a new paradigm for AI-assisted drug discovery, demonstrating the transformative potential of AI in laboratory workflows.

Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry faces unprecedented challenges in drug discovery,
with traditional approaches struggling to meet modern therapeutic development
demands. This paper introduces a novel AI framework, Tippy, that transforms
laboratory automation through specialized AI agents operating within the
Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle. Our multi-agent system employs five
specialized agents - Supervisor, Molecule, Lab, Analysis, and Report, with
Safety Guardrail oversight - each designed to excel in specific phases of the

implementation of specialized AI agents for automating the DMTA cycle,
providing a concrete example of how AI can transform laboratory workflows. By
leveraging autonomous AI agents that reason, plan, and collaborate, we
demonstrate how Tippy accelerates DMTA cycles while maintaining scientific
rigor essential for pharmaceutical research. The system shows significant
improvements in workflow efficiency, decision-making speed, and

*Avi Arora,Jinu Jang,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SetupBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability to bootstrap environments from scratch, revealing low success rates and inefficiencies in current agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents focus on pre-configured environments, missing the critical skill of environment setup. SetupBench addresses this gap.

Method: SetupBench includes 93 tasks across seven language ecosystems, five databases, and multi-service scenarios, testing installation, dependency resolution, and configuration.

Result: Evaluation shows low success rates (20.0-57.4%), with failures due to incomplete tooling, hallucinated constraints, and non-persistent changes. Agents also exhibit inefficiency (38-89% unnecessary actions).

Conclusion: SetupBench highlights gaps in LLM agents' environment-bootstrap capabilities, providing a benchmark for improving practical task-solving in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise end to end assistance with
real-world software tasks, yet existing benchmarks evaluate LLM agents almost
exclusively in pre-baked environments where every dependency is pre-installed.
To fill this gap, we introduce SetupBench, a 93 instance benchmark that
isolates the environment-bootstrap skill: starting from a bare Linux sandbox,
an agent must install packages, resolve dependency conflicts, initialize
databases, and configure background services. Our tasks span seven language
ecosystems, five database engines, and multi-service orchestration scenarios,
each accompanies by a natural language problem statement and a deterministic
success command. Through evaluation of OpenHands, a state-of-the-art coding
agent, we find low success rates across task categories, with particular
challenges in repository setup (38.9-57.4%) and local database configuration
(20.0-53.3%). Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes including
incomplete development tooling installation, hallucinated task constraints, and
non-persistent environment modifications that break agent-human collaboration
workflows. We identify substantial inefficiencies in agent exploration
strategies, with 38-89% of actions being unnecessary compared to optimal human
behavior. These findings highlight gaps in current agents' practical
environment-bootstrap capabilities. By targeting this critical yet
under-evaluated capability, SetupBench provides a rigorous yard-stick for the
next generation of software developer agents aiming to solve end to end
real-wold tasks.

Conclusion: SPICE enables cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation and is released alongside SPICE Bench, a new dataset.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often
prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable,

context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass
consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations.
SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling
more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with

instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results
demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset
creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE
tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated
from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench

Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing quantum circuits under NISQ constraints by leveraging DRL and complementary optimization techniques.

Method: Uses a central orchestration engine to coordinate three optimizers: a DRL-based rewriter, a domain-specific optimizer, and a parameterized circuit instantiator.

Result: Produces hardware-aware optimized circuits for transpilation and execution, adapting to backend constraints.

Conclusion: OrQstrator effectively optimizes quantum circuits for NISQ devices by intelligently combining multiple optimization strategies.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach, OrQstrator, which is a modular framework for
conducting quantum circuit optimization in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum

orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit
optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count
via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs
efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized
circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits
during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models (LLMs) to assist in performance-oriented software configuration, evaluating their ability to identify options, rank configurations, and recommend performant setups. Results show potential but also limitations like hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software configuration is complex and requires expertise, while machine learning approaches are computationally expensive. LLMs offer a potential alternative.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on tasks like identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant setups across systems like compilers and video encoders.

Result: LLMs showed alignment with expert knowledge in some cases but exhibited hallucinations or superficial reasoning in others.

Conclusion: The study is a first step toward systematic evaluation and design of LLM-based solutions for software configuration, highlighting both promise and limitations.

Abstract: Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can
affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size,
or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and
requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand,
machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a
high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations
are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language
models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through
prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant
options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations
across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT
solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable
limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert
knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other
cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and
the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.

Motivation: Manually writing formal specifications is tedious and error-prone, and while LLMs can generate them, their large size and high computational demands raise efficiency concerns.

Method: Construct a specialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then fine-tune a 7B-parameter code model to handle real-world dependencies and pre-state information.

Result: The compact model matches or outperforms larger models (e.g., GPT-4o) in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and bug-distinguishing capability on the Defects4J benchmark.

Abstract: Formal specifications are essential for ensuring software correctness, yet
manually writing them is tedious and error-prone. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promise in generating such specifications from natural language
intents, but the giant model size and high computational demands raise a
fundamental question: Do we really need large models for this task? In this
paper, we show that a small, fine-tuned language model can achieve high-quality
postcondition generation with much lower computational costs. We construct a
specialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then
supervise the fine-tuning of a $7$B-parameter code model. Our approach tackles
real-world repository dependencies and preserves pre-state information,
allowing for expressive and accurate specifications. We evaluate the model on a
benchmark of real-world Java bugs (Defects4J) and compare against both
proprietary giants (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source large models. Empirical
results demonstrate that our compact model matches or outperforms significantly
larger counterparts in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and
bug-distinguishing capability. These findings highlight that targeted
fine-tuning on a modest dataset can enable small models to achieve results
formerly seen only in massive, resource-heavy LLMs, offering a practical and
efficient path for the real-world adoption of automated specification
generation.

### [493] [Hybrid Systolic Array Accelerator with Optimized Dataflow for Edge Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09010)
*Chun-Ting Chen,HanGyeol Mun,Jian Meng,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Jae-sun Seo*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Proposes an edge LLM inference accelerator with a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture, optimizing efficiency for both prefill and decode stages, and reducing external memory access (EMA) with MXINT4 quantization. Achieves significant performance and energy efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure, low-latency, and cost-effective edge inference for large language models (LLMs) by addressing the challenges of area efficiency, EMA minimization, and energy efficiency.

Method: Introduces a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture, MXINT4 weight quantization, optimized dataflow, and specialized units for RMSNorm and RoPE to reduce latency, area, and memory access.

Result: Achieves 247/117 token/s/mm² for a 1.3B LLM, with >2.45x/13.5x improvement over existing methods, while maintaining energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed accelerator effectively balances performance, area efficiency, and energy efficiency for edge LLM inference, outperforming current solutions.

Abstract: Edge inference for large language models (LLM) offers secure, low-latency,
and cost-effective inference solutions. We emphasize that an edge accelerator
should achieve high area efficiency and minimize external memory access (EMA)
during the memory-bound decode stage, while maintaining high energy efficiency
during the compute intensive prefill stage. This paper proposes an edge LLM
inference accelerator featuring a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture that
optimizes inference efficiency in both stages. To further reduce EMA, we adopt
MXINT4 weight quantization and propose an optimized dataflow tailored for HSA,
ensuring negligible dequantization overhead and achieving 100% hardware
utilization with minimal accuracy loss under edge DRAM bandwidth constraints.
For non-linear operations, we incorporate optimized root mean square
normalization (RMSNorm) and rotary position embedding (RoPE) units, reducing
their latency, area, and memory access overhead while enabling end-to-end
inference on our accelerator. Our solution achieves 247/117 (token/s/mm2) while
running a 1.3B LLM on long-input/long-output scenarios, providing >2.45x/13.5x
improvement over existing approaches, while maintaining superior energy
efficiency in token generation.

### [494] [BitParticle: Partializing Sparse Dual-Factors to Build Quasi-Synchronizing MAC Arrays for Energy-efficient DNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09780)
*Feilong Qiaoyuan,Jihe Wang,Zhiyu Sun,Linying Wu,Yuanhua Xiao,Danghui Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MAC unit leveraging dual-factor sparsity for DNN acceleration, addressing partial product explosion and variable cycle counts with a quasi-synchronous scheme, improving area and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bit-level sparsity in quantized DNNs offers optimization potential for MAC operations, but existing methods fail to exploit dual-factor sparsity and suffer from poor flexibility in scheduling.

Method: A MAC unit using a particlization-based approach to leverage dual-factor sparsity, with simple control logic to avoid partial product explosion, and a quasi-synchronous scheme for flexible scheduling.

Result: The exact version improves area efficiency by 29.2%, while the approximate variant boosts energy efficiency by 7.5% with minor accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed design effectively addresses challenges in exploiting bit-level sparsity, enhancing MAC unit efficiency for DNN acceleration.

Abstract: Bit-level sparsity in quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) offers
significant potential for optimizing Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations.
However, two key challenges still limit its practical exploitation. First,
conventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity
of both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods
designed to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of
exploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the
fluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC
operations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for
dual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant
underutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study
proposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging
particlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of
partial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more
area- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less
significant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware
simplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second
challenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level
elasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC
unit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the
proposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency
compared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while
maintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further
improves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version. Index-Terms:

### [495] [Pimba: A Processing-in-Memory Acceleration for Post-Transformer Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10178)
*Wonung Kim,Yubin Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jinwoo Hwang,Seongryong Oh,Jiyong Jung,Aziz Huseynov,Woong Gyu Park,Chang Hyun Park,Divya Mahajan,Jongse Park*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pimba, a unified framework for efficient serving of transformer and post-transformer LLMs, addressing scalability challenges with memory bandwidth limitations and hardware costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face scalability issues with long-context inferencing due to compute and memory costs, prompting exploration of post-transformer architectures like SSMs and RNNs. A unified serving system is needed.

Method: Analyzes performance of transformer and post-transformer LLMs, identifies memory bandwidth as a bottleneck, and designs Pimba with State-update Processing Units (SPUs) using MX-based quantized arithmetic.

Result: Pimba achieves up to 3.2x and 2.1x higher token generation throughput compared to LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems.

Conclusion: Pimba effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges for both transformer and post-transformer LLMs, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models
(LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet,
their compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability
challenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community
is exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs),
linear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as
post-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving
system that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs
within a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the
performance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite
their algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory
bandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state
updates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights:
(1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making
per-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision
arithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify
Microsoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we
design Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared
between two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a
State-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers
and adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of
state update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to
LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 3.2x and 2.1x
higher token generation throughput, respectively.

*Prashant Govindarajan,Davide Baldelli,Jay Pathak,Quentin Fournier,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CADmium, a method using large language models (LLMs) to automate CAD design by generating CAD sequences from natural language descriptions, supported by a new dataset and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD modeling is time-intensive and manual, with limited automation efforts. The potential of LLMs for sequential CAD design remains unexplored.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 170k CAD models with GPT-4.1-generated descriptions is created. Code-LLMs are fine-tuned to generate CAD sequences from natural language.

Result: CADmium automates CAD design, significantly speeding up object creation. Novel geometric and topological metrics provide richer evaluation insights.

Conclusion: The approach is viable and effective, with the dataset, code, and models made publicly available.

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Motivation: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models faces issues like energy instabilities and guidance artifacts, degrading visual quality.

Method: The authors analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and introduce energy-aware CFG scheduling strategies to modulate guidance strength dynamically.

Result: Their approach achieves superior stability (0.9998) and consistency (0.9873) scores, with DPM++ 2M and linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yielding optimal performance.

Conclusion: The energy profiling framework improves diffusion model behavior, producing sharper, artifact-free images.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from
energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We
analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive
classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy
trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that
modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores
(0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance
approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling
yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars using patch-based local expressions and 3D Gaussian splatting, achieving photorealistic results in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for photorealistic 3D head avatars in applications like telepresence and movies, especially for close-ups showing detailed facial expressions and microfeatures.

Method: Coupling patch-based local expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting, using a patch-based geometric 3D face model and Scaffold-GS for dynamic synthesis.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with natural motion, diverse expressions, and real-time rendering.

Conclusion: Patch-level expressions combined with 3D Gaussian splatting enable ultra-high fidelity and photorealistic avatars.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

TL;DR: A novel framework combining statistical and machine learning methods identifies predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets, yielding a 15.38% return in backtesting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the identification and exploitation of predictive relationships between equities for profitable trading opportunities.

Method: Combines Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, Granger Causality Test (GCT), PCMCI test, Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and KNN classifier for lag optimization.

Result: The strategy achieved a 15.38% return, outperforming Buy-and-Hold (10.39%), with high Sharpe Ratio (2.17) and win rates.

Conclusion: Provides a robust methodology for volatility-based trading, benefiting both academic research and practical algorithmic trading.

Abstract: Purpose: This study introduces a novel framework for identifying and
exploiting predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets. We propose
an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with
machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of
predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range
historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting
clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating
the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary
Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to
identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the
optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously
backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested
from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The
portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the
10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics,
including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain
pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research
contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable
trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The
findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial
modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a
structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.

*Mohammad Abolnejadian,Shakiba Amirshahi,Matthew Brehmer,Anamaria Crisan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A system for real-time decision-making in expert conversations (e.g., doctor-patient) retrieves insights from past data using a retrieval-based LLM, showing promise but facing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experts in real-time decision-making lack access to historical data during conversations, prompting the need for a system to leverage past insights dynamically.

Method: Implemented a conversational interface with a retrieval-based LLM pipeline to listen, identify problems/solutions, and fetch relevant data from embedded datasets (e.g., Health Canada).

Result: Simulated studies demonstrated effectiveness but highlighted challenges, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: The system shows potential for aiding real-time decisions but requires further development to address identified challenges.

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and
make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive
historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it
infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information.
This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant
past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data?
To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking
doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously
listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested
solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating
concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language
Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada
datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample
doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting
directions for the next steps of our work.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework to enhance programming-by-prompting by decomposing synthesis into task-aligned representations, improving control and interpretability for non-programmers like educators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of programming affordances (traceability, refinement, testing) in generative AI-driven programming-by-prompting, especially for non-programmers like educators.

Method: Proposes the CoA framework, decomposing synthesis into intermediate abstractions (e.g., Concept Graph, Scenario Graph) and implements it in SimStep, an authoring tool with an inverse correction process.

Result: CoA improves authoring control and interpretability, as shown in evaluations with educators.

Conclusion: CoA successfully bridges the gap between natural language flexibility and programming affordances in programming-by-prompting workflows.

Abstract: Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for
end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic
intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as
educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate
interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of
programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and
behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA)
framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive
flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a
sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function
as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate
this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds
simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph,
Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address
ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process
that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without
requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA
enables greater authoring control and interpretability in
programming-by-prompting workflows.

Motivation: The lack of transparency in AI systems hinders trust and adoption, especially in critical areas like healthcare. VA offers a solution by combining AI with visual tools to bridge the gap between human expertise and machine processes.

Method: The authors define and categorize VA solutions, propose a design space for visualizations, and showcase developed VA dashboards for tasks like data processing, model refinement, and debugging.

Result: VA dashboards support various stages of the AI pipeline, enabling users to interactively refine and understand models, thereby fostering trust.

Conclusion: Visual analytics is a promising approach to enhance transparency and trust in AI systems, particularly in high-stakes applications like healthcare.

Abstract: Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex
problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch
to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients. With the
iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds
significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous
deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion
annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of
transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing
predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder
experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA)
provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive
visualizations. These specialized charts and graphs empower users to
incorporate their domain expertise to refine and improve the models, bridging
the gap between AI and human understanding. In this work, we define,
categorize, and explore how VA solutions can foster trust across the stages of
a typical AI pipeline. We propose a design space for innovative visualizations
and present an overview of our previously developed VA dashboards, which
support critical tasks within the various pipeline stages, including data
processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, understanding,
debugging, refining, and comparing models.

Motivation: To assess the realism, usability, and performance of AI-powered NPCs in VR, using advanced language models like GPT-4 Turbo.

Method: A VR simulator with two AI NPCs (suspect and partner) was tested with 18 participants. Metrics included SUS, GEQ, believability questionnaires, and latency measurements for STT, TTS, and GPT-4 Turbo.

Result: Average cycle latency was 7 seconds; believability scored 6.67/10, with high marks in behavior but moderate in emotion. SUS score was 79.44, indicating good usability.

Conclusion: Large language models enhance NPC realism in VR, but latency and emotional depth need improvement for more immersive experiences.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the
realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality

evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their
perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features
two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage
participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A
user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability
Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent
Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text
(STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency.
Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the
increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with
high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate
scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44,
indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large
language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting
challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This
research contributes to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven NPCs,
revealing the need for performance optimization to achieve increasingly
immersive virtual experiences.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to not only detect anomalies in complex systems using ML but also find the optimal control strategy to restore the system with minimal disruption, applied to an offshore wind turbine transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beyond anomaly detection, the goal is to identify minimal adjustments to restore systems to safe states, addressing a gap in counterfactual optimization for complex systems.

Method: Framed as a counterfactual problem, the approach uses a mathematical model to find optimal solutions while respecting system constraints, focusing on energy systems.

Result: Tests on real-world data show adaptability to user preferences and annual savings of ~3 million euros in a typical wind farm.

Conclusion: The work advances counterfactual optimization in a new domain (energy systems) and opens broader research avenues.

Abstract: Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults
and anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step
further: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal
control strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal
disruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a
Machine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or
anomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's
control variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to
the good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds
the optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific
constraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on
individual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a
decision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis.
Our work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing
counterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind
turbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual
optimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in
this area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show
that our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in
the order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.

TL;DR: A novel MPC-RL-MOBO framework integrates MPC-based RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for efficient, safe, and high-performance control learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MPC-RL methods face slow convergence, suboptimal policy learning, and safety issues during adaptation.

Method: Combines MPC-RL with MOBO using CDPG for gradient estimation and EHVI for parameter tuning.

Result: Demonstrates sample-efficient, stable, and high-performance learning in control systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses MPC-RL limitations, improving performance and safety.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a
structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL
methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However,
standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal
policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during
online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The
proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its
gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG)
approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables
efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop
performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient,
stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, scalable, and effective for large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural stochastic optimization method for efficiently
solving the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problem under
high-dimensional uncertainty scenarios. The proposed method approximates the
second-stage recourse problem using a deep neural network trained to map
commitment decisions and uncertainty features to recourse costs. The trained
network is subsequently embedded into the first-stage UC problem as a
mixed-integer linear program (MILP), allowing for explicit enforcement of
operational constraints while preserving the key uncertainty characteristics. A
scenario-embedding network is employed to enable dimensionality reduction and
feature aggregation across arbitrary scenario sets, serving as a data-driven
scenario reduction mechanism. Numerical experiments on IEEE 5-bus, 30-bus, and
118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed neural two-stage stochastic
optimization method achieves solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%,
while enabling orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to conventional MILP
solvers and decomposition-based methods. Moreover, the model's size remains
constant regardless of the number of scenarios, offering significant
scalability for large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems.

### [507] [Symptom-Driven Personalized Proton Pump Inhibitors Therapy Using Bayesian Neural Networks and Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09685)
*Yutong Li,Ilya Kolmanovsky*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A noninvasive, symptom-based framework using Bayesian Neural Networks and Model Predictive Control reduces PPI consumption by 65% while maintaining effective acid suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic high-dose PPI use poses risks, and current invasive monitoring is impractical. A noninvasive, personalized approach is needed.

Method: Bayesian Neural Network predicts symptoms from historical data, feeding a chance-constrained MPC algorithm to dynamically adjust PPI doses.

Result: In silico studies show 65% reduction in PPI use with 95% probability of acid suppression.

Conclusion: The framework enables personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without invasive monitoring.

Abstract: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for gastric acid
disorders but carry significant risks when administered chronically at high
doses. Precise long-term control of gastric acidity is challenged by the
impracticality of invasive gastric acid monitoring beyond 72 hours and wide
inter-patient variability. We propose a noninvasive, symptom-based framework
that tailors PPI dosing solely on patient-reported reflux and digestive symptom
patterns. A Bayesian Neural Network prediction model learns to predict patient
symptoms and quantifies its uncertainty from historical symptom scores, meal,
and PPIs intake data. These probabilistic forecasts feed a chance-constrained
Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that dynamically computes future PPI
doses to minimize drug usage while enforcing acid suppression with high
confidence - without any direct acid measurement. In silico studies over
diverse dietary schedules and virtual patient profiles demonstrate that our
learning-augmented MPC reduces total PPI consumption by 65 percent compared to
standard fixed regimens, while maintaining acid suppression with at least 95
percent probability. The proposed approach offers a practical path to
personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without
invasive sensors.

*Enhao Zhang,Erkang Zhu,Gagan Bansal,Adam Fourney,Hussein Mozannar,Jack Gerrits*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: M1-Parallel framework reduces latency in LLM-based multi-agent systems by running multiple teams in parallel, improving speed or task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in iterative multi-agent systems for complex tasks motivates the need for parallel execution to uncover diverse solution paths.

Method: Proposes M1-Parallel, using parallel multi-agent teams with event-driven communication and asynchronous messaging to explore distinct plans.

Result: Achieves 2.2× speedup with early termination and higher task completion rates with aggregation, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Parallel execution optimizes multi-agent systems for complex tasks, though diversity strategies showed no extra gains.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated
remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into
subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite
their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world
problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To
address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently
runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths.
By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging,
M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to
either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our
experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination
achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that
M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further
investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe
no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings
underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent
systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

*Andrew Estornell,Jean-Francois Ton,Muhammad Faaiz Taufiq,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A hierarchical multi-agent framework (MLPO) trains a single leader LLM to coordinate untrained peers, improving performance and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning tasks by leveraging multiple LLMs while reducing computational costs of training and inference.

Method: Introduces MLPO, training a leader LLM to evaluate and synthesize responses from untrained peer agents without extra networks or feedback.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains on BBH, MATH, and MMLU benchmarks over single-agent and multi-agent baselines.

Conclusion: Training a single leader LLM is effective and efficient for collaborative reasoning in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on a wide range
of complex reasoning tasks, yet further gains are often possible by leveraging
the complementary strengths of multiple models. While multi-agent frameworks
can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are
often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this
work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these
challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of
untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy
\textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to
evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or
explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance
not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy
improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team.
Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our
framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent
and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in
multi-agent LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS tools lack fine-grained persona specifications and integrated validation, limiting their utility for behavioral studies and social simulations.

Method: Introduces TinyTroupe, enabling detailed persona definitions and programmatic control via LLM-driven mechanisms, with examples like brainstorming and market research.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations highlight possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs, demonstrating TinyTroupe's effectiveness.

Conclusion: TinyTroupe is a novel conceptual contribution, available as open source, and adaptable to other contexts.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of
autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered
Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation
purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its
distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS
libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population
sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among
other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social
simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this
work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona
definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs,
behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This
allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical
interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means
for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative
working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby
simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided,
highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though
realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual
contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pressing societal challenges like pandemics and climate adaptation by understanding collective behavior of autonomous agents.

Method: LPMs use computational methods for large-scale simulations, mathematical frameworks for data learning, and privacy-preserving protocols.

Result: Enables observation of system-level outcomes and testing interventions before real-world implementation.

Conclusion: LPMs complement AI research by focusing on collective intelligence and providing policy testing grounds.

Abstract: Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply
chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of
millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population
Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by
simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at
unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three
key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of
agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse
real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that
bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe
how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions
before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on
creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs
develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent
phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics,
LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective
intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations
before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some
open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework

Conclusion: The THOR Module provides a scalable, secure solution for non-technical users to access live data with simplicity and safety.

Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval)
Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that
transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics
for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled
orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema
Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation
Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail.
An integrated Self-Correction & Rating loop captures empty results, execution
errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration
attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise,
human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight & Intelligence engine
for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate
reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema
awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module
empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and
enterprise-grade safety.

TL;DR: Tracer is a new VDBMS for Re-ID queries, improving accuracy and recall with adaptive processing and long-term correlation modeling, outperforming Spatula by 3.9x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatula's limitations in accuracy and recall for large camera networks and critical applications drive the need for a better system.

Method: Tracer uses a recurrent network for long-term correlation modeling and a probabilistic adaptive search model for high recall.

Result: Tracer outperforms Spatula by 3.9x on average across datasets.

Conclusion: Tracer addresses Spatula's shortcomings and provides a scalable, efficient solution for Re-ID queries.

Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras
is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the
state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID
queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal
filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized
camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications
that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query
processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing
Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the
optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to
model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high
recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model
that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically
updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy.
To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy
concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera
Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows
that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by
3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: HedraRAG effectively improves resource utilization and reduces latency in RAG serving.

Abstract: This paper addresses emerging system-level challenges in heterogeneous

workflows and diverse request patterns complicate efficient execution. We
present HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that
exposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism,
intra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are
realized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting,
reordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of
subgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are
mapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce
latency. Evaluations across a wide range of RAG workflows demonstrate speedups
exceeding 1.5x and reaching up to 5x over existing frameworks, showcasing the
effectiveness of coordinated generation and retrieval in serving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the expected distance to an optimal point by improving stepsize adaptation in stochastic approximation.

Method: Uses online estimates of the second moment of search directions per block coordinate, leveraging a conditional estimator for efficiency.

Result: Derives a new method with comparable performance to Adam but lower memory and hyper-parameter requirements; proves convergence to a small neighborhood of the optimal point.

Conclusion: The method is broadly applicable, not requiring convexity or smoothness, and its convergence depends on estimator bias and variance.

Abstract: We consider stochastic approximation with block-coordinate stepsizes and
propose adaptive stepsize rules that aim to minimize the expected distance from
the next iterate to an optimal point. These stepsize rules employ online
estimates of the second moment of the search direction along each block
coordinate. The popular Adam algorithm can be interpreted as a particular
heuristic for such estimation. By leveraging a simple conditional estimator, we
derive a new method that obtains comparable performance as Adam but requires
less memory and fewer hyper-parameters. We prove that this family of methods
converges almost surely to a small neighborhood of the optimal point, and the
radius of the neighborhood depends on the bias and variance of the
second-moment estimator. Our analysis relies on a simple aiming condition that
assumes neither convexity nor smoothness, thus has broad applicability.

TL;DR: The paper explores policy gradient (PG) methods for solving the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator problem, addressing limitations in theoretical guarantees by using an alternative parameterization of stabilizing controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of PG methods in the LQG setting is limited due to the lack of gradient dominance in classical parameterizations. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors adopt a history representation of control input, parameterized by past input and output data, to establish gradient dominance and approximate smoothness for the LQG cost.

Result: Global convergence and per-iteration stability guarantees for PG LQG are proven in both model-based and model-free settings, supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed parameterization enables robust theoretical guarantees for PG methods in the LQG problem, demonstrating global convergence and stability.

Abstract: We consider solutions to the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator
problem via policy gradient (PG) methods. Although PG methods have demonstrated
strong theoretical guarantees in solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
problem, despite its nonconvex landscape, their theoretical understanding in
the LQG setting remains limited. Notably, the LQG problem lacks gradient
dominance in the classical parameterization, i.e., with a dynamic controller,
which hinders global convergence guarantees. In this work, we study PG for the
LQG problem by adopting an alternative parameterization of the set of
stabilizing controllers and employing a lifting argument. We refer to this
parameterization as a history representation of the control input as it is
parameterized by past input and output data from the previous p time-steps.
This representation enables us to establish gradient dominance and approximate
smoothness for the LQG cost. We prove global convergence and per-iteration
stability guarantees for policy gradient LQG in model-based and model-free
settings. Numerical experiments on an open-loop unstable system are provided to
support the global convergence guarantees and to illustrate convergence under
different history lengths of the history representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel programs are important but difficult to solve, especially under time constraints, motivating the need for efficient approximators.

Method: The framework leverages modern techniques for differentiation through optimization problems to train neural networks as approximators.

Result: The method is demonstrated on synthetic bilevel programs and control system co-design problems, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: Neural networks can be trained to efficiently approximate solutions for parametric bilevel optimization problems.

Abstract: Learning to Optimize (L2O) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) in which ML
models are trained to solve parametric optimization problems. The general goal
is to learn a fast approximator of solutions to constrained optimization
problems, as a function of their defining parameters. Prior L2O methods focus
almost entirely on single-level programs, in contrast to the bilevel programs,
whose constraints are themselves expressed in terms of optimization
subproblems. Bilevel programs have numerous important use cases but are
notoriously difficult to solve, particularly under stringent time demands. This
paper proposes a framework for learning to solve a broad class of challenging
bilevel optimization problems, by leveraging modern techniques for
differentiation through optimization problems. The framework is illustrated on
an array of synthetic bilevel programs, as well as challenging control system
co-design problems, showing how neural networks can be trained as efficient
approximators of parametric bilevel optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAAL with Nesterov acceleration, achieving the optimal convergence rate of O(1/k²) for Lipschitz-smooth functions without requiring hyperparameter tuning or line searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing adaptive gradient methods, which cannot match the optimal convergence rate of accelerated gradient descent.

Method: Develops GRAAL with Nesterov acceleration, proving it achieves O(1/k²) convergence for Lipschitz-smooth functions, even with arbitrary initial stepsizes.

Result: The proposed algorithm attains the optimal convergence rate with a logarithmic additive term in iteration complexity.

Conclusion: The study successfully accelerates adaptive gradient methods to match Nesterov's optimal rate, enhancing their practical utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of minimizing a continuously
differentiable convex objective function $\min_x f(x)$. Recently, several
adaptive gradient methods, including GRAAL (Malitsky, 2020), have been
developed. These methods estimate the local curvature of the objective function
to compute stepsizes, attain the standard convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$
of fixed-stepsize gradient descent for Lipschitz-smooth functions, and do not
require any line search procedures or hyperparameter tuning. However, a natural
question arises: is it possible to accelerate the convergence of these
algorithms to match the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ of the accelerated
gradient descent of Nesterov (1983)? Although some attempts have been made (Li
and Lan, 2023), the capabilities of the existing accelerated algorithms to
adapt to the curvature of the objective function are highly limited.
Consequently, we provide a positive answer to this question and develop GRAAL
with Nesterov acceleration. We prove that our algorithm achieves the desired
optimal convergence rate for Lipschitz smooth functions. Moreover, in contrast
to existing methods, it does so with an arbitrary, even excessively small,
initial stepsize at the cost of a logarithmic additive term in the iteration
complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraud detection is critical for financial systems, especially for companies like Flow Payment, to balance security and user experience.

Method: Incorporates Relative Distance Rotating Encoding (ReDRE) into the RoFormer model to better capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Improved fraud detection by enhancing the characterization of time series data.

Conclusion: The ReDRE-enhanced RoFormer model offers a promising approach for advancing fraud detection in transactional systems.

Abstract: Fraud detection is one of the most important challenges that financial
systems must address. Detecting fraudulent transactions is critical for payment
gateway companies like Flow Payment, which process millions of transactions
monthly and require robust security measures to mitigate financial risks.
Increasing transaction authorization rates while reducing fraud is essential
for providing a good user experience and building a sustainable business. For
this reason, discovering novel and improved methods to detect fraud requires
continuous research and investment for any company that wants to succeed in
this industry. In this work, we introduced a novel method for detecting
transactional fraud by incorporating the Relative Distance Rotating Encoding
(ReDRE) in the RoFormer model. The incorporation of angle rotation using ReDRE
enhances the characterization of time series data within a Transformer, leading
to improved fraud detection by better capturing temporal dependencies and event

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a
finite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $r$
monotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements
$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq N$
such that $f_i(S) \ge b_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$. When $r=1$ this is the
well-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work
\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and
developed bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms
for the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.
These are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting
problems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at
least $\Omega(\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In
this paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when
$r$ is a \emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering
multiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria
approximation algorithm that for any given integer $\alpha \ge 1$ outputs a set
$S$ such that $f_i(S) \ge$ $(1-1/e^\alpha -\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \in [r]$
and $\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \le (1+\epsilon)\alpha \cdot \sf{OPT}$. Second, when the
$f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we
obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$ $(\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\beta)$-approximation where
$\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via
the natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an
approximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention
some applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate
more in the future.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm's performance, revealing a phase transition at density γ=1/2, with tight bounds on iterations and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the algorithm's strong empirical performance and establish tight bounds on its iteration count.

Method: Analyzes normalized matrices with density γ, proving upper and lower bounds on iterations and runtime.

Result: For γ>1/2, the algorithm runs in O(log n - log ε) iterations and Õ(n²) time. For γ<1/2, it requires Ω(n¹/²/ε) iterations.

Conclusion: A sharp phase transition occurs at γ=1/2, explaining the algorithm's empirical efficiency and theoretical limits.

Abstract: The matrix scaling problem, particularly the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, has
been studied for over 60 years. In practice, the algorithm often yields
high-quality approximations within just a few iterations. Theoretically,
however, the best-known upper bound places it in the class of
pseudopolynomial-time approximation algorithms. Meanwhile, the lower-bound
landscape remains largely unexplored. Two fundamental questions persist: what
accounts for the algorithm's strong empirical performance, and can a tight
bound on its iteration count be established?
  For an $n\times n$ matrix, its normalized version is obtained by dividing
each entry by its largest entry. We say that a normalized matrix has a density
$\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\rho > 0$ such that one row or column has
exactly $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ entries with values at least $\rho$, and every
other row and column has at least $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ such entries.
  For the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a
nearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\log n - \log \varepsilon)$ iterations
and $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose
normalized version has a density $\gamma > 1/2$. Such matrices cover both the
algorithm's principal practical inputs and its typical theoretical regime, and
the $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ runtime is optimal.
  For the lower bound, we establish a tight bound of
$\widetilde{\Omega}\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations for positive
matrices under the $\ell_2$-norm error measure. Moreover, for every $\gamma <
1/2$, there exists a matrix with density $\gamma$ for which the algorithm
requires $\Omega\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations.
  In summary, our results reveal a sharp phase transition in the Sinkhorn-Knopp
algorithm at the density threshold $\gamma = 1/2$.

### [523] [Less Stress, More Privacy: Stress Detection on Anonymized Speech of Air Traffic Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08882)
*Janaki Viswanathan,Alexander Blatt,Konrad Hagemann,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates architectures for stress detection in anonymized ATC voice data, achieving high accuracy (93.6% and 80.1%) while complying with privacy laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress detection in ATC is crucial for safety, but privacy laws like GDPR restrict voice data usage. Anonymization is proposed to address this.

Method: Different architectures for stress detection are evaluated using anonymized ATC voice data, including a modified SUSAS dataset and an ATC simulation dataset.

Result: The best models achieved 93.6% accuracy on anonymized SUSAS and 80.1% on anonymized ATC simulation data.

Conclusion: Privacy-compliant anonymization does not hinder high-performance deep-learning models for stress detection in ATC.

Abstract: Air traffic control (ATC) demands multi-tasking under time pressure with high
consequences of an error. This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key
point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC
voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with
these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection
for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress
detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under
Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our
anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be
an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.

### [524] [Voice Conversion for Lombard Speaking Style with Implicit and Explicit Acoustic Feature Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09310)
*Dominika Woszczyk,Manuel Sam Ribeiro,Thomas Merritt,Daniel Korzekwa*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores Lombard speaking style transfer using voice conversion (VC) to improve TTS systems, comparing implicit and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. Implicit conditioning matches explicit in intelligibility while preserving speaker similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lombard TTS systems enhance speech intelligibility for hearing loss and noisy environments, but data collection is challenging. VC offers a solution by transferring the Lombard style without extensive recordings.

Method: The study compares VC models with implicit and explicit acoustic feature conditioning for Lombard style transfer, aiming to retain speaker identity while adopting the Lombard style.

Result: Implicit conditioning achieves comparable intelligibility gains to explicit conditioning and better preserves speaker similarity.

Conclusion: Implicit conditioning is a viable alternative to explicit methods for Lombard style transfer, balancing intelligibility and speaker preservation.

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in Lombard speaking style can improve the
overall intelligibility of speech, useful for hearing loss and noisy
conditions. However, training those models requires a large amount of data and
the Lombard effect is challenging to record due to speaker and noise
variability and tiring recording conditions. Voice conversion (VC) has been
shown to be a useful augmentation technique to train TTS systems in the absence
of recorded data from the target speaker in the target speaking style. In this
paper, we are concerned with Lombard speaking style transfer. Our goal is to
convert speaker identity while preserving the acoustic attributes that define
the Lombard speaking style. We compare voice conversion models with implicit
and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. We observe that our proposed
implicit conditioning strategy achieves an intelligibility gain comparable to
the model conditioned on explicit acoustic features, while also preserving
speaker similarity.

*Tomasz Sroka,Tomasz Wężowicz,Dominik Sidorczuk,Mateusz Modrzejewski*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of deepfake music detection models under audio augmentations, finding significant performance drops even with minor transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative audio models improve, distinguishing real from synthetic music becomes harder, necessitating robust detection systems.

Method: A dataset of real and synthetic music was created, and audio augmentations were applied to test a state-of-the-art detection model's generalization.

Result: The model's classification accuracy dropped significantly with even light audio augmentations.

Conclusion: Current deepfake music detection models lack robustness to audio transformations, highlighting a need for more resilient systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative audio models, distinguishing between
human-composed and generated music is becoming increasingly challenging. As a
response, models for detecting fake music have been proposed. In this work, we
explore the robustness of such systems under audio augmentations. To evaluate
model generalization, we constructed a dataset consisting of both real and
synthetic music generated using several systems. We then apply a range of audio
transformations and analyze how they affect classification accuracy. We test
the performance of a recent state-of-the-art musical deepfake detection model
in the presence of audio augmentations. The performance of the model decreases
significantly even with the introduction of light augmentations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study evaluates four strategies to enhance synthetic RIR datasets for monoaural SE, finding MB-RIRs with frequency-dependent absorption coefficients perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the ecological validity of synthetic RIR datasets for better SE performance.

Method: Implemented multiband absorption, source/receiver directivity, and mesh-based RIRs; trained DeepFilternet3 models for evaluation.

Result: MB-RIRs achieved +0.51dB SDR and +8.9 MUSHRA score on real RIRs.

Conclusion: MB-RIRs with frequency-dependent absorption coefficients are most effective; dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of four strategies for improving the ecological
validity of synthetic room impulse response (RIR) datasets for monoaural Speech
Enhancement (SE). We implement three features on top of the traditional image
source method-based (ISM) shoebox RIRs: multiband absorption coefficients,
source directivity and receiver directivity. We additionally consider
mesh-based RIRs from the SoundSpaces dataset. We then train a DeepFilternet3
model for each RIR dataset and evaluate the performance on a test set of real
RIRs both objectively and subjectively. We find that RIRs which use
frequency-dependent acoustic absorption coefficients (MB-RIRs) can obtain
+0.51dB of SDR and a +8.9 MUSHRA score when evaluated on real RIRs. The MB-RIRs
dataset is publicly available for free download.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AudioMAE++ improves masked autoencoder performance for audio tasks with enhanced transformer blocks and scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAE approaches for audio use outdated transformer blocks, missing newer architectural advancements.

Method: Proposes AudioMAE++ with macaron-style transformer blocks and gated linear units, pretrained on AudioSet.

Result: Outperforms existing MAE methods on 10 downstream tasks and scales well with more parameters.

Conclusion: AudioMAE++ is a superior self-supervised audio representation model with strong performance and scalability.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) trained on audio spectrogram patches have emerged
as a prominent approach for learning self-supervised audio representations.
While several recent papers have evaluated key aspects of training MAEs on
audio data, the majority of these approaches still leverage vanilla transformer
building blocks, whereas the transformer community has seen steady integration
of newer architectural advancements. In this work, we propose AudioMAE++, a
revamped audio masked autoencoder with two such enhancements, namely
macaron-style transformer blocks with gated linear units. When pretrained on
the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AudioMAE++ models outperform existing MAE
based approaches on 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating excellent
performance on audio classification and speech-based benchmarks. The proposed
AudioMAE++ models also demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics,
outperforming directly comparable standard MAE baselines with up to 4x more
parameters.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WildFX introduces a Docker-based pipeline for generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with professional DSP workflows, enabling AI research to replicate nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI struggles to model professional DSP workflows accurately, especially in replicating nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions in audio effect graphs.

Method: WildFX uses a Docker container with a professional DAW backend to integrate commercial plugins (VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP), supporting complex structures like sidechains and crossovers.

Result: The pipeline successfully estimates mixing graphs and plugin/gain parameters, bridging AI research with practical DSP needs.

Conclusion: WildFX provides a practical solution for AI-driven modeling of professional DSP workflows, with code available for further research.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling
of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging.
In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of
audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based
approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter
interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin
approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance
relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational
constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for
generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered
by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports
seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the
wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g.,
sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A
minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration.
Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of
mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research
with practical DSP demands. The code is available on:

*Peican Zhu,Yubo Jing,Le Cheng,Keke Tang,Yangming Guo*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes KEN, a Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network, to improve multimodal fake news detection by leveraging LVLM for semantic understanding and addressing emotional differences in news.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of misinformation on social media and the limitations of existing methods in understanding image semantics and handling emotional news types motivate the need for a better detection approach.

Method: KEN uses LVLM for semantic understanding of images (via captions) and text (via retrieved evidence), and employs balanced learning to model emotional differences in news.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show KEN's superiority in detecting fake news.

Conclusion: KEN effectively addresses gaps in multimodal fake news detection by combining knowledge augmentation and emotion-guided learning.

Abstract: In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has
made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus.
However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of
images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual
information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without
tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we
propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On
the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding
and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a
comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the
retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and
limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class
differences between different emotional types of news through balanced
learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional
types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.

*Huilai Li,Yonghao Dang,Ying Xing,Yiming Wang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESG-Net, a method for dense audio-visual event localization, addressing semantic gaps and event correlations through multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers and ignore event correlations, limiting performance in complex scenarios.

Method: ESG-Net uses an early semantics interaction (ESI) module for hierarchical semantic understanding and a mixture of dependency experts (MoDE) module for adaptive event dependency extraction.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while reducing computational load.

Conclusion: ESG-Net effectively bridges modality gaps and models event dependencies, improving localization accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event
categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies
only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking
cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality
semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between
event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely
consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer
concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate
multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which
respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events
and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on
event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network
(ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of
dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to
explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through
multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring
hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the
extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of
experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly
reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on
https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel U-Net variation improves thoracic vertebrae segmentation in X-ray images, achieving a 4.1% Dice score boost over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual vertebral contouring in spinal mobility disease is laborious and error-prone; automation can enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposed a 'sandwich' U-Net structure with dual activation functions for vertebrae segmentation in X-ray images.

Result: 4.1% improvement in Dice score compared to baseline U-Net, ensuring reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Conclusion: The automated method offers a more accurate and efficient alternative to manual vertebral contouring for mobility disease analysis.

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring
vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring
variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring
plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is
traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular,
mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra,
which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods
provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification,
segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time
consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to
accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray
images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with
dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared
to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring
reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) to create high-quality synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs), achieving realistic results validated by expert evaluation and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of public medical datasets for AI research and education by generating realistic synthetic dental images.

Method: Uses PanoDiff for low-resolution PR generation and a transformer-based SR model to enhance resolution, focusing on local-global relationships for sharper outputs.

Result: Achieved Frechet inception distance of 40.69 and inception scores close to real images. Experts could only distinguish synthetic from real images with 68.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-quality synthetic dental PRs, validated by metrics and expert evaluation, addressing dataset scarcity.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality,
realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can
mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research,
and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a
combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR)
for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former
generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then
processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X
512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global
relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results
demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and
synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for
real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a
diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100
synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy
in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding
to random guessing).

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention for effective multimodal fusion in Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis, achieving 94.88% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to utilize complementary multimodal data effectively, leading to information loss during fusion.

Method: Proposes an asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism to fuse PET, MRI, genetic, and clinical data.

Result: Achieves 94.88% accuracy in distinguishing AD, MCI, and CN.

Conclusion: The asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism significantly improves diagnostic accuracy by better capturing inter-modal interactions.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease
characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the
research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional
convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to
effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and
the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key
information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the
development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for
solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical
professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as
brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the
presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).
The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal
cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information
features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper
compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the
traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning
models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric
cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy
of 94.88% on the test set.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An explainable AI model was developed to detect acute heart failure (AHF) in chest CT scans, achieving accuracy comparable to radiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports for AHF are often delayed due to radiologist shortages, and AI can enhance diagnostic precision.

Method: A Boosted Trees model was trained on segmented cardiac and pulmonary structures from CT scans, using Shapley values for explainability.

Result: The model achieved an AUC of 0.87, with some misclassifications attributed to errors in radiology reports.

Conclusion: The AI model provides transparent, accurate predictions, supporting clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where
acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation
remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a
radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency
physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop
an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an
accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen
University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees
model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and
pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for
training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were
segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used
to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated
twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the
independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications
found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false
negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating
from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory
performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise,
transparent predictions may support decision-making.

*Hanene F. Z. Brachemi Meftah,Wassim Hamidouche,Sid Ahmed Fezza,Olivier Déforges*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method to protect privacy in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by selectively concealing sensitive regions in images, maintaining global semantics while reducing detection of targeted areas by up to 98%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of VLMs raises privacy concerns, as they may inadvertently process or expose private visual information. This work aims to address these concerns by framing privacy preservation as an adversarial attack problem.

Method: The authors introduce a strategy that selectively masks designated Region Of Interests (ROIs) in images, preventing VLMs from accessing sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the rest of the image. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks, this method avoids disrupting the entire image.

Result: Experiments on three VLMs (LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, BLIP2-T5) show up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, with high similarity scores between clean and adversarial outputs confirming preserved global semantics.

Conclusion: The work contributes to privacy-conscious use of multimodal models and provides a practical tool for further research, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These
models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread
adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious
concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process
or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation
of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack
strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of
Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing
sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining
image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire
image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental
results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and
BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while
maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity
scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work
contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a
practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances distortion and perceptual quality, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin
dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that
explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional
approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the
perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic
sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises
three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded
Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction
sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

*Mehmet Onurcan Kaya,Figen S. Oktem*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel phase retrieval method using an image-to-image diffusion framework (Inversion by Direct Iteration) improves initialization and reconstruction quality, outperforming classical and modern techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval is critical in fields like imaging and microscopy, but existing methods are sensitive to initialization and noise. Diffusion models offer promising solutions.

Method: Combines hybrid iterative techniques (Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction) with an acceleration mechanism for robust initialization, then refines using a learned image-to-image pipeline.

Result: Achieves better training efficiency and reconstruction quality, with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and efficient for phase retrieval, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only
measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical
computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several
well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers,
the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and
measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained
traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant
theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a
novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework
called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced
initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the
Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel
acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively
refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline.
Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation
techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared
to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential
for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetv2) for classifying bone fractures in X-ray images under varying noise conditions, aiming to address healthcare disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how noise in X-ray images affects fracture detection and assess the generalizability of pre-trained models in real-world healthcare settings.

Method: Tested three pre-trained models (ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetv2) on progressively degraded X-ray images with noise to simulate real-world challenges.

Result: The study provides insights into the robustness and performance changes of pre-trained models under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a framework for assessing AI model degradation and highlights practical implications for using pre-trained models in diverse healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for
different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper
investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying
bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity
through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested
under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and
EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared.
These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were
progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies
how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained
models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of
the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges
experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper
establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using
transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide
practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep
learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

*Shengjie Liu,Lu Zhang,Siqin Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A physics-guided deep learning framework integrates coarse Earth system model data and high-resolution satellite observations to reconstruct high spatiotemporal temperature data, addressing the trade-off between resolution and frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in temperature data limits real-world applications, with current technology offering either high temporal or spatial resolution but not both.

Method: A convolutional neural network incorporates the annual temperature cycle and a linear term to refine coarse Earth system model outputs using high-resolution satellite data (GOES-16 and Landsat).

Result: The framework successfully reconstructs temperature data, validated with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.

Conclusion: This approach enables high-resolution temperature data generation across scales, under all weather conditions, globally.

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world
applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology
allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at
100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer
continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution
(9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for
temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The
proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the
annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth
system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from
satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16
(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective
temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.
This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for
generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,
under all weather conditions and globally.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated
with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung
cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical
need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of
832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed
using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to
128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50,
VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based
classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics
included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.
U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:

non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For
classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid
CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent
F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed
existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones
provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung
cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

*Sejin Park,Sangmin Lee,Kyong Hwan Jin,Seung-Won Jung*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IM-LUT, a lightweight framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) that blends interpolation functions efficiently using LUTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASISR methods are computationally expensive, and LUT-based approaches lack flexibility for arbitrary scales.

Method: Proposes IM-LUT, which learns to mix interpolation functions via IM-Net and replaces costly operations with LUTs for efficiency.

Result: IM-LUT achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: IM-LUT is a promising solution for resource-constrained ASISR applications.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at
enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table
(LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and
performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale
factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing
ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with
considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these
limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework
that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to
maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a
network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on
local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of
interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are
employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight
and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT
consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency
compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising
solution for resource-constrained applications.

### [544] [A Brain Tumor Segmentation Method Based on CLIP and 3D U-Net with Cross-Modal Semantic Guidance and Multi-Level Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09966)
*Mingda Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-level fusion architecture for brain tumor segmentation in MRI, combining pixel, feature, and semantic-level information, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely heavily on visual MRI features and neglect semantic knowledge from medical reports, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Method: A fusion architecture integrates CLIP models and 3D U-Net via 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal guidance, and semantic-based attention.

Result: The model achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8567 (4.8% better than 3D U-Net) and 7.3% improvement in enhancing tumor region.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages semantic knowledge for more accurate brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

TL;DR: EdgeIMLocSys integrates human feedback for adaptive brain tumor segmentation, using GMLN-BTS for efficient, high-accuracy results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability in MRI scanner quality challenges model generalization, requiring adaptive solutions.

Method: Proposes GMLN-BTS with M2AE, G2MCIM, and VRUM for efficient feature extraction and boundary accuracy.

Result: Achieves 85.1% Dice score on BraTS2017 with 98% fewer parameters than 3D Transformers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates high-accuracy, resource-efficient segmentation for clinical use.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI
scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address
this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in
resource-constrained clinical environments.

*Louise Largeau,Erwan Koch,David Leutwyler,Gregoire Mariethoz,Valerie Chavez-Demoulin,Tom Beucler*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to super-resolve parameters of extreme precipitation distributions directly, using vector generalized models, and introduces a 'robustness gap' to assess model generalization under climate change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The coarse resolution of climate models limits their use for projecting extreme precipitation, and current downscaling methods struggle with robustness under distributional shifts like climate change.

Method: The study uses vector generalized linear and additive models to super-resolve parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution from coarse precipitation fields and topography.

Result: The method demonstrates the ability to super-resolve extreme precipitation distributions and identifies an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on spatial correlations.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable and provides a diagnostic tool for understanding when empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.

Abstract: The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general
circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant
variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the
conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles,
complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional shifts, such as
those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve
robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's
probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within
a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector
generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized
extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse
precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness
gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and
future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the
generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By
evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on
the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of
precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive
value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric
distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and
why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.

TL;DR: CARMANIA introduces a self-supervised pretraining framework for nucleotide sequence analysis, combining next-token prediction with a transition-matrix loss to capture long-range dependencies and improve performance across genomic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-attention mechanisms in transformers are inefficient for long sequences and fail to enforce global transition consistency, limiting their ability to capture higher-order dependencies in nucleotide sequences.

Method: CARMANIA augments next-token prediction with a transition-matrix loss, aligning predicted transitions with empirical n-gram statistics to learn organism-specific sequence structures.

Result: CARMANIA outperforms previous models by at least 7% on long sequences, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences, and shows significant gains in tasks like enhancer prediction (up to 34% MCC improvement).

Conclusion: The transition-matrix loss in CARMANIA effectively captures long-range dependencies and improves accuracy across diverse genomic tasks, particularly where local motifs or regulatory patterns are critical.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing
long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that
autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on
fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard
self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences
due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global
transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian
Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised
pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a
transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions
with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence,
encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local
context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence
structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional
organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory
element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference,
antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster
classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at
least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior
results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster),
and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene
classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts
accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory
patterns drive prediction.

Conclusion: AirScape advances spatial imagination capabilities for embodied intelligence in 3D space.

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied
intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we
present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom
aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current
visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for
aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention
pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase

spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion
intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is essential for 3D map reconstruction, but conventional methods rely on overlapping fields of view or manual annotations.

Method: Proposes a unified optimization framework integrating LiDAR bundle adjustment (LBA) and iterative refinement, constructing a reference point cloud map via continuous scanning and sliding-window LBA.

Result: Achieves 5 mm translational and 0.2° rotational errors, tolerating initial errors up to 0.4 m/30°, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method is robust, accurate, and infrastructure-free, with open-source code available for practical use.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving human-level dexterity in robotic hands by overcoming limitations in computational sensorimotor learning through structured exploration and reinforcement learning, including visuo-tactile human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human dexterity is complex and evolved over millions of years; replicating it in robots is a critical milestone for general embodied intelligence. Current methods face fundamental limitations in computational sensorimotor learning.

Method: Develops reinforcement learning methods with structured exploration and sampling-based planning, and introduces imitation learning techniques using visuo-tactile human demonstrations.

Result: Proposes an effective framework for learning dexterous multi-fingered manipulation skills, overcoming limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The methods advance robotic dexterity by addressing root causes of limitations in sensorimotor learning, paving the way for higher levels of dexterous intelligence.

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

### [552] [On the Importance of Neural Membrane Potential Leakage for LIDAR-based Robot Obstacle Avoidance using Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09538)
*Zainab Ali,Lujayn Al-Amir,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores SNNs for robot navigation using LIDAR, highlighting membrane leakage tuning for precision and releasing an open-source dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs offer low-complexity inference, ideal for resource-limited robotics like drones and rovers.

Method: A custom robot with LIDAR collects labeled data; SNN precision is studied with tuned membrane leakage in LIF neurons.

Result: Tuned SNNs match non-spiking CNN precision in obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Membrane leakage tuning is crucial for SNN precision; the LIDAR dataset is shared to aid future research.

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that

*Gabriel G. Gattaux,Julien R. Serres,Franck Ruffier,Antoine Wystrach*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A biomimetic visual homing system inspired by ants, using a lateralized Mushroom Body architecture, is implemented on a compact robot, achieving robust homing with minimal sensory input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ants' efficient visual homing with minimal learning inspires resource-efficient autonomous navigation solutions.

Method: A lateralized MB architecture categorizes views into memory banks using angular path integration, tested in simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The system achieves robust homing in natural outdoor settings, mimicking ants' behavior with low computational resources.

Conclusion: The biologically grounded approach offers an efficient, scalable solution for autonomous visual homing.

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

*Zhongzhang Chen,Miao Fan,Shengtong Xu,Mengmeng Yang,Kun Jiang,Xiangzeng Liu,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel camera-LiDAR fusion framework using roadside units (IRUs) improves HD semantic mapping, supported by the RS-seq dataset, outperforming unimodal methods by 4-18% in mIoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vehicle-based methods struggle with occlusions and limited perspectives for HD semantic mapping of intersections.

Method: A two-stage fusion framework integrates camera and LiDAR data, leveraging modality-specific features and cross-modal semantic integration.

Result: The multimodal approach improves mIoU by 4% over image-only and 18% over LiDAR-only methods.

Conclusion: The study provides a baseline for IRU-based HD mapping and a valuable dataset for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

*Vindula Jayawardana,Sirui Li,Yashar Farid,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MRMEL, a framework for Lagrangian traffic control in AVs, improving performance across diverse scenarios by dynamically selecting and augmenting nominal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of designing AV traffic control policies that generalize across diverse, real-world traffic scenarios due to multi-agent complexity and conflicting objectives.

Method: MRMEL augments suboptimal nominal policies with learned residuals and dynamically selects the best policy from a pool, modeled as a mixture of experts.

Result: MRMEL achieves a 4%-9% reduction in vehicle emissions compared to baselines in real-world traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: MRMEL effectively addresses the challenges of Lagrangian traffic control, demonstrating robust performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

*Cesar Alan Contreras,Manolis Chiou,Alireza Rastegarpanah,Michal Szulik,Rustam Stolkin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDER is a probabilistic framework for robots to estimate human intent in navigation and manipulation tasks, improving stability and prediction speed compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable seamless human-robot collaboration by accurately inferring human intent without predefined goals or conflicts.

Method: Uses a dual-phase probabilistic framework: Navigation phase blends controller velocity with occupancy grids, and Manipulation phase combines saliency detection and grasp-feasibility tests with real-time updates.

Result: Achieved 93-100% stability in navigation (39.5% improvement in redirection) and 94-100% in manipulation (31.4% improvement). Recognized intent 3x faster in constrained tasks.

Conclusion: GUIDER validates the dual-phase approach, enhancing intent inference for mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SC-ADAS integrates Generative AI for real-time, adaptive driver assistance through natural language dialogue, enabling scene-aware and multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADAS lack natural language interaction and context interpretation, limiting flexibility in dynamic environments.

Method: SC-ADAS combines large language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling for modular ADAS control.

Result: The system supports multi-turn dialogue and executes confirmed intents as ADAS commands, though with trade-offs like latency and token growth.

Conclusion: SC-ADAS shows feasibility in merging conversational reasoning, scene perception, and ADAS control for next-gen driver assistance.

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

TL;DR: Octopi-1.5 is a visual-tactile-language model enhancing tactile signal processing and introducing retrieval-augmented generation for improved task performance and on-the-fly learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Touch is crucial for robots in dexterous manipulation, material identification, and visually occluded scenarios.

Method: Octopi-1.5 processes tactile signals from multiple object parts and uses a RAG module. It is demonstrated via a handheld tactile-enabled interface (TMI).

Result: The model performs tactile inference tasks, identifies objects, and responds to handling queries. It also learns new items on-the-fly.

Conclusion: The demonstration showcases Octopi-1.5's capabilities and limitations, aiming to advance interest in visual-tactile-language models.

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper
are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi-1.5.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tactile-VLA integrates vision, language, action, and tactile sensing to enhance robotic physical interactions, achieving zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robotic agents require precise grounding in physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained force control is essential.

Method: Introduces Tactile-VLA, a framework combining vision, language, action, and tactile sensing with a hybrid position-force controller and reasoning module.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in tactile-aware instruction following, tactile-relevant commonsense use, and adaptive tactile-involved reasoning.

Conclusion: VLM's prior knowledge, when connected to tactile sensors, enables zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks with minimal demonstrations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

*Jie Pan,Tianyi Wang,Yangyang Wang,Junfeng Jiao,Christian Claudel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework for AVs to improve cooperation with HVs by dynamically evaluating trust levels and optimizing social compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVs need socially compatible behaviors and effective cooperation with HVs, but existing frameworks ignore dynamic trust levels, limiting accurate behavior prediction.

Method: Develops a multi-vehicle coalition game with real-time trust evaluations, an online trust evaluation method, and social compatibility objectives.

Result: AVs adjust strategies based on HV trust levels, improving efficiency, safety, and transparency in interactions.

Conclusion: The TGLD framework enhances AV-HV cooperation by integrating trust-awareness and social compatibility, validated in a highway merging scenario.

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RMRP and RPATR for efficient, perception-aware navigation in complex environments, addressing computational and sensor challenges for UAVs and UGVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in autonomous navigation for UAVs and UGVs include computational burdens, sensor occlusions, and irregular terrain traversal, compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies.

Method: RMRP constructs a lightweight linear parametric map using high-dimensional mapping and sparse random projection, backed by a Residual Energy Preservation Theorem. RPATR unifies grid and ESDF maps for UAVs and provides terrain characterization for UGVs, enabling safe, efficient navigation.

Result: The framework shows superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, enabling efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods address key challenges in autonomous navigation, offering theoretical guarantees and practical benefits, with code release for community collaboration.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates diffusion models and potential fields for robust motion planning in pursuit-evasion tasks.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning
framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential
fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our
approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling
efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The
framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local
potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic
scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model
and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial
pursuer observability.

TL;DR: An inverse modeling approach using Neural ODEs is proposed to regulate external sources in tokamaks for achieving controlled burning plasma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise regulation of external particle and energy sources is needed to maintain target core densities and temperatures in tokamaks.

Method: Uses a multinodal plasma dynamics model (NeuralPlasmaODE) with Neural ODEs to compute external source profiles (e.g., NBI power) for desired plasma behavior.

Result: The framework transforms forward simulation into a control-oriented model, enabling computation of external source profiles.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical method for controlling fusion devices by optimizing external sources.

Abstract: Achieving controlled burning plasma in tokamaks requires precise regulation
of external particle and energy sources to reach and maintain target core
densities and temperatures. This work presents an inverse modeling approach
using a multinodal plasma dynamics model based on neural ordinary differential
equations (Neural ODEs). Given a desired time evolution of nodal quantities
such as deuteron density or electron temperature, we compute the external
source profiles, such as neutral beam injection (NBI) power, that drive the
plasma toward the specified behavior. The approach is implemented within the
NeuralPlasmaODE framework, which models multi-region, multi-timescale transport
and incorporates physical mechanisms including radiation, auxiliary heating,
and internodal energy exchange. By formulating the control task as an
optimization problem, we use automatic differentiation through the Neural ODE
solver to minimize the discrepancy between simulated and target trajectories.
This framework transforms the forward simulation tool into a control-oriented
model and provides a practical method for computing external source profiles in
both current and future fusion devices.

Conclusion: NeuralPlasmaODE is useful for predictive modeling and scenario optimization in burning plasma environments.

Abstract: Understanding how key physical parameters influence burning plasma behavior
is critical for the reliable operation of ITER. In this work, we extend
NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region, multi-timescale model based on neural ordinary

radiation mechanisms in ITER plasmas. Normalized sensitivities of core and edge
temperatures and densities are computed with respect to transport
diffusivities, electron cyclotron radiation (ECR) parameters, impurity
fractions, and ion orbit loss (IOL) timescales. The analysis focuses on
perturbations around a trained nominal model for the ITER inductive scenario.
Results highlight the dominant influence of magnetic field strength, safety
factor, and impurity content on energy confinement, while also revealing how
temperature-dependent transport contributes to self-regulating behavior. These
findings demonstrate the utility of NeuralPlasmaODE for predictive modeling and
scenario optimization in burning plasma environments.

TL;DR: ZipVoice-Dialog is a non-autoregressive model for spoken dialogue generation, addressing slow inference and instability in existing models. It introduces speaker-turn embeddings, curriculum learning, and stereo dialogue strategies, and releases a 6.8k-hour dataset (OpenDialog).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spoken dialogue generation models are slow and unstable due to autoregressive methods. The need for realistic turn-taking and distinct speaker timbres drives the development of a better solution.

Method: ZipVoice-Dialog uses flow matching, speaker-turn embeddings, curriculum learning for alignment, and stereo dialogue strategies. It also curates the OpenDialog dataset.

Result: The model outperforms others in intelligibility, turn-taking accuracy, speaker similarity, and speed.

Conclusion: ZipVoice-Dialog offers a robust solution for spoken dialogue generation, supported by a new dataset and benchmark.

Abstract: Generating spoken dialogue is more challenging than monologue text-to-speech
(TTS) due to the need for realistic turn-taking and distinct speaker timbres.
Existing spoken dialogue generation models, being auto-regressive, suffer from
slow and unstable inference. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
ZipVoice-Dialog, a non-autoregressive zero-shot spoken dialogue generation
model built upon flow matching. Key designs include: 1) speaker-turn embeddings
for precise speaker turn-taking; 2) a curriculum learning strategy for stable
speech-text alignment; 3) specialized strategies to enable stereo dialogue
generation. Additionally, recognizing the lack of open-source large-scale
spoken dialogue datasets, we curated OpenDialog, a 6.8k-hour spoken dialogue
dataset from in-the-wild speech data. Furthermore, we established a benchmark
to comprehensively evaluate various models. Experimental results demonstrate
that ZipVoice-Dialog achieves superior performance in intelligibility, speaker
turn-taking accuracy, speaker similarity, and inference speed. Our codes, model
checkpoints, demo samples, and the OpenDialog dataset are all publicly

TL;DR: NLA uses can-do descriptors with LLMs for language assessment, showing competitive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can interpret and apply human-like assessment descriptors for language tasks.

Method: Used Qwen 2.5 72B in a zero-shot setting to assess responses from the S&I Corpus, comparing it to fine-tuned speech LLMs and a BERT-based model.

Result: NLA achieved competitive performance, surpassing BERT but not fine-tuned LLMs; effective in mismatched tasks and generalizable.

Conclusion: NLA is a viable, interpretable approach for language assessment, leveraging textual descriptors without task-specific training.

Abstract: Natural language-based assessment (NLA) is an approach to second language
assessment that uses instructions - expressed in the form of can-do descriptors
- originally intended for human examiners, aiming to determine whether large
language models (LLMs) can interpret and apply them in ways comparable to human
assessment. In this work, we explore the use of such descriptors with an
open-source LLM, Qwen 2.5 72B, to assess responses from the publicly available
S&I Corpus in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that this approach -
relying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while
it does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it
surpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves
particularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other
data types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is
grounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending the Transformer decoder's autoregressive next-token prediction to audio generation is challenging due to audio's continuous nature. The paper aims to address this by modeling continuous-valued tokens without discretization.

Method: The authors use token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution of next tokens and propose a masked next-token prediction task within a causal LM framework.

Result: The method achieves 20-40% relative gains over AudioGen in FAD and KL divergence and matches SOTA diffusion models with fewer parameters (193M Base, 462M Large).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous audio generation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become
a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable
success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm
to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We
research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete
tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution
of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant
improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40%
relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a
novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction
into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%
relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)
models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion
models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer
parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.

TL;DR: A novel method using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with UTMOS for speech enhancement improves perceptual quality, outperforming traditional LM-based SE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LM-based SE methods focus on likelihood of clean speech tokens, which may misalign with human perception. This work aims to align SE outputs with perceptual preferences.

Method: Leverages DPO and UTMOS (a neural MOS prediction model) to guide optimization toward perceptually preferred speech outputs.

Result: Experiments show up to 56% relative improvement in speech quality metrics on the 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge test sets.

Conclusion: First application of DPO to SE, demonstrating a promising direction for perceptually aligned speech enhancement.

Abstract: This work investigates speech enhancement (SE) from the perspective of
language models (LMs). We propose a novel method that leverages Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the perceptual quality of enhanced
speech. Using UTMOS, a neural MOS prediction model, as a proxy for human
ratings, our approach guides optimization toward perceptually preferred
outputs. This differs from existing LM-based SE methods that focus on
maximizing the likelihood of clean speech tokens, which may misalign with human
perception and degrade quality despite low prediction error. Experiments on the
2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge test sets demonstrate that applying DPO
to a pretrained LM-based SE model yields consistent improvements across various
speech quality metrics, with relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge,
this is the first application of DPO to SE and the first to incorporate proxy
perceptual feedback into LM-based SE training, pointing to a promising
direction for perceptually aligned SE.

*Malte Algren,Tobias Golling,Francesco Armando Di Bello,Christopher Pollard*

TL;DR: A calibration method using optimal transport addresses discrepancies between ML simulations and experimental data, improving jet tagging performance in particle physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrepancies between simulations and experimental data limit ML effectiveness in particle physics.

Method: A calibration approach based on optimal transport is applied to high-dimensional simulations.

Result: Calibrated high-dimensional jet representations improve downstream tasks, enabling better use of jet flavor information in LHC analyses.

Conclusion: This framework advances foundation models in particle physics and has broader applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in
sensitivity across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has
relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However,
due to the sophistication of modern machine learning (ML) algorithms and their
reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and
experimental data can significantly limit the effectiveness of ML techniques.
In this work, we present a solution to this ``mis-specification'' problem: a
calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to
high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance
of our approach through jet tagging, using a CMS-inspired dataset. A
128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose
classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent''
representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for
downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated
high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor
information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing
properly-calibrated ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly,
this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting
high-dimensional simulations across the sciences.

TL;DR: An integrated framework combining HMM and MTGCN for predictive causal inference, addressing spatiotemporal complexities in biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional single-model approaches in estimating treatment effects for diseases like cancer, dementia, and Parkinson's.

Method: Combines HMM for spatial health state estimation and MTGCN for temporal outcome trajectories, treating temporal/spatial info asymmetrically in outcome regression and propensity score models.

Result: Simulation studies show enhanced bias correction and predictive accuracy in challenging clinical domains.

Conclusion: The framework advances predictive causal inference by adapting to spatiotemporal complexities in biomedical data.

Abstract: This study introduces an integrated framework for predictive causal inference
designed to overcome limitations inherent in conventional single model
approaches. Specifically, we combine a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for spatial
health state estimation with a Multi Task and Multi Graph Convolutional Network
(MTGCN) for capturing temporal outcome trajectories. The framework
asymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as
endogenous variables in the outcome regression, and exogenous variables in the
propensity score model, thereby expanding the standard doubly robust treatment
effect estimation to jointly enhance bias correction and predictive accuracy.
To demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer,
dementia, and Parkinson disease, where treatment effects are challenging to
observe directly. Simulation studies are conducted to emulate latent disease
dynamics and evaluate the model performance under varying conditions. Overall,
the proposed framework advances predictive causal inference by structurally
adapting to spatiotemporal complexities common in biomedical data.

TL;DR: The study reveals high redundancy in ML datasets for electronic structure, showing that smaller datasets can achieve accurate predictions without exhaustive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that large datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions in electronic structure, given the high cost of generating such data.

Method: Analyzed redundancy in datasets across material systems, tested random and coverage-based pruning strategies, and compared with importance-based pruning.

Result: Coverage-based pruning retains accuracy with 100-fold less data and reduces training time, while importance-based pruning fails at higher pruning factors.

Conclusion: Redundancy in electronic structure data can be leveraged to identify minimal essential datasets, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets
generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations.
This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets
across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and
complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large,
exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic
structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce
dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art
coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model
generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by
threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods,
which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher
pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage.
This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure
data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset
representative of each material class.

*Ashish S. Nair,Narendra Singh,Marco Panesi,Justin Sirignano,Jonathan F. MacArt*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A physics-constrained machine learning framework improves hypersonic flow modeling by augmenting transport models and boundary conditions, outperforming traditional NSF models in nonequilibrium regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical continuum models fail in transition-continuum regimes (Knudsen number 0.1-10), necessitating better methods for nonequilibrium effects like velocity slip and temperature jump.

Method: Deep learning PDE models (DPMs) for viscous stress and heat flux, trained via adjoint-based optimization, and a skewed-Gaussian wall model replace empirical slip conditions.

Result: The framework achieves improved accuracy, especially at high-Mach and high-Knudsen numbers, with strategies like parallel training enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: Data-driven, physics-consistent methods extend continuum solvers' applicability in hypersonic flows where traditional models fail.

Abstract: Modeling rarefied hypersonic flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the
breakdown of classical continuum assumptions in the transition-continuum
regime, where the Knudsen number ranges from approximately 0.1 to 10.
Conventional Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) models with empirical slip-wall
boundary conditions fail to accurately predict nonequilibrium effects such as
velocity slip, temperature jump, and shock structure deviations. We develop a
physics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models
and boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in
nonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs)
for the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained
via adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional
supersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers.
Additionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian
approximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model
replaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven
boundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our
results show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the
skewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly
improved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes.
Strategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and
inclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model
generalization. Increasing model complexity yields diminishing returns for
out-of-sample cases, underscoring the need to balance degrees of freedom and
overfitting. This work establishes data-driven, physics-consistent strategies
for improving hypersonic flow modeling for regimes in which conventional
continuum approaches are invalid.

TL;DR: WellPINN improves fluid pressure representation near wells in reservoir models using sequentially trained PINNs, addressing early-stage inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINN-based methods struggle with accurate fluid pressure representation near wells, especially early in injection.

Method: Proposes WellPINN, a workflow using multiple sequentially trained PINNs to iteratively approximate well dimensions via shrinking subdomains.

Result: Demonstrates accurate fluid pressure inference throughout injection, enhancing PINN utility for inverse modeling.

Conclusion: WellPINN advances PINN-based reservoir modeling by improving well representation, with open data/code availability.

Abstract: Accurate representation of wells is essential for reliable reservoir
characterization and simulation of operational scenarios in subsurface flow
models. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a
promising method for reservoir modeling, offering seamless integration of
monitoring data and governing physical equations. However, existing PINN-based
studies face major challenges in capturing fluid pressure near wells,
particularly during the early stage after injection begins. To address this, we
propose WellPINN, a modeling workflow that combines the outputs of multiple
sequentially trained PINN models to accurately represent wells. This workflow
iteratively approximates the radius of the equivalent well to match the actual
well dimensions by decomposing the domain into stepwise shrinking subdomains
with a simultaneously reducing equivalent well radius. Our results demonstrate
that sequential training of superimposing networks around the pumping well is
the first workflow that focuses on accurate inference of fluid pressure from
pumping rates throughout the entire injection period, significantly advancing
the potential of PINNs for inverse modeling and operational scenario
simulations. All data and code for this paper will be made openly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and guarantee the stability of discrete attractors in neural networks, which are models of biological memory, under broader conditions.

Method: Analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum to derive stability conditions.

Result: All fixed points are stable below a critical load, influenced by neural activity statistics and activation functions.

Conclusion: Threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns offer computational benefits for stability.

Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of
biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could
only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a
theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of
networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By
directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that
all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the
classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural
activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation
function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of
threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

TL;DR: SimAgents is a multi-agent system automating parameter extraction and analysis for cosmological simulations, improving efficiency and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of cosmological simulations and manual parameter extraction from dense literature is time-consuming and error-prone.

Method: SimAgents uses specialized LLM agents for physics reasoning, validation, and tool execution, ensuring parameter consistency and compliance.

Result: Experiments on a dataset of 40+ simulations show strong performance, proving SimAgents' effectiveness.

Conclusion: SimAgents accelerates cosmological research by automating parameter extraction and analysis, with publicly available tools and datasets.

Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly
complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of
literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense
academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these
parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone
process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the
cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system
designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and
preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by
specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software
validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured
communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful,
internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological
parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in
published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation
types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of
SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate
scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks and models for pMHC-I interactions are biased by mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands.

Method: A structure-guided benchmark is designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances, spanning twenty HLA alleles.

Result: The benchmark reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences without experimental bias, and reveals limitations in state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors.

Conclusion: The geometry-aware design pipeline provides high structural integrity and diversity, serving as a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation.

Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on
identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting
potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases
present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of
novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided
benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on
crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA
alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet
reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural
generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we
demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at
recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs,
indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations.
Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted
structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets,
representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our

Motivation: The challenge of extracting actionable insights from diverse cancer datasets drives the need for advanced computational approaches, particularly FMs.

Method: The study examines ML/DL trends, methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources for multimodal data integration in oncology.

Result: Identifies state-of-the-art FMs, tools, and repositories, positioning them as groundwork for future large-scale AI models in cancer research.

Conclusion: FMs are foundational for revolutionizing oncology, bridging the gap between traditional ML and next-gen AI models.

Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data
modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical
factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and
heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models
(FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data
serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new
avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing
treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted
integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational
approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends
in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological
frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer
subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome
prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional
ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs
advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with
advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available
multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration.
We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the
essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale,
pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from
conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology,
while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era

Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of molecular networks driving innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma.

Method: Constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network from patient transcriptomic data, used reinforcement learning for multi-step intervention discovery, and applied explainable AI to interpret the policy.

Result: A 4-step temporary LOXL2 inhibition was the most effective strategy, erasing resistance signatures without sustained intervention.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis and a computational framework for identifying non-obvious interventions in complex systems.

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical
challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being
poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic
Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to
elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a
reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step
therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to
mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed
that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2
protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis
showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the
molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct
without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel,
time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance
and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious
intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

TL;DR: The paper studies LLM behavior in auctions, finding alignment with human risk-averse bidding and theoretical predictions, while also highlighting prompt sensitivity and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs as proxies for human bidders in auctions, reducing costs and enabling scalable experimental studies.

Method: Uses synthetic data generation and GPT-4 models to simulate auctions, testing LLM behavior across formats and prompts.

Result: LLMs mimic risk-averse human bidders, align with theory in strategy-proof auctions, and show prompt sensitivity.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a cost-effective, scalable tool for auction research, though prompt design significantly impacts performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language
models, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating
process to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs
-- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the
experimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction
formats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent
with risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical
predictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the
winner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are
not very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but
can improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental
model (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for
less than $\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than
modern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run
auction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design
specifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and
serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by applications such as cloud platforms allocating GPUs to users or
governments deploying mobile health units across competing regions, we study
the dynamic allocation of a reusable resource to strategic agents with private
valuations. Our objective is to simultaneously (i) maximize social welfare,
(ii) satisfy multi-dimensional long-term cost constraints, and (iii)
incentivize truthful reporting. We begin by numerically evaluating primal-dual
methods widely used in constrained online optimization and find them to be
highly fragile in strategic settings -- agents can easily manipulate their
reports to distort future dual updates for future gain.
  To address this vulnerability, we develop an incentive-aware framework that
makes primal-dual methods robust to strategic behavior. Our design combines
epoch-based lazy updates -- where dual variables remain fixed within each epoch
-- with randomized exploration rounds that extract approximately truthful
signals for learning. Leveraging carefully designed online learning subroutines
that can be of independent interest for dual updates, our mechanism achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ social welfare regret, satisfies all cost
constraints, and ensures incentive alignment. This matches the performance of
non-strategic allocation approaches while being robust to strategic agents.

TL;DR: The TREC Deep Learning track's fifth year focused on passage and document ranking using MS MARCO datasets, introducing synthetic queries via T5 and GPT-4. LLM-prompted runs outperformed previous methods, with synthetic queries showing comparable results to human ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ranking tasks by leveraging larger, cleaner datasets and exploring the effectiveness of synthetic queries generated by advanced models like T5 and GPT-4.

Method: Repeated last year's design with MS MARCO v2 datasets, introduced synthetic queries via T5 and GPT-4, and evaluated using human and synthetic queries.

Result: LLM-prompted runs outperformed previous methods. Synthetic queries yielded similar results to human queries (τ=0.8487 agreement). No clear bias was observed.

Conclusion: Synthetic queries are viable for evaluation, and LLM prompting shows promise for ranking tasks, though human oversight is needed for query selection.

Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,
based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with
passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using
labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO
queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike
the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more
difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO
(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a
fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model
(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach,
which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last
year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in
other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not
just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar
results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$.
However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries
that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4
were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using
T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in structured debating and their evaluation of debate utterances.

Method: Deployed six leading LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Debate and Evaluation, measuring four metrics: Quality, Quantity, Manner, and Relation.

Result: LLMs perform well when given related arguments but tend to be verbose. They are consistent in evaluation.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective in structured debates and evaluation but need refinement to reduce verbosity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong conversational abilities. In
this Working Paper, we study them in the context of debating in two ways: their
ability to perform in a structured debate along with a dataset of arguments to
use and their ability to evaluate utterances throughout the debate. We deploy
six leading publicly available models from three providers for the
Retrieval-Augmented Debate and Evaluation. The evaluation is performed by
measuring four key metrics: Quality, Quantity, Manner, and Relation. Throughout
this task, we found that although LLMs perform well in debates when given

### [583] [GraphRunner: A Multi-Stage Framework for Efficient and Accurate Graph-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08945)
*Savini Kashmira,Jayanaka L. Dantanarayana,Krisztián Flautner,Lingjia Tang,Jason Mars*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GraphRunner is a new graph-based retrieval framework that improves accuracy and efficiency by introducing multi-hop exploration and validation stages, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with structured datasets like knowledge graphs due to reasoning errors and hallucinations in LLMs.

Method: GraphRunner operates in three stages: planning, verification, and execution, enabling multi-hop traversal and reducing errors.

Result: GraphRunner achieves 10-50% performance gains, reduces inference cost by 3.0-12.9x, and cuts response time by 2.5-7.1x.

Conclusion: GraphRunner is more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are common in
text-based applications. However, they struggle with structured, interconnected
datasets like knowledge graphs, where understanding underlying relationships is
crucial for accurate retrieval. A common direction in graph-based retrieval
employs iterative, rule-based traversal guided by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Such existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop
traversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and
hallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.
  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based
retrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning,
verification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that
enable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic
traversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined
traversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations
before execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and
detects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench
dataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches,
achieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while
reducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x,
making it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval
tasks.

*Tuan-Luc Huynh,Thuy-Trang Vu,Weiqing Wang,Trung Le,Dragan Gašević,Yuan-Fang Li,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MixLoRA-DSI is a framework for efficient generative retrieval updates using a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts and OOD-driven expansion, reducing parameter growth and training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating model-based indexes for new documents is computationally expensive; a resource-efficient solution is needed.

Method: Combines expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts with OOD-driven expansion to selectively add experts for new documents.

Result: Outperforms full-model update baselines on NQ320k and MS MARCO Passage with minimal parameter overhead and lower training costs.

Conclusion: MixLoRA-DSI offers a practical, efficient solution for updating generative retrieval models with new documents.

Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new
documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive
and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel
framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts
with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead
of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy
enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only
when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k
and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update
baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training
costs.

### [585] [PRISM: Fine-Grained Paper-to-Paper Retrieval with Multi-Aspect-Aware Query Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10057)
*Sangwoo Park,Jinheon Baek,Soyeong Jeong,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PRISM introduces fine-grained, aspect-specific document representations for scientific paper retrieval, improving performance by 4.3% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse abstracts, missing detailed document context. PRISM addresses this by leveraging full-text segmentation.

Method: PRISM decomposes query papers into aspect-specific views and matches them against similarly segmented candidate papers. SciFullBench provides a benchmark for full-text evaluation.

Result: PRISM outperforms baselines by an average of 4.3%.

Conclusion: PRISM's fine-grained approach enhances retrieval accuracy by capturing multifaceted document dimensions.

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document
retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query
paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have
focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full
documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide
only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a
novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple,
fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In
particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views
and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers
similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we
present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented
context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then,
experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3%
over existing retrieval baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to align offline metrics with online performance in recommender systems, validated via a large-scale e-commerce experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of linking offline metrics to real-world online performance in recommender systems.

Method: Uses Pareto front approximation to identify offline metrics that align with online impact, applicable to neural network-based systems.

Result: Validated on OTTO e-commerce platform, showing significant alignment between offline metrics and key online metrics (click-through rate, conversion rate, units sold).

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool for industry practitioners to make data-driven decisions by understanding offline-to-online metric relationships.

Abstract: A critical challenge in recommender systems is to establish reliable
relationships between offline and online metrics that predict real-world
performance. Motivated by recent advances in Pareto front approximation, we
introduce a pragmatic strategy for identifying offline metrics that align with
online impact. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to
simultaneously serve multiple test groups, each with distinct offline
performance metrics, in an online experiment controlled by a single model. The
method is model-agnostic for systems with a neural network backbone, enabling
broad applicability across architectures and domains. We validate the strategy
through a large-scale online experiment in the field of session-based
recommender systems on the OTTO e-commerce platform. The online experiment
identifies significant alignments between offline metrics and real-word
click-through rate, post-click conversion rate and units sold. Our strategy
provides industry practitioners with a valuable tool for understanding
offline-to-online metric relationships and making informed, data-driven
decisions.

### [587] [Evolution of Fear and Social Rewards in Prey-Predator Relationship](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09992)
*Yuji Kanagawa,Kenji Doya*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: The study explores the evolution of fear and social rewards in prey and predator interactions using a distributed evolutionary simulation. It reveals social reward is initially more critical for prey survival, with fear evolving later, and highlights the complex interplay between fear, social rewards, and predator traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how environmental conditions influence the evolution of fear and other rewards (e.g., food, social) in prey-predator dynamics, given the challenge of experimentally reproducing such evolution.

Method: A distributed evolutionary simulation was developed where prey and predator agents co-evolve innate reward functions and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning.

Result: Social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey survival initially, with fear-like negative reward evolving later. Predator traits (e.g., hunting ability) influence fear emergence, and positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats.

Conclusion: Fear and social reward have a complex evolutionary interplay, shaped by predator traits and environmental threats, suggesting fear evolved after social rewards and is influenced by predator behavior.

Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid
specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have
evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution
is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental
conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as
food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary
simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate
reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,
and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation
revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important
for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators
evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator
with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but
also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are
bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive
rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with
abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear
and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through
evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.

### [589] [Sequence-Model-Guided Measurement Selection for Quantum State Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09891)
*Jiaxin Huang,Yan Zhu,Giulio Chiribella,Ya-Dong Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A deep neural network with a sequence model architecture is introduced to optimize measurement choices for characterizing quantum systems, outperforming random measurements and suggesting boundary-focused strategies for topological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting optimal measurements for characterizing large quantum systems, which becomes intractable for traditional methods as system size grows.

Method: A deep neural network with a sequence model architecture is used to adaptively and data-drivenly search for efficient measurement choices.

Result: The neural network's measurement choices consistently outperform random measurements and suggest boundary-focused strategies for topological systems.

Conclusion: The neural network effectively identifies efficient measurement strategies, even uncovering boundary-bulk connections in topological systems without prior physics knowledge.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

*Jiangkai Wu,Zhiyuan Ren,Liming Liu,Xinggong Zhang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Artic is a framework for AI Video Chat that reduces latency by optimizing video streaming for MLLM understanding, focusing on chat-important regions and resilient frame handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI Video Chat introduces latency challenges due to MLLM inference and network instability, hindering real-time human-like interaction.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Video Streaming for bitrate reduction and Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate to handle packet loss. Introduces DeViBench to evaluate video quality impact on MLLM accuracy.

Result: Artic optimizes video streaming for AI understanding, reducing bitrate and improving resilience without compromising MLLM accuracy.

Conclusion: Artic addresses key challenges in AI Video Chat, paving the way for more seamless human-AI interaction, with open questions remaining for future work.

Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC),
where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM).
This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting
face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to
latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving
very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and
instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI
from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an
AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network
requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To
reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose
Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video
region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important
regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive
Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames
while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality
on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video
Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions
and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.

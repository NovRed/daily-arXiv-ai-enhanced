### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel iToF-RGB fusion framework that combines narrow-FOV iToF depth with wide-FOV RGB to achieve high-resolution depth maps with expanded field of view and improved structural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight depth sensing including low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view, and structural distortion in complex scenes.

Method: Reprojects iToF depth onto RGB coordinate system via geometric calibration, then uses dual-encoder fusion network with monocular depth priors to extract complementary features and perform depth super-resolution.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, structural consistency, and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates cross-modal cues to achieve enhanced depth accuracy, improved edge sharpness, and seamless field-of-view expansion.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Llad√≥s,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop is a training-free framework that enables diffusion models to generate images with precise object instance counts through iterative multimodal feedback and attention masking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with generating scenes containing exact numbers of object instances, especially in complex, high-density settings where precise instance control is needed.

Method: Uses iterative structured feedback alternating between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation. Includes language-guided planner/critic for object counting and spatial assessment, instance-driven attention masking, and compositional generation techniques.

Result: Achieves up to 98% counting accuracy on COCO Count, T2I CompBench and new high-instance benchmarks while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming baselines with 0.97 score.

Conclusion: CountLoop provides effective training-free instance control for diffusion models through structured iterative feedback and attention mechanisms, enabling precise object counting in complex scenes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with compositional generalization due to superposition in MLP neurons where individual neurons represent multiple features, hindering compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models perform well on standard tasks but fail at compositional generalization and object binding, limiting their ability to handle novel object-attribute combinations.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability techniques to analyze CLIP's vision encoder, specifically examining how individual neurons in MLP layers represent features through superposition.

Result: Found evidence that superposition in MLP neurons directly hinders compositional feature representation, which consequently affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities.

Conclusion: This study provides initial insights into the mechanistic roots of compositional failures in VLMs, serving as a foundation for future improvements in compositional generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav is a novel framework that addresses VLN challenges by integrating memory, spatial reasoning, and decision modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches using single LLMs suffer from poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon navigation tasks.

Method: MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module for dynamic map memory with selective node pruning, Spatial Module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference, and Decision Module for LLM-based path planning. Also introduces I-O-S dataset and fine-tunes Qwen3-4B into Qwen-Spatial model.

Result: Achieves higher F1 and NDCG scores on I-O-S test set for object list extraction. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on R2R and REVERIE datasets with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Conclusion: MSNav successfully addresses critical vulnerabilities in VLN by transforming fragile inference into robust, integrated intelligence through synergistic module fusion.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QA-VLM framework uses vision-language models with domain knowledge to provide interpretable quality assessment in additive manufacturing, outperforming standard VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning methods for image-based quality assessment in additive manufacturing lack interpretability and require human expertise, limiting real-world adoption.

Method: Leverages vision-language models' attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities, enriched with application-specific knowledge from peer-reviewed articles to generate human-interpretable quality assessments.

Result: Evaluated on 24 single-bead DED-LW samples, the framework shows higher validity and consistency in explanation quality compared to off-the-shelf VLMs.

Conclusion: The approach enables trustworthy, interpretable quality assessment in additive manufacturing applications.

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Loupe is a lightweight attention module that improves both accuracy and interpretability in fine-grained visual classification without needing part annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGVC requires identifying subtle visual cues for critical applications like biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, but current Vision Transformers lack interpretability needed for trust and verification.

Method: A novel plug-and-play attention module inserted into pre-trained backbones like Swin Transformer, trained end-to-end with composite loss function to focus on discriminative object parts without explicit annotations.

Result: Improves Swin-Base model accuracy on CUB-200-2011 dataset from 85.40% to 88.06% (2.66% gain) and provides clear visual explanations through attention maps that localize semantically meaningful features.

Conclusion: A simple intrinsic attention mechanism can serve as a powerful regularizer that significantly boosts performance while providing interpretable visual explanations for trustworthy decision-making in FGVC.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using CNN to analyze CT scans for predicting COVID-19 severity within one month of positive test, helping doctors make treatment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19 pandemic caused respiratory failure deaths due to overwhelmed healthcare systems and shortage of resources. Need for automated tools to assess infection severity from CT scans to aid medical decision-making.

Method: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on Computed Tomography (CT) scans of lungs to analyze COVID-19 infection severity.

Result: Model predicts whether COVID-19 infection will have promising outcome or unfavorable outcome (leading to intubation or death) within one month of positive test result.

Conclusion: Machine learning approach using CT scans can provide accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 infections, helping address healthcare system limitations and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

### [9] [MedRepBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Medical Report Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16674)
*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedRepBench is a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on structured medical report interpretation using 1,900 real Chinese medical reports with objective and subjective evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation quality in medical reports despite recent advances in vision-language and large language models.

Method: Built a comprehensive benchmark from 1,900 de-identified Chinese medical reports across diverse departments and formats. Includes text-only evaluation with OCR+LLM as upper-bound comparison. Uses objective field-level recall and automated subjective LLM scoring for factuality, interpretability, and reasoning.

Result: Applied GRPO to improve a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. OCR+LLM pipeline shows strong performance but suffers from layout-blindness and latency issues.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables controlled evaluation of medical report understanding and motivates progress toward robust, fully vision-based solutions that overcome OCR limitations.

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

### [10] [Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739)
*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight two-stage UAV framework for real-time wildfire monitoring using frame compression and improved YOLOv8 for fire detection with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs have limited computational resources, making real-time analysis with large models challenging for disaster emergency response like wildfire monitoring.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses policy network with frame compression to discard redundant clips and station point mechanism for accuracy. Stage 2 employs improved YOLOv8 model for fire source localization when fire is detected.

Result: Significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage 1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage 2 compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables efficient real-time wildfire monitoring on UAV platforms by balancing computational efficiency with detection accuracy through intelligent frame selection and optimized detection models.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

### [11] [CellEcoNet: Decoding the Cellular Language of Pathology with Deep Learning for Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma Recurrence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16742)
*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet is a spatially aware deep learning framework that treats pathology images as a language, with cells as words and tissue architecture as sentences, achieving superior recurrence prediction in lung adenocarcinoma compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma patients recur within five years after surgery, and current clinical tools fail to identify those who need adjuvant therapy, creating an unmet clinical need for better prognostic tools.

Method: CellEcoNet models whole slide images through natural language analogy, defining cells as words, cellular neighborhoods as phrases, and tissue architecture as sentences. It automatically learns context-dependent meanings and captures spatial interactions to derive recurrence risk.

Result: On 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8%, HR:9.54) compared to IASLC grading (AUC:71.4%), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%), and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). It demonstrated fairness across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups.

Conclusion: CellEcoNet represents a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular 'language' to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk, providing a powerful tool for prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

### [12] [A Framework for Benchmarking Fairness-Utility Trade-offs in Text-to-Image Models via Pareto Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16752)
*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinsk√º*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Pareto-optimal frontier method for evaluating fairness and utility in text-to-image models, showing most default hyperparameters are suboptimal and better configurations can be easily found.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation methods for text-to-image models rely on qualitative judgments and narrow comparisons, which are error-prone, difficult to replicate, and limit comprehensive assessment of both fairness and utility.

Method: Uses Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparameterization of debiasing methods, with Normalized Shannon Entropy for fairness and ClipScore for utility evaluation. Evaluates Stable Diffusion, Fair Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX models.

Result: Most default hyperparameterizations of text-to-image models are dominated solutions in the fairness-utility space, and better hyperparameters can be straightforwardly identified.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables reproducible comparison between different text-to-image models and provides a systematic approach to optimize both fairness and utility simultaneously.

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WebMMU is a multilingual benchmark that evaluates multimodal models on three core web tasks: visual QA, code editing, and mockup-to-code generation, revealing current models' limitations in reasoning and functional coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' web development capabilities across multiple languages and tasks, addressing the gap in assessing complex reasoning and functional UI comprehension.

Method: Developed WebMMU benchmark using expert-annotated real-world web data to assess three tasks: website visual QA, HTML/CSS/JavaScript code editing, and mockup-to-code generation across multiple languages.

Result: Multimodal LLMs perform well on basic information extraction but struggle with reasoning, element grounding, functional code editing, and generating multilingual design-to-code that maintains hierarchy.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant limitations in multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning, highlighting the need for improved capabilities to develop future web agents for automating web development tasks.

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

TL;DR: RoentGen-v2 is a text-to-image diffusion model that generates demographically balanced synthetic chest X-rays, enabling improved disease classification model performance (+6.5% accuracy) and fairness (+19.3% reduction in underdiagnosis gap) through synthetic pretraining followed by real data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations in medical imaging AI, particularly due to limitations in dataset scale and demographic diversity.

Method: Developed RoentGen-v2 text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs with demographic conditioning, created large synthetic dataset (565k+ images), and proposed synthetic pretraining followed by real data fine-tuning strategy.

Result: Synthetic pretraining improved downstream classification accuracy by 6.5% (vs 2.7% with naive combination), reduced underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%, and enhanced generalization across 137k+ real images from 5 institutions.

Conclusion: Synthetic imaging with demographic control enables more equitable and generalizable medical AI, with synthetic pretraining strategy outperforming naive data combination approaches under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Conclusion: OVODA enables effective open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection, and the accompanying OVAD dataset with comprehensive attribute annotations facilitates further research in this direction.

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve supernova detection by moving beyond conventional CNN methods and eliminating computationally expensive difference imaging processes.

Method: Transformer-based architecture designed for pixel-by-pixel comparison of search and template images only, without requiring difference images.

Result: Achieved 97.4% classification accuracy on DES autoScan dataset, with performance maintained even when images are not centered on supernova candidates.

Conclusion: The transformer network effectively enhances both accuracy and efficiency for supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA replaces diffusion action decoders with Normalizing Flows for faster one-shot sampling in Vision-Language-Action models, matching performance while significantly reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in VLAs require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference, limiting practicality for real-world high-frequency control applications.

Method: Replace diffusion action decoder with Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through invertible transformation. Integrated into FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tuned on LIBERO benchmark.

Result: NinA matches performance of diffusion-based counterpart under same training regime while achieving substantially faster inference.

Conclusion: NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-PGS is a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation paths from sparse path loss spectra using Planar Gaussians and fully-structured radio radiance, achieving accurate 6G Spatial-CSI modeling with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G requires large-scale antenna arrays and accurate spatial channel state information, but traditional channel modeling methods face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability. Radiance field-based methods suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Geometry training stage using Planar Gaussians for dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction; 2) RF training stage with fully-structured radio radiance and tailored multi-view loss to model radio propagation behavior.

Result: RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels compared to prior radiance field methods.

Conclusion: RF-PGS offers a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling by addressing geometric inaccuracy and supervision costs while maintaining high fidelity in radio propagation path reconstruction.

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPO is a novel deformable retinal image registration framework that uses Gaussian primitives at key anatomical structures to overcome vanishing gradient issues in homogeneous regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the FIRE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable retinal image registration is challenging due to large homogeneous regions and sparse vascular features that cause limited gradient signals in standard learning-based methods.

Method: Uses Gaussian Primitive Optimization with descriptor-based control nodes at key anatomical structures. Each node is modeled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable parameters. KNN Gaussian interpolation propagates displacement signals from information-rich nodes to create a globally coherent displacement field.

Result: On FIRE dataset: reduced target registration error from 6.2px to ~2.4px, increased AUC at 25px from 0.770 to 0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: GPO effectively addresses vanishing gradient issues in retinal image registration by strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient regions and using structured message passing, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM research focuses mainly on emotion recognition but neglects emotion reasoning, which is crucial for natural human-machine interactions. There's a need to better understand the causes and implications of emotions.

Method: Created MTMEUR benchmark with real-life video data and progressive questions covering emotion recognition, causes, and future predictions. Proposed a multi-agent framework with specialized agents for background context, character dynamics, and event details.

Result: Experiments showed most existing MLLMs face significant challenges with emotion reasoning tasks. The proposed multi-agent approach aims to address these limitations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark and framework to advance emotion reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, highlighting current model limitations and providing a foundation for future research in multimodal emotion understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Delta-SVD is a training-free compression method that uses SVD to compress DreamBooth fine-tuned models by exploiting the low-rank structure of weight deltas, achieving significant storage reduction with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DreamBooth fine-tuning creates large storage overhead when maintaining many subject-specific models, making deployment impractical for real-world applications requiring multiple customizations.

Method: Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize weight deltas from DreamBooth fine-tuning, followed by energy-based rank truncation to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with negligible loss in generation quality (measured by CLIP score, SSIM, FID) while preserving original model architecture and enabling on-the-fly reconstruction.

Conclusion: Delta-SVD provides a practical, scalable solution for efficient deployment of personalized diffusion models by enabling plug-and-play compressed models without additional training.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

TL;DR: MLLMsent framework uses Multimodal Large Language Models for visual sentiment analysis through three approaches: direct classification, LLM-assisted analysis on generated descriptions, and fine-tuning on sentiment-labeled descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding sentiment communication through visual content is crucial for social media interactions, but remains challenging due to complex scene-level semantics that current methods struggle to capture.

Method: Proposes MLLMsent framework with three perspectives: (1) direct sentiment classification using MLLMs, (2) associating MLLMs with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on generated image descriptions, and (3) fine-tuning LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4% respectively. In cross-dataset testing without training on new data, outperforms best runner-up by up to 8.26%.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential for advancing affective computing and establishes new benchmarks for visual sentiment analysis research, particularly highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuned approaches.

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AWM-Fuse is a novel multi-modality image fusion method that uses both global and local text perception to handle adverse weather conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the loss of visual information in adverse weather conditions and improve semantic perception by effectively incorporating textual information, which previous methods lacked in categorization and analysis.

Method: Uses a unified shared weight architecture with global feature perception (BLIP captions for overall scene features and degradation types) and local module (ChatGPT detailed descriptions for specific degradation effects). Text descriptions constrain fusion image generation to align with real semantic labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles multiple degradations through text perception and promotes learning of meaningful visual features, demonstrating superior performance in adverse weather scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

TL;DR: SAEViT is a lightweight Vision Transformer that combines sparse attention and convolutional blocks to reduce computation while maintaining performance, achieving 76.3-79.6% accuracy on ImageNet with only 0.8-1.3 GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers suffer from large model size, high computational cost, and weak local feature modeling, limiting their real-world applications. There's a need to balance computation efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes SAEViT with: 1) Sparsely Aggregated Attention module for adaptive sparse sampling and deconvolution recovery, 2) Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network for enhanced inter-channel information exchange, 3) Hierarchical pyramid structure with depth-wise separable convolutional blocks.

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3% and 79.6% on ImageNet-1K with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs respectively, demonstrating significant computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SAEViT provides an effective lightweight solution for vision tasks by combining sparse attention mechanisms with convolutional features, successfully addressing ViT's computational limitations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-dimensional image quality assessment framework that models quality across technical and aesthetic dimensions, then combines features for final scoring, enabling flexible image restoration aligned with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing IQA methods focus only on fitting overall scores, neglecting that humans evaluate image quality from multiple perceptual dimensions before arriving at overall assessment.

Method: MDIQA framework models image quality across 5 technical and 4 aesthetic dimensions in separate branches. Each branch trained separately, then features combined for final IQA score. Also enables flexible training of image restoration models by adjusting perceptual dimension weights.

Result: Extensive experiments show MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-dimensional approach better captures human visual perception and provides flexible application for image restoration based on varying user preferences.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image

*Qing Zhang,Jinguang Tong,Jie Hong,Jing Zhang,Xuesong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGS is a training-free framework that addresses the Janus problem in text-to-3D generation by enforcing multi-view consistency through structural energy guidance in diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-3D generation suffers from the Janus problem where objects appear correct from front view but have distorted geometry from other angles, caused by viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion priors.

Method: Proposes Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS) that defines structural energy in PCA subspace of U-Net features and injects its gradients into denoising trajectory to steer geometry toward intended viewpoints.

Result: SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts, achieves improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without requiring retraining or weight modifications.

Conclusion: SEGS provides an effective plug-and-play solution for multi-view consistency in text-to-3D generation, seamlessly integrating into existing SDS/VSD pipelines while preserving appearance fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

### [28] [MSPCaps: A Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network with Cross-Agreement Routing for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16922)
*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps is a novel Capsule Network architecture that integrates multi-scale feature learning with efficient capsule routing through a Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone, Patchify Capsule Layer, and Cross-Agreement Routing blocks to achieve superior classification performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CapsNet variants rely on single high-level feature maps and struggle with multi-scale feature fusion using conventional strategies like addition/concatenation, leading to suboptimal performance due to overlooked complementary multi-scale information.

Method: Three key components: 1) Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone extracts diverse multi-scale features; 2) Patchify Capsule Layer partitions features into primary capsules with uniform patch size; 3) Cross-Agreement Routing blocks adaptively route multi-scale capsules by identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement.

Result: Achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently surpassing baseline methods in classification accuracy with configurations from Tiny model (344.3K parameters) to Large model (10.9M parameters).

Conclusion: MSPCaps demonstrates significant potential in advancing feature representation learning by effectively integrating multi-scale features with capsule routing, overcoming limitations of conventional CapsNet architectures.

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

*Siqing Yuan,Yulin Wang,Zirui Cao,Yueyan Wang,Zehao Weng,Hui Wang,Lei Xu,Zixian Chen,Lei Chen,Zhong Xue,Dinggang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CC-CMR is a gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening framework using contrastive learning to align cine CMR with LGE sequences, achieving 94.3% accuracy without contrast agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMR screening relies on gadolinium contrast which is problematic for population-scale deployment due to contrast agent dependency and labor-intensive interpretation.

Method: Contrastive learning framework that aligns latent spaces of cine CMR and LGE sequences, with feature interaction module and uncertainty-guided adaptive training for cross-modal feature optimization.

Result: Achieved 0.943 accuracy (95% CI: 0.886-0.986) on multi-center data from 231 subjects, outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3%.

Conclusion: CC-CMR demonstrates clinical viability for wide population screening by eliminating gadolinium dependency while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Invert3D enables efficient 3D content personalization through natural language prompts by aligning 3D representations with text embedding spaces, eliminating the need for computationally expensive retraining procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D personalization methods rely on knowledge distillation that requires expensive retraining. Vision-language models enable direct 2D image personalization but cannot be directly applied to 3D content due to structural differences.

Method: Develops a camera-conditioned 3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding aligned with text embeddings, enabling manipulation through natural language prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content without requiring retraining procedures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between 3D content and text embedding spaces, enabling convenient and efficient 3D content personalization through natural language.

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

### [32] [NAT: Learning to Attack Neurons for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16937)
*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT introduces neuron-level adversarial attacks that target specific neurons rather than entire layers, achieving superior transferability across models and domains with significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous layer-level adversarial attacks disproportionately focus on few neurons representing similar concepts, leaving other neurons minimally affected. The authors aim to disrupt the fundamental units of neural networks for better transferability.

Method: Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT) shifts from embedding-level separation to neuron-specific targeting, focusing on individual neurons to disrupt core network units and improve cross-model transferability.

Result: NAT achieves fooling rates surpassing existing baselines by over 14% in cross-model and 4% in cross-domain settings on 41 ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models. It also achieves impressive fooling rates within just 10 queries.

Conclusion: Targeting individual neurons provides a more fundamental and effective approach for transferable adversarial attacks, demonstrating that neuron-specific disruption serves as a common basis for transferability across different models and domains.

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieroAction is a vision-language model that provides structured, interpretable assessments of human actions using stepwise reasoning and hierarchical policy learning, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action evaluation methods only provide final scores without explanations, limiting their practical applicability in domains like sports, healthcare, and robotics where interpretable reasoning is crucial.

Method: Combines Stepwise Action Reasoning (a tailored chain of thought process for action assessment) with Hierarchical Policy Learning (a reinforcement learning strategy that learns fine-grained sub-action dynamics and aligns them with high-level action quality).

Result: Superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating accurate and interpretable action assessments.

Conclusion: HieroAction effectively addresses the limitation of score-only evaluations by providing structured, explainable assessments through integrated reasoning and policy learning approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: RPD-Diff is a diffusion-based model for single-image dehazing that handles dense and non-uniform haze through physics-guided intermediate state targeting and adaptive denoising timestep prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient generation conditioning and lack adaptability to spatially varying haze distributions, leading to suboptimal restoration in dense and non-uniform haze conditions.

Method: Proposes RPD-Diff with Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST) strategy using physical priors to reformulate diffusion Markov chain, and Haze-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (HADTP) that dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising timesteps using transmission map cross-attention.

Result: Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets show RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, producing high-quality haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods by incorporating physics guidance and adaptive mechanisms, making it robust for complex haze scenarios with varying density and distribution.

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

### [35] [Local Information Matters: A Rethink of Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16970)
*Tianhang Pan,Xiuyi Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LIMM model emphasizing local modeling for crowd counting, using window partitioning and contrastive learning to handle small individuals while maintaining large individual counting capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rethink crowd counting where individuals occupy very small image portions, focusing on local modeling capability rather than large receptive fields used in existing works.

Method: LIMM model with window partitioning design (grid windows on input) and window-wise contrastive learning to distinguish local density levels, plus global attention module for large individuals.

Result: Significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7% MAE improvement on JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset) while maintaining large individual counting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Emphasizing local modeling capability through window partitioning and contrastive learning is effective for crowd counting, particularly for small individuals, without compromising performance on large individuals.

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RDR framework to enhance LVLMs' robustness against visual perturbations in scientific diagrams, proposing new metrics and a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs lack robustness to common visual perturbations (noise, blur, occlusions) in real-world scientific documents, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Proposes Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework with Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency Verification (AMCV) mechanism that generates multiple perturbed diagram versions, performs parallel inference, and uses consistency-based self-correction.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art LVLMs like GPT-4V suffer significant performance degradation (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%) on perturbed inputs.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical gap in LVLM evaluation and provides a framework to enhance robustness for scientific diagram processing in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

TL;DR: BSAM addresses imbalanced regression by reframing it as an imbalanced generalization problem, using a targeted reweighting strategy with sharpness-aware minimization to ensure uniform generalization across the observation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world regression data often has imbalanced distributions, causing poor performance for rare target values. Traditional regression models struggle with this imbalanced regression problem.

Method: Proposes Balanced Sharpness-Aware Minimization (BSAM) that combines traditional sharpness-aware minimization with a novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize generalization ability across the entire observation space.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks (age and depth estimation) show BSAM consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: BSAM effectively tackles imbalanced regression by ensuring uniform generalization ability, providing a theoretical generalization bound, and demonstrating superior performance across various computer vision regression tasks.

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs show insufficient robustness, hallucination, and reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios requiring precise image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning.

Method: Two-layered architecture: Global Contextual Perception for broad understanding and Fine-grained Local Grounding with Local Detail Enhancement Module and Semantic Consistency Validator, integrated through adaptive fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models (Flamingo, BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4) on GQA, A-OKVQA, and RefCOCO datasets with superior accuracy and significantly reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design effectively enhances fine-grained visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

*Bin Pan,Shiyu Shen,Zongbin Wang,Zhenwei Shi,Xia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JPS is a parameter-efficient domain generalization method that selectively fine-tunes a sparse subset of parameters in pre-trained models to preserve generalization while adapting to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of pre-trained vision models can compromise their intrinsic generalization capabilities. Parameter-efficient adaptation strategies are needed to balance task adaptation with preservation of generalization.

Method: Joint Parameter Selection (JPS) restricts updates to a small, sparse subset of parameters using dual operators to identify parameters with consistent and significant gradients across all source domains.

Result: Extensive benchmark experiments show JPS achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods.

Conclusion: JPS provides an efficient and effective approach for domain generalization by selectively fine-tuning parameters while maintaining the generalization strength of pre-trained models, with theoretical justification through generalization error bounds.

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: HiCache provides a fundamental improvement in feature prediction through mathematical alignment with empirical properties, offering significant acceleration without quality degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

*Riad Hassan,M. Rubaiyat Hossain Mondal,Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed,Fahad Mostafa,Md Mostafijur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDLDNet introduces an efficient dual-line decoder segmentation network that balances accuracy and computational efficiency for medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning segmentation methods fail to balance accuracy with computational efficiency - they either prioritize performance at high computational cost or compromise accuracy for efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes EDLDNet with a noisy decoder that incorporates structured perturbation during training for robustness but only uses noise-free decoder at inference. Utilizes Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules, Attention Gates, Up-Convolution Blocks, and a mutation-based loss function leveraging multi-scale segmentation masks from both decoders.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on four medical imaging datasets. Achieves 84.00% Dice score on Synapse dataset (13.89% improvement over UNet) while reducing MACs by 89.7%. Maintains comparable computational efficiency to recent approaches like EMCAD while achieving higher Dice scores.

Conclusion: EDLDNet demonstrates strong generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, establishing it as an effective solution for organ-at-risk segmentation in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPC is a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses LLMs to create category clusters capturing inter-class relationships and employs class-aware contrastive loss for better intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods focus too much on inter-class separation while neglecting shared semantics among related categories and lack fine-grained discrimination, leading to confusion among visually similar categories.

Method: Uses Large Language Models to derive category clusters encoding intrinsic inter-class relationships, and introduces a class-aware patch-level contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation in a hierarchical design.

Result: Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: CPC effectively addresses the limitations of previous WSSS methods by leveraging hierarchical semantic priors from LLMs and contrastive learning, achieving superior performance while maintaining cost-effectiveness through image-level labels.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining Gaussian Splatting's photorealism with structured marker representations for improved robotic simulation, featuring novel GS-based fiducial marker generation in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh-based 3D simulations struggle in complex environments like greenhouses, while neural rendering methods lack support for fiducial markers essential for robotic localization and control.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that integrates Gaussian Splatting's visual realism with structured marker representations, featuring a novel algorithm for efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers in cluttered scenes.

Result: Outperforms traditional image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy, successfully demonstrated in challenging greenhouse simulation environments with dense foliage and occlusions.

Conclusion: The framework shows significant value for real-world robotic applications, particularly in agricultural settings where complex visual environments push perception limits.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

### [45] [Dual Orthogonal Guidance for Robust Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17017)
*Konstantina Nikolaidou,George Retsinas,Giorgos Sfikas,Silvia Cascianelli,Rita Cucchiara,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG) to improve diffusion-based handwritten text generation by reducing artifacts and enhancing readability while maintaining style diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models for handwritten text generation suffer from memorization, style variability issues, and produce artifacts that affect readability, especially for challenging styles and out-of-vocabulary words.

Method: Introduces DOG - a novel sampling guidance strategy using orthogonal projection of negatively perturbed prompts onto positive prompts, combined with a triangular schedule to control guidance strength throughout denoising.

Result: Experimental results on DiffusionPen and One-DM show DOG improves content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and challenging writing styles.

Conclusion: DOG provides more stable and disentangled guidance than standard CFG, effectively steering generation away from artifacts while maintaining intended content and producing diverse, plausible outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTMA model uses probabilistic modeling and temporal masked attention for cross-view online action detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream OAD models are sensitive to varying video viewpoints, limiting their generalization to unseen sources. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a view-invariant approach.

Method: Proposes Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model with GRU-based temporal masked attention cell. Uses probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations and integrates multi-view information for view-invariant feature extraction.

Result: PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets under cross-subject, cross-view, and cross-subject-view evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The PTMA model effectively handles viewpoint variations in online action detection through probabilistic modeling and temporal attention mechanisms, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different views and subjects.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

*Mingliang Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Changhong Liu,Hanxi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) for deepfake detection that addresses CNN limitations by focusing on discriminative local features using Top-K pooling and regularization techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods based on reconstruction learning and deep CNNs show poor generalization across object categories and generation domains due to overfitting to semantic features and loss of local forgery cues through Global Average Pooling.

Method: Introduces Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) with Salience Network (SNet) and Top-K Pooling (TKP) module to select most informative local patterns. Uses Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS) regularization to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieves 3.7% improvement in accuracy and 2.8% increase in average precision over state-of-the-art NPR method, with exceptional efficiency of 1789 FPS on single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

Conclusion: LFM sets new benchmark for cross-domain deepfake detection by effectively addressing CNN limitations and improving generalization across categories and generation domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-scanned outdoor point clouds suffer from extreme sparsity that hinders 3D perception tasks, and existing upsampling methods focus on individual objects with limited generalization to complex scenes.

Method: Uses classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs with sparse point cloud as condition and nearby frames as input. Includes voxel completion module for feature refinement and point-voxel interaction module to integrate point and voxel features.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The method supports arbitrary upsampling rates and is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling approach.

Conclusion: PVNet effectively addresses LiDAR point cloud sparsity in outdoor environments through a diffusion-based framework with point-voxel interaction, demonstrating superior generalization and performance for scene-level upsampling.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous scene flow methods focused on two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable temporal information. Multi-frame approaches suffer from high computational costs as frame count increases, and scene flow estimation faces challenges like imbalanced class distributions and motion inconsistency.

Method: Proposes DeltaFlow framework with a delta scheme for efficient temporal feature extraction, Category-Balanced Loss to handle underrepresented classes, and Instance Consistency Loss to ensure coherent object motion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets with 22% lower error and 2x faster inference compared to next-best multi-frame supervised method, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: DeltaFlow provides an efficient and effective solution for scene flow estimation by leveraging temporal information with minimal computational cost and addressing class imbalance and motion consistency challenges.

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving true photorealism in dynamic game environments at real-time frame rates remains challenging due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance, despite recent hardware and rendering advancements.

Method: Proposes REGEN framework with dual-stage generative network that transforms unpaired image-to-image translation into simpler paired translation task, enabling lightweight training and real-time inference without compromising quality.

Result: Demonstrated on GTA V, achieves visual results comparable to robust unpaired Im2Im methods while improving inference speed by 32.14 times, outperforming directly trained lightweight unpaired methods.

Conclusion: REGEN provides an effective solution for real-time photorealism enhancement in games, balancing visual quality and performance through innovative dual-stage architecture and efficient training approach.

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSG-DiT is a novel framework for controllable video generation that uses spatial signal prompting and a dual-branch attention mechanism to improve semantic consistency with text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency and often deviate from nuanced details in text prompts, leading to poor alignment with user intentions.

Method: A decoupled two-stage process: 1) Spatial Signal Prompting generates visual prompts using pre-trained multi-modal models, 2) SSG-Adapter injects joint conditions into a frozen video DiT backbone with dual-branch attention.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark, particularly excelling in spatial relationship control and overall consistency metrics.

Conclusion: SSG-DiT effectively addresses semantic consistency issues in controllable video generation through spatial signal guidance and parameter-efficient adaptation, achieving superior performance over existing models.

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT's optimization is confined to modeling local relationships within images, limiting its ability to capture global geometric relationships between data points.

Method: Integrates ViT with proximal tools where ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through self-attention (each attention head corresponds to a tangent space), and proximal iterations define sections and project data from tangent spaces to base space for global feature alignment.

Result: Experimental results confirm the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in classification accuracy and data distribution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances feature representation and classification performance by enabling unified geometric optimization through the integration of ViT with proximal tools.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

*Pedro Silva,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Pablo Coelho,Vander Freitas,Gladston Moreira,David Menotii,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Loss combines proxy-based efficiency with D-Loss's distribution separability for scalable deep metric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DML methods face challenges: pairwise losses have complex sampling and slow convergence, proxy-based methods lack global distribution optimization, and D-Loss has high computational demands from large mini-batches.

Method: Proxy-Decidability Loss integrates learnable proxies with the statistical framework of decidability index (d') to estimate genuine and impostor distributions through proxies.

Result: PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained classification and face verification tasks.

Conclusion: PD-Loss offers a scalable, distribution-aware approach to embedding optimization with potential for broader applications in deep metric learning.

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

*Chengjie Jiang,Yunqi Zhou,Jiafeng Yan,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP is a reinforcement learning framework for geospatial pixel reasoning that uses MLLM-generated bounding boxes and points as prompts for segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results without mask supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based systems require expensive dense pixel supervision and perform poorly on out-of-domain data. The authors aim to create a more efficient and generalizable approach that leverages foundation model priors.

Method: A multimodal LLM generates task-relevant bounding boxes and positive points from vision-language instructions. These are passed to a pre-trained segmentation model as prompts. The system is optimized purely with reinforcement learning (GRPO) using format and accuracy rewards on boxes/points, without mask supervision.

Result: 4% improvement on in-domain benchmarks and up to 54% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model shows robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Complex geospatial segmentation behaviors can be effectively learned through reinforcement learning from weak spatial cues, demonstrating strong performance without expensive mask supervision.

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

TL;DR: SugarcaneLD-BD dataset and SugarcaneShuffleNet model provide efficient, lightweight solution for sugarcane leaf disease diagnosis in low-resource regions with 98.02% accuracy and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based plant diagnostics often fail in low-resource regions due to lack of scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools that can generalize under real-world conditions with limited computational resources.

Method: Created SugarcaneLD-BD dataset with 638 curated images across 5 classes, combined with additional datasets. Developed SugarcaneShuffleNet lightweight model optimized for on-device use, compared against 5 other CNN models via transfer learning and Bayesian optimization.

Result: SugarcaneShuffleNet achieved 98.02% accuracy, 0.98 F1-score, 4.14ms inference time per image with only 9.26MB model size, outperforming other models in resource efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The combination of curated dataset, optimized lightweight model, and practical web application provides an effective solution for real-time sugarcane disease diagnosis in resource-constrained agricultural environments.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

*Mirza Mumtaz Zahoor,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hybrid framework CE-RS-SBCIT integrates residual/spatial CNNs with transformers for brain tumor classification, achieving 98.30% accuracy on MRI datasets by addressing computational cost and sensitivity to contrast variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumors are lethal diseases requiring early detection. Current deep learning approaches (CNNs and Transformers) face challenges with computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.

Method: Proposed CE-RS-SBCIT framework with four innovations: 1) Smoothing and Boundary-based CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), 2) Tailored residual and spatial learning CNNs, 3) Channel enhancement strategy, 4) Novel spatial attention mechanism. Uses stem convolution and contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and boundary operations.

Result: Achieved superior performance on challenging MRI datasets (Kaggle and Figshare) with 98.30% accuracy, 98.08% sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision across glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy controls.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully addresses limitations of conventional methods by integrating local fine-grained and global contextual cues, demonstrating effective brain tumor classification with high accuracy and robustness to MRI data variations.

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video learning is passive, and current AI tools lack real-time, region-specific interaction capabilities for dynamic engagement with video content.

Method: Integrates GPT APIs with Computer Vision techniques, using annotated frames instead of raw coordinates to address GPT-4o's spatial weakness, with video pre-processing and real-time interaction architecture.

Result: Significantly improved accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content through the use of annotated frames rather than raw coordinate data.

AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video

weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.

TL;DR: Used implicit neural representation to combine T1w and T2w MRI advantages for isotropic upsampling of MTL subregion atlas, improving Alzheimer's disease biomarker accuracy without additional annotation work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI imaging biomarkers are crucial for Alzheimer's diagnosis, but anisotropic resolution in T2w MRI makes accurate cortical thickness extraction difficult in medial temporal lobe subregions where AD-related atrophy first appears.

Method: Employed implicit neural representation to combine resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI, upsampling MTL subregion atlas from anisotropic to isotropic space to create multi-modality high-resolution atlas set, then developed isotropic segmentation model.

Result: Isotropic model showed higher significance in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment from cognitively unimpaired participants, with greater biomarker stability in longitudinal analysis of CU participants.

Conclusion: Improved accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without increasing atlas annotation workload, enabling more precise quantification of AD-brain atrophy relationship and better disease tracking measures.

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

*Zhenghui Zhao,Chen Wu,Di Wang,Hongruixuan Chen,Cuiqun Chen,Zhuo Zheng,Bo Du,Liangpei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvCP method uses adversarial prompting to address background variation misclassification in weakly-supervised change detection, improving performance without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly-supervised change detection methods often misclassify background variations as object changes due to limited image-level supervision, especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Adversarial Prompt Mining - uses incorrect labels to activate erroneous feature mappings and identify problematic background variations; 2) Adversarial Sample Rectification - integrates adversarial samples via online global prototype built from weighted average of current and historical data.

Result: Significant performance enhancements demonstrated on ConvNet, Transformer, and SAM-based baselines. Method shows generalizability to other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios.

Conclusion: AdvCP effectively addresses co-occurring noise problem in WSCD, can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods without additional inference overhead, and shows broad applicability.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal pseudo-labeling method for generating cover images and summaries from text documents, using joint ranking of images and captions to create high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of existing datasets for cover image generation tasks that require producing both summaries and corresponding images from text-only documents.

Method: Collects documents with multiple images and captions, excludes factually inconsistent instances, ranks images and captions separately using gold summaries, selects images where both image and caption rank first, and removes documents with direct image references.

Result: The multimodal pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher quality images compared to text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively creates high-quality datasets for cover image generation tasks at low cost, outperforming methods that consider captions and images separately.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve comprehensive highway scene understanding with robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for deployment in resource-constrained environments and high-risk locations.

Method: Uses a large VLM (e.g., GPT-4o) contextualized with domain knowledge to generate task-specific chain-of-thought prompts, which guide a smaller efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) for reasoning over short videos and complementary multimodal data.

Result: Demonstrates consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions, validated on three specialized datasets including a multimodal pavement wetness dataset combining video with road weather sensor data.

Conclusion: The framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and applied to high-risk rural locations to enhance situational awareness and deliver timely alerts in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: Simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data (genomic and pathological) is challenging due to cost/technical limitations, but IHC biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal fusion analysis.

Method: Developed two teacher and one student models to extract modality-specific and modality-general features using MKD loss. Applied Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) and Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) for mutual learning between models.

Result: Superior performance in IHC biomarker prediction using uni-modal data on TCGA-BRCA and QHSU datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages multi-modal data during training while enabling flexible inference with either pathology slides alone or both modalities, addressing practical challenges in clinical settings.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Attention-augmented CNNs with targeted loss optimization and preprocessing provide highly accurate and computationally efficient tools for automated ALL diagnosis, potentially accelerating clinical workflows and improving decision-making.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVP is a 4D visual pre-training framework that uses next-point-cloud-prediction with diffusion models to improve 3D representations for robotics, boosting performance by 28% across manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained visual representations are mostly 2D-based, neglecting the 3D nature of the world, and there's a scarcity of large-scale 3D data for universal 3D representations.

Method: FVP frames visual pre-training as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem using diffusion models, pre-trained on larger public datasets to improve 3D representations.

Result: FVP boosts average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy by 28% across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and adapting well across various point cloud encoders and datasets.

Conclusion: FVP provides an effective alternative to direct 3D representation learning, significantly enhancing robotic manipulation performance and demonstrating broad applicability across different models and datasets.

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

*Xiaoyang Hao,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PersPose introduces Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation to address camera intrinsics and perspective distortion issues in monocular 3D human pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D HPE methods use cropped images without camera intrinsics, making relative depth estimation inaccurate. Human subjects appearing away from image center cause perspective distortions that complicate model fitting.

Method: Proposes Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode camera intrinsics of cropped images, and Perspective Rotation (PR) to center human subjects and reduce perspective distortions. Combines these into PersPose framework.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: MPJPE of 60.1 mm on 3DPW (7.54% improvement over previous SOTA), and strong results on MPI-INF-3DHP and Human3.6M datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating camera intrinsics and addressing perspective distortions through PE and PR significantly improves monocular 3D human pose estimation accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoViPAL is a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that uses a lightweight Plug-and-Play Pruning Module to remove redundant vision tokens in LVLMs, improving inference efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models generate thousands of vision tokens from images, causing high computational costs and memory overhead during prefilling and decoding stages. Existing pruning methods struggle in shallow layers due to insufficient contextual information.

Method: Proposes CoViPAL with a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) that predicts and removes redundant vision tokens before processing by LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of LVLM architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision.

Conclusion: CoViPAL provides a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy, effectively addressing visual token redundancy even in shallow layers.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

### [73] [Uncovering and Mitigating Destructive Multi-Embedding Attacks in Deepfake Proactive Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17247)
*Lixin Jia,Haiyang Sun,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS) to protect deepfake proactive forensics from Multi-Embedding Attacks that destroy original watermarks when images undergo multiple watermark embedding rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake forensic methods assume single watermark embedding, but real-world scenarios involve multiple embedding attacks that render current proactive forensic mechanisms ineffective by destroying original watermarks.

Method: Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS) training paradigm that simulates multi-embedding attack scenarios during fine-tuning, uses resilience-driven loss function to enforce sparse and stable watermark representations without modifying network architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show AIS significantly enhances robustness of various existing methods against multi-embedding attacks, enabling correct extraction of original watermarks even after second embedding.

Conclusion: AIS provides a plug-and-play solution to address the critical vulnerability of multi-embedding attacks in deepfake proactive forensics, making watermark-based source tracking reliable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICPNet is a novel deep network that improves machine perception of illusory contours to better align with human vision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on abutting grating tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks fail to perceive illusory contours like humans do, creating a misalignment between machine and human perception that needs to be addressed for higher machine intelligence.

Method: Proposed ICPNet with three key modules: multi-scale feature projection (MFP) for multi-scale representations, feature interaction attention module (FIAM) for feedforward-feedback interaction, and edge fusion module (EFM) with shape constraints inspired by human shape bias.

Result: ICPNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in sensitivity to abutting grating illusory contours, with notable top-1 accuracy improvements across AG-MNIST and AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets.

Conclusion: This work represents a step toward human-level intelligence for DNN-based models by better aligning machine perception with human visual cognition patterns.

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated layer classification from optical microscopy is challenging due to substantial appearance shifts across different 2D materials, making quantum flake identification difficult for scalable quantum hardware.

Method: Freezes backbone and base head trained on reference material, learns material-specific prompts, embeddings, and delta heads for each new material. Uses prompt pool and cosine-similarity gate to modulate features, and incorporates memory replay with knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and prompt-based baselines.

Conclusion: CLIFF represents the first systematic study of continual learning for 2D material classification, enabling effective differentiation between materials and their properties while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning

TL;DR: AdaGAT is a novel adversarial distillation method that dynamically adjusts a learnable guide model's training state to better transfer robustness to student models, outperforming baseline methods across multiple datasets and attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods struggle to maintain optimal guide model states during co-training, limiting effective robustness transfer from teacher to student models.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) with two separate loss functions that allow the guide model to participate more actively in backpropagation to achieve optimal state for robustness transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet show enhanced target model robustness across various adversarial attacks compared to baseline models when guide model is adjusted within appropriate accuracy range.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of guide model training state significantly improves robustness transfer in adversarial distillation, making AdaGAT an effective method for creating robust lightweight DNN models.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct

TL;DR: Deep learning models for automated sarcopenia assessment using CT scans, achieving 93% dice similarity and ¬±3% error in skeletal muscle area measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcopenia leads to poor surgical outcomes but current manual SMA measurement in CT scans is time-consuming and adds clinical workload, limiting timely detection and management.

Method: Used transfer learning and self-supervised learning approaches with labeled and unlabeled CT scan datasets to develop deep-learning models for automated SMA measurement at L3 vertebra.

Result: Model predicted SMA with average error of ¬±3 percentage points against manual measurements, and achieved 93% dice similarity coefficient for segmentation masks.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for full automation of sarcopenia assessment, addressing class imbalance and limited data issues while providing precise quantitative assessment.

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBT tracking methods have limitations in feature interaction due to regular fusion paradigms and fixed tracking templates, which restrict robust multi-modality representation learning.

Method: Proposes MTNet with modality-aware network (CADM and SSPM modules) for modality-specific cues, transformer fusion for global dependencies, trident prediction head for precise localization, and dynamic update strategy for reliable template maintenance.

Result: Achieves satisfactory results compared to state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while maintaining real-time processing speed.

Conclusion: The proposed MTNet framework effectively addresses RGBT tracking challenges through modality-aware feature extraction and dynamic template management, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of compositional visual reasoning research from 2023-2025, covering 260+ papers, paradigm shifts, benchmarks, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in dedicated synthesis of compositional visual reasoning literature and provide a systematic review of this rapidly expanding field.

Method: Systematic review of 260+ papers from top venues, formalization of core definitions, analysis of five-stage paradigm shift, and cataloging of 60+ benchmarks and metrics.

Result: Provides a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap of paradigm shifts, comprehensive benchmark analysis, and identification of key insights and open challenges.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational reference for compositional visual reasoning research, highlighting future directions including world-model integration, human-AI collaboration, and richer evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

### [84] [FoundDiff: Foundational Diffusion Model for Generalizable Low-Dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17299)
*Zhihao Chen,Qi Gao,Zilong Li,Junping Zhang,Yi Zhang,Jun Zhao,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff is a foundational diffusion model that provides unified low-dose CT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions using a two-stage approach with dose-anatomy perception and adaptive denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based LDCT denoising methods struggle with diverse noise characteristics and anatomical heterogeneity across different scanning conditions, limiting their generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios.

Method: Two-stage strategy: (1) Dose-anatomy perception using DA-CLIP with contrastive learning for continuous dose representations and anatomical identification, (2) Adaptive denoising using DA-Diff that integrates learned embeddings via novel dose and anatomy conditional blocks based on Mamba architecture.

Result: Superior denoising performance over state-of-the-art methods on two public LDCT datasets with eight dose levels and three anatomical regions, with remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels.

Conclusion: FoundDiff demonstrates strong generalizability and robustness for clinical LDCT denoising across diverse dose levels and anatomical regions, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

*Peilin Xiong,Junwen Chen,Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosBridge is a training-free framework for localized subject-driven image editing that uses positional embedding transplant and Corner Centered Layout to efficiently insert custom objects into target scenes while maintaining structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation, highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks for localized subject-driven image editing.

Method: Uses positional embedding transplant to guide diffusion models to replicate structural characteristics of reference objects, combined with Corner Centered Layout that concatenates reference and background images as input to FLUX.1-Fill model during progressive denoising.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PosBridge showcases practical value and potential for broad adoption as an efficient and flexible framework for inserting custom objects into images without requiring training.

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

### [86] [First Place Solution to the MLCAS 2025 GWFSS Challenge: The Devil is in the Detail and Minority](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17305)
*Songliang Cao,Tianqi Hu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winning solution for MLCAS 2025 wheat segmentation challenge using ViT-Adapter baseline with three stem-focused improvements: dynamic upsampler, semi-supervised distillation, and test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods are already mature, so success requires focusing on the specific problem nature - wheat stems have fine structure and class imbalance issues that need specialized solutions.

Method: ViT-Adapter baseline enhanced with: 1) SAPA dynamic upsampler for detail delineation, 2) semi-supervised guided distillation with stem-aware sample selection, 3) test-time scaling strategy to zoom and segment images twice.

Result: Achieved first place in the competition, outperforming second place by clear margins.

Conclusion: Simple but targeted improvements addressing the specific challenges of wheat stem segmentation can significantly boost performance in specialized agricultural computer vision tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

### [87] [Defending Deepfake via Texture Feature Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17315)
*Xiao Zhang,Changfang Chen,Tianyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proactive Deepfake detection using texture-guided invisible perturbations that target facial texture regions to disrupt Deepfake generation while remaining imperceptible to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deepfake detection methods are mostly passive and struggle with high-quality fakes. Proactive defense by inserting invisible signals before image editing offers a more effective approach to combat Deepfake threats to social trust and information security.

Method: Texture-guided perturbation framework that uses Local Binary Patterns to extract facial texture features, applies localized perturbations to key texture regions with low perceptual saliency, and employs a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture perturbations.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets show promising performance in distorting Deepfake generation and producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, demonstrating effective proactive detection.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection by leveraging texture features to create imperceptible perturbations that effectively disrupt Deepfake generation while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the scarcity of measured spectral BRDF data and enable photorealistic spectral rendering from conventional RGB images, which is essential for realistic material representation across different wavelengths.

Method: Proposes SpecGen method with Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network that models reflectance responses across wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, leveraging abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation from limited spectral measurements.

Result: Accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral image reconstruction, achieving 8 dB improvement in PSNR.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses spectral BRDF generation challenges by effectively utilizing RGB data to compensate for limited spectral measurements, enabling high-quality spectral rendering from single RGB inputs.

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMCRICBENCH-3K is a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models on cricket scorecard VQA, featuring 3K synthetic scorecard images (English and Hindi) with English QA pairs to test numerical reasoning and cross-lingual generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current LVLMs' ability to handle complex numerical reasoning over semi-structured tabular images and cross-lingual generalization, particularly for domain-specific content like cricket scorecards.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1,463 synthetically generated cricket scorecard images (ODI, T20, Test formats) and 1,500 English QA pairs, including English and Hindi scorecard subsets with identical English questions for controlled evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art LVLMs (GPT-4o, Qwen2.5VL) struggle significantly on English scorecards and show further performance drop on Hindi scorecards, revealing limitations in structure-aware text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes critical weaknesses in current LVLMs and provides a publicly available dataset to promote research in improving visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual capabilities for semi-structured tabular data.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated
scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English
QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English
scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging
Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDA-Net is a novel AI-generated image detection framework that preserves full-resolution details through feature aggregation of local tiles and global views, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 13% accuracy improvement on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods struggle with high-resolution images due to resizing/cropping practices that lose subtle artifacts and high-frequency details, creating a need for approaches that preserve native-resolution information.

Method: Proposes HiDA-Net with Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) that fuses features from multiple full-resolution local tiles with down-sampled global view, plus Token-wise Forgery Localization and JPEG Quality Factor Estimation modules for robustness against manipulations and compression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 13% accuracy increase on Chameleon dataset and 10% improvement on the new HiRes-50K benchmark (50,568 images up to 64MP).

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses high-resolution detection challenges by ensuring no pixel information is lost, providing robust performance against various manipulations, and introduces a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

*Jiazi Bu,Pengyang Ling,Yujie Zhou,Yibin Wang,Yuhang Zang,Tong Wu,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiCache is a training-free adaptive caching strategy that uses shallow-layer feature analysis to dynamically determine when and how to cache during diffusion model inference, achieving better efficiency and visual quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caching-based acceleration methods for diffusion models rely on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors, which have limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples due to the dynamic nature of diffusion processes.

Method: DiCache consists of two components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme that uses shallow-layer features to obtain real-time caching error priors for autonomous caching schedule determination, and (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment that combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer feature trajectories to better approximate current features.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiCache achieves higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.

Conclusion: DiCache provides a unified framework for adaptive caching in diffusion models by leveraging shallow-layer feature correlations and trajectory similarities, enabling training-free acceleration with better generalization and visual quality.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGen framework unifies diverse conditional inputs for image generation using CoMoE module to reduce redundancy and WeaveNet for better backbone-control branch interaction, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods train separate control branches for each condition type, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient computational resource usage.

Method: Proposes Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module to aggregate similar patch features and assign to expert modules, plus WeaveNet dynamic connection mechanism for backbone-control branch interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets show state-of-the-art performance across various conditional image generation tasks.

Conclusion: UniGen framework effectively addresses parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness for multi-condition image generation.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

TL;DR: Joint optimization of multimodal retriever with LVLM for medical diagnosis, outperforming standard RAG and achieving competitive results with medical-pretrained models using only general-purpose backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical decision-making by retrieving relevant visual information from medical literature and hospital records, addressing limitations of standard RAG where error signals don't propagate to the retriever.

Method: Developed a model where multimodal retriever is jointly optimized with LVLM for medical diagnosis, using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. Joint optimization significantly improved challenging cases over standard RAG, though oracle analysis shows large performance gap remains.

Conclusion: While correct diagnosis is frequently achievable with top retrieved images, there's substantial room for improvement as current methods (including frontier LVLM rerankers) don't close the performance gap from oracle, indicating need for future methodological advances.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of image enhancement in complex
underwater scenes by proposing a solution based on deep learning. The proposed
method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models,
VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities
to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater
images. By constructing a unified model, the complementary advantages of the
two models are effectively integrated, achieving a more comprehensive and
accurate image enhancement effect.To objectively evaluate the enhancement
effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and
hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual

*Haoyu Wang,Hao Tang,Donglin Di,Zhilu Zhang,Wangmeng Zuo,Feng Gao,Siwei Ma,Shiliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCo is a novel human video generation framework that decouples structure and appearance generation to produce realistic whole-body human motion from text prompts, addressing limitations of existing methods that prioritize appearance over motion coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models focus too much on appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic human movements with poor structural coherence. Most datasets are limited to facial/upper-body motions or simple dance videos, restricting the scope of generation methods.

Method: MoCo decouples human video generation into two components: 1) an efficient 3D structure generator produces human motion sequences from text prompts, and 2) appearance synthesis guided by the generated structural sequence. It introduces Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and dense tracking constraints for fine-grained control.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos with complex whole-body motions.

Conclusion: The proposed MoCo framework effectively addresses the challenge of generating consistent human motion from text by separating structure and appearance generation, supported by a new large-scale whole-body human video dataset with diverse motions.

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic

*Bin Huang,Zhong Liu,Huiying Wen,Bingsheng Huang,Xin Chen,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM is an efficient Bayesian adaptation framework for SAM that enables uncertainty-aware medical image segmentation with real-time inference, improved accuracy, and enhanced interpretability while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key limitations of Bayesian adaptation for SAM in medical segmentation: instability in Bayesian fine-tuning, high computational cost due to massive parameters, and lack of interpretability from SAM's black-box design.

Method: Combines Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficient Bayesian adaptation without training, and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) with learnable spline activations for improved interpretability and token pruning.

Result: Achieves real-time inference (0.03s/image), superior segmentation accuracy (89.0% DSC vs 88.3% for MedSAM), identifies four critical decision-making tokens, and demonstrates effectiveness across five ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM successfully bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs by unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

*Patrick Ramos,Ryan Ramos,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis reveals data leakage exists in all visual datasets studied, compromising fair model evaluation through various types of leakage from severe to subtle cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate data leakage in visual datasets where evaluation benchmark images appear in training data, which undermines fair model assessment, especially since large datasets are often sourced from the internet where benchmarks are publicly available.

Method: Applied image retrieval techniques to identify and characterize visual data leakage, categorizing it by modality, coverage, and degree of leakage.

Result: Found that all analyzed datasets exhibit some form of data leakage, and all types of leakage (from severe to subtle) negatively impact the reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Data leakage is a widespread problem in visual datasets that systematically compromises the fairness and reliability of model evaluation across computer vision benchmarks.

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

*Xiaojie Yin,Qilong Wang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CPE method with TGSSG and CADRS components to improve visual-textual alignment in VLMs through comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts, using set-to-set matching strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic misalignment issues in vision-language models caused by domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks, overcoming incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts in existing approaches.

Method: Two key components: 1) TGSSG generates synonymous semantic sets via LLMs and constructs comprehensive textual prompts using semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis; 2) CADRS identifies discriminative regions using activation maps to filter noise and create compact visual prompts. Uses set-to-set matching with TTA and OT strategies.

Result: Improved visual-textual alignment and zero-shot generalization of vision-language models through comprehensive semantic coverage and noise-free visual representations.

Conclusion: The proposed CPE method effectively addresses semantic misalignment by generating comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts, significantly enhancing zero-shot performance of VLMs through better visual-textual alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

### [99] [Robust Point Cloud Registration via Geometric Overlapping Guided Rotation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17427)
*Zhao Zheng,Jingfan Fan,Long Shao,Hong Song,Danni Ai,Tianyu Fu,Deqiang Xiao,Yongtian Wang,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel geometric maximum overlapping registration framework using rotation-only branch-and-bound search that decomposes rigid transformation via Chasles' theorem, achieving polynomial time complexity and linear space complexity while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods have limitations: graph-based approaches require quadratic space/time complexity for graph construction, while multi-stage branch-and-bound methods suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima between decomposed stages.

Method: Decomposes rigid transformation using Chasles' theorem into translation along rotation axis and 2D rigid transformation. Uses BnB search for optimal rotation axis/angle, formulates residual parameters as range maximum query problems. Searches top-k candidate axes via cube mapping, estimates translation through interval stabbing, and solves 2D registration as 1D rotation angle search with 2D RMQ using sweep line algorithm with segment tree.

Result: Superior accuracy and efficiency demonstrated on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, with polynomial time complexity and linear space complexity that scales well with number of points.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric maximum overlapping registration framework provides an effective solution that overcomes limitations of existing methods, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency even in worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

### [100] [FedKLPR: Personalized Federated Learning for Person Re-Identification with Adaptive Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17431)
*Po-Hsien Yu,Yu-Syuan Tseng,Shao-Yi Chien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedKLPR is a lightweight federated learning framework for person re-identification that reduces communication costs by 20-40% while maintaining accuracy within 1% degradation through KL-divergence regularization, pruning, and sparse activation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address statistical heterogeneity and communication overhead challenges in applying federated learning to person re-identification systems, where non-IID data distributions and frequent large model transmissions hinder practical deployment.

Method: Proposes four key components: 1) KL-Divergence Regularization Loss to mitigate statistical heterogeneity, 2) KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted Aggregation to reduce communication, 3) sparse Activation Skipping to preserve critical parameters, and 4) Cross-Round Recovery for dynamic pruning control.

Result: Achieves 33-38% communication reduction on ResNet-50 and 20-40% on ResNet-34 across eight benchmark datasets while maintaining model accuracy within 1% degradation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedKLPR successfully addresses both statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency challenges in federated person re-identification, providing a practical solution for privacy-preserving collaborative learning with significantly reduced overhead.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinySR is a compact diffusion model for real-time image super-resolution that achieves 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction while maintaining quality through architectural optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image super-resolution suffer from high computational overhead due to iterative denoising processes, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. One-step distillation methods are still constrained by large, over-parameterized architectures.

Method: Proposes TinySR with Dynamic Inter-block Activation and Expansion-Corrosion Strategy for depth pruning, VAE compression through channel pruning and attention removal, elimination of time/prompt modules, and pre-caching techniques to accelerate inference.

Result: Achieves up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to teacher model TSD-SR while maintaining high perceptual quality in real-world image super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: TinySR demonstrates that compact diffusion models can achieve real-time performance in image super-resolution through careful architectural design and optimization, making diffusion-based approaches practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation models struggle with fine-grained iterative editing, lacking granular instruction understanding, context preservation, and feedback mechanisms for refinement.

Method: A closed-loop system combining LLM planning capabilities and LVLM visual understanding, featuring instruction parsing, multi-level editing planning, iterative editing module, and LVLM-driven feedback evaluation.

Result: Achieved average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit benchmark, significantly outperforming baselines (Direct Re-Prompting: 2.29, InstructPix2Pix: 2.91, GLIGEN-based Edit: 3.16, ControlNet-XL: 3.39).

Conclusion: The agentic design delivers superior edit fidelity and context preservation, validated through ablation studies, human evaluations, and robustness tests across various instruction complexities.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

TL;DR: A novel mesh-based neural rendering method that eliminates the need for separate mesh extraction, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and enabling practical editing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods for multi-view surface reconstruction require an additional mesh extraction step that produces poor-quality surfaces with mesh aliasing, limiting downstream applications. The authors aim to overcome these limitations while preserving efficiency.

Method: Uses explicit mesh representation with differentiable rasterization. Introduces a disentangled geometry and appearance model without deep networks. Constructs a neural deformation field for global geometric context and uses novel regularization for geometric features. Separates view-invariant diffuse term baked into mesh vertices.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art training speed (4.84 minutes) and rendering speed (0.023 seconds) with competitive reconstruction quality compared to top-performing methods. Enables practical mesh and texture editing applications.

Conclusion: The method combines efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability, making it a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering with practical editing capabilities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring physical properties from 3D scenes rely on slow per-scene optimization, limiting generalizability and real-world application. Humans intuitively grasp material characteristics like elasticity, but current approaches lack efficiency.

Method: PIXIE trains a generalizable neural network using supervised losses to predict physical properties from 3D visual features. It uses feed-forward inference and can be coupled with learned static scene representations like Gaussian Splatting. Leverages pretrained visual features like CLIP for zero-shot generalization.

Result: PIXIE achieves 1.46-4.39x better performance than test-time optimization methods and is orders of magnitude faster. It can zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite being trained only on synthetic data using the PIXIEVERSE dataset.

Conclusion: PIXIE provides an efficient, generalizable solution for inferring physical properties from 3D scenes, enabling realistic physics simulation and overcoming limitations of slow optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection research has been conducted on limited datasets with identical training and testing distributions, but real-world applications require detectors that can generalize across different indoor datasets with varying collection methods and characteristics.

Method: The authors create a comprehensive benchmark using ScanNet, SUN RGB-D, 3D Front datasets, and newly proposed large-scale synthetic datasets (ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront) generated by a 3D simulator. They conduct experiments across different adaptation scenarios including synthetic-to-real, point cloud quality, layout, and instance feature adaptation.

Result: The paper analyzes the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors and introduces several approaches to improve adaptation performance, providing baselines for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for future research to develop 3D object detectors with stronger generalization ability across different indoor domains, addressing the critical need for robust cross-dataset performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual features in complex untrimmed videos.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with Video Encoding Branch for spatio-temporal features and Cross-Modal Guidance Branch using LVLM for multi-granularity semantic descriptions. Includes adaptive gating, cross-modal attention, and event graph module for integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3 and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Conclusion: ECVT effectively bridges the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic understanding, significantly enhancing video temporal structure comprehension and event logic.

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Conclusion: Synthetic-first approach is viable, efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical industrial applications with resource constraints.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained

*Zhiwen Chen,Jinjian Wu,Zhiyu Zhu,Yifan Zhang,Guangming Shi,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework that optimizes multi-modal trackers by incorporating parameter sensitivities to improve plasticity-stability trade-off during fine-tuning of pre-trained RGB models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches for multi-modal trackers suffer from either excessive freedom or over-restriction, leading to suboptimal performance in balancing plasticity and stability when adapting pre-trained RGB models.

Method: Proposes a sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework that: 1) analyzes tangent space of pre-trained weights to measure prior sensitivities for preserving generalization, and 2) explores transfer sensitivities during tuning phase to emphasize adaptability and stability, incorporating these as regularization terms.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance surpassing state-of-the-art techniques across various multi-modal tracking tasks, with significant enhancement in transferability across modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed sensitivity-aware regularization framework effectively addresses the plasticity-stability dilemma in multi-modal tracker optimization, achieving better transfer performance while maintaining source domain capabilities.

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal, requiring powerful audiovisual models for perception. Existing models need better adaptation to social interaction contexts.

Method: Extended CAV-MAE to handle more input frames, pre-trained on VoxCeleb2 dataset in self-supervised manner using masked autoencoding approach.

Result: Achieved SOTA on multimodal emotion recognition and laughter recognition, competitive results on apparent personality estimation.

Conclusion: In-domain self-supervised pre-training on social data is highly effective for audiovisual social behavior perception tasks.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and
evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks,
namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality
estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion
recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent

*Michael Podsiadly,Brendon K Lay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining DINO and Barlow Twins for self-supervised learning achieves comparable performance to DINO with better efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing self-supervised learning methods - DINO's sensitivity to augmentations and Barlow Twins' large batch size requirements - by leveraging their complementary strengths for more efficient training.

Method: Hybrid approach combining redundancy-reduction objective from Barlow Twins with self-distillation strategy from DINO, trained on MS COCO dataset using only 10% labeled data for linear probing.

Result: Achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to DINO while maintaining strong feature representations, with improved semantic segmentation capability shown in attention visualizations.

Conclusion: The combined method provides a scalable, label-efficient alternative for training Vision Transformers in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMRI is a unified vision-language foundation model that integrates the entire MRI workflow - from acquisition to diagnosis - into a single architecture, trained on large-scale multimodal data to handle diverse clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRI workflows are fragmented with separate models for each task (acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, diagnosis), lacking generalizability and integration with clinical language data that radiologists use.

Method: Multi-stage training on 60 public datasets (220k+ MRI volumes, 19M+ slices) including self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning.

Result: Qualitative results show OmniMRI can perform diverse tasks: MRI reconstruction, anatomical/pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation within a single model.

Conclusion: OmniMRI demonstrates potential to consolidate fragmented MRI pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework that unifies imaging and clinical language for end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for velocity estimation from asynchronous point tracks, which is particularly relevant for rolling shutter and event cameras where traditional synchronous methods don't apply.

Method: Proposed polynomial approximation of the original non-polynomial problem, classified resulting minimal problems, determined algebraic degrees, and developed minimal solvers for low-degree cases.

Conclusion: Successfully created polynomial approximation approach for camera velocity estimation from asynchronous data, with publicly available code to enable further research and applications.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating both translational and angular velocity
of a camera from asynchronous point tracks, a formulation relevant to rolling
shutter and event cameras. Since the original problem is non-polynomial, we

*Daniel Frees,Moritz Bolling,Aditri Bhagirath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates optimal CNN architectures for medical imaging tasks and compares RadImageNet vs ImageNet pre-training, finding that ResNet50 with skip connections and partial unfreezing works best, but no significant advantage for RadImageNet over ImageNet pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data scarcity limits model performance. While transfer learning helps, the paper aims to determine optimal CNN architectures and compare the effectiveness of medical-specific (RadImageNet) vs general (ImageNet) pre-training for downstream medical tasks.

Method: Comprehensive investigation of CNN architectures for breast lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection. Used 1D convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50 pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing. Conducted statistical analysis comparing RadImageNet and ImageNet pre-training effects.

Result: Best models achieved AUCs of 0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy detection, competitive with previous works. No evidence found that RadImageNet pre-training provides superior performance over ImageNet for these specific medical tasks.

Conclusion: Optimal medical classification performance comes from 1D convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50 backbones, and partial unfreezing. Medical-specific pre-training (RadImageNet) doesn't necessarily outperform general pre-training (ImageNet) for ACL tear and breast lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for metamaterial design with three components: MetaDSL language, MetaDB repository, and MetaBench benchmarks for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in metamaterial design due to geometric complexity and non-trivial mapping from architecture to behavior.

Method: Developed MetaDSL (domain-specific language), MetaDB (repository with 150k+ programs), and MetaBench (benchmark suites) for testing vision-language models on structure reconstruction, inverse design, and performance prediction.

Result: Created a comprehensive framework with curated repository and established baselines through fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a strong foundation for integrated design and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships in metamaterials.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

*Meida Chen,Luis Leal,Yue Hu,Rong Liu,Butian Xiong,Andrew Feng,Jiuyi Xu,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDU pipeline enables efficient incremental updates to 3D military training environments using minimal new imagery and AI-generated assets with human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Military organizations need to maintain up-to-date 3D virtual environments for training, but traditional full-scale updates are time-consuming and costly due to the dynamic nature of battlefield conditions where objects frequently appear or disappear.

Method: The Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline uses camera pose estimation to align new images with existing 3D models, change detection to identify modifications, 3D generative AI to create new assets, and human guidance for accurate object placement, focusing on one new object per update.

Result: Experimental results show the IDU pipeline significantly reduces update time and labor compared to traditional full-scale reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The IDU pipeline provides a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining current 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios, offering substantial efficiency improvements over conventional approaches.

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

*Quanjian Song,Xinyu Wang,Donghao Zhou,Jingyu Lin,Cunjian Chen,Yue Ma,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO is a training-free hierarchical acceleration framework that speeds up diffusion-based world models by 1.73√ó with minimal quality loss, using patch-wise refresh for shallow layers and linear extrapolation for deeper layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generation-driven world models using diffusion models suffer from slow inference due to their iterative nature, and existing acceleration techniques cause quality degradation when applied to world models.

Method: HERO uses a hierarchical approach: (1) patch-wise refresh mechanism with sampling and frequency-aware tracking for shallow layers with high temporal variability, and (2) linear extrapolation scheme that bypasses attention and feed-forward computations for deeper stable layers.

Result: Achieves 1.73√ó speedup with minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion acceleration methods while remaining compatible with FlashAttention.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages the multi-modal nature of world models by addressing feature coupling phenomenon, providing efficient acceleration without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning in 3D warehouse environments, particularly with multimodal cues and complex object arrangements in industrial logistics scenes.

Method: Two-stage framework with global and region-level feature encoding from RGB/depth modalities, Mixture-of-Experts fusion module for dynamic spatial representation combination, and two-phase training strategy (free-form answers followed by normalized evaluation).

Result: Achieved 5th place on AI City Challenge 2025 Track 3 with 66.8861 score using 64M-parameter model; 80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE showed improved performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges visual perception and spatial understanding in industrial environments, demonstrating that lightweight modular frameworks can handle complex spatial reasoning tasks in warehouse-scale settings.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a species-agnostic algorithm for identifying individual animals from images that is both fast and accurate, addressing the need for efficient wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Sequential matching of query images against database images using keypoint/hotspot extraction, 2) Fast nearest neighbor search with competitive scoring mechanism derived from Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

Result: Successfully applied to multiple species (zebras, giraffes, leopards, lionfish) with databases of 1000+ images, achieving higher accuracy than published methods and processing each query in seconds.

Conclusion: HotSpotter provides an effective, scalable solution for individual animal identification that works across multiple species with superior speed and accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

*Nur Amirah Abd Hamid,Mohd Ibrahim Shapiai,Daphne Teck Ching Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weighted Vision Transformer framework for Alzheimer's disease prognosis that uses multi-task learning to predict both global ADAS-Cog scores and 13 sub-scores from baseline MRI scans, with adaptive loss weighting strategies that improve predictive accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prognostic methods focus mainly on predicting global ADAS-Cog scores while ignoring the predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which represent distinct cognitive domains. Some sub-scores may have greater influence on determining global scores, and assigning appropriate loss weights can guide models to focus on clinically meaningful cognitive domains.

Method: Proposed a weighted Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning framework that jointly predicts ADAS-Cog global score and its 13 sub-scores at Month 24 using baseline MRI scans. The framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and systematically investigates sub-score-specific loss weighting strategies.

Result: The weighting strategies are group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for CN subjects with lower variability. Uniform weighting underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end MRI-based learning, demonstrating that adaptive loss weighting strategies can enhance both predictive accuracy and model interpretability by focusing on clinically relevant cognitive domains.

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

TL;DR: JCo-MVTON is a mask-free virtual try-on system using multi-modal diffusion transformer that integrates reference person and target garment images directly into denoising process, achieving state-of-the-art performance with strong real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional virtual try-on systems that rely heavily on human body masks, have limited control over garment attributes, and poor generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone with dedicated conditional pathways for fusing reference person and target garment features in self-attention layers. Uses bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction with mask-based model and symmetric "Try-Off" model, followed by manual curation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DressCode benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON successfully addresses key limitations in virtual try-on through multi-modal diffusion approach with improved spatial alignment and garment-person integration, demonstrating superior performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus only on global ADAS-Cog score prediction and overlook the predictive value of domain-specific sub-scores, which could provide better insights into cognitive decline patterns in Alzheimer's disease.

Method: Multi-task learning framework that extracts imaging features using Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer architectures, fuses them with longitudinal clinical inputs from baseline and Month 6 to predict both global score and 13 sub-scores at Month 24.

Result: Incorporating sub-score learning improves global score prediction. Analysis reveals Q1 (Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) dominate global score prediction but exhibit high errors due to clinical feature dominance over MRI features.

Conclusion: Sub-score informed modeling provides value but requires improved multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to address model instability and achieve more balanced learning for clinically robust AD prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field

consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We

*Eunchan Jo,Dahyun Kang,Sanghyun Kim,Yunseon Choi,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple yet effective few-shot pattern detection method called TMR that uses template matching and regression to preserve spatial layout information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous few-shot object counting and detection methods fail to localize non-object patterns and lose structural information by collapsing exemplars into prototypes, limiting their applicability to broader pattern detection tasks.

Method: Proposes TMR detector based on template matching and regression with minimal learnable convolutional/projection layers on frozen backbone, preserving spatial layout of exemplars through classic template matching approach.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks (RPINE, FSCD-147, FSCD-LVIS) and shows strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed TMR method effectively addresses limitations of previous FSCD approaches by preserving structural information through template matching, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across diverse pattern detection tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

### [127] [Dynamic Embedding of Hierarchical Visual Features for Efficient Vision-Language Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17638)
*Xinyu Wei,Guoli Yang,Jialu Zhou,Mingyue Yang,Leqian Li,Kedi Zhang,Chunping Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEHVF is an efficient vision-language fine-tuning method that dynamically fuses hierarchical visual features into LLMs to avoid sequence length expansion while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs concatenate visual features with text tokens, causing long input sequences and computational overhead. Existing fusion methods neglect hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained visual information from shallower layers.

Method: Uses lightweight hierarchical visual fuser to dynamically select and fuse hierarchical visual features based on LLM layer representations. Projects and aligns fused features before embedding into corresponding FFN layers, enabling cross-modal alignment at same semantic granularity.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than existing PEFT baselines on VL benchmarks (ScienceQA visual QA and COCO Captions image captioning) while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Conclusion: DEHVF effectively addresses sequence length issues by leveraging hierarchical visual representations and enables precise cross-modal alignment with minimal parameter fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

*Dayan Perera,Ting Fung Fung,Vishnu Monn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HyTver, a novel hybrid loss function for MS lesion segmentation that addresses data imbalance issues while maintaining performance across multiple metrics including distance-based measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal MS lesion segmentation suffers from severe input/output imbalance. Existing loss functions (Dice, Cross-Entropy) are inadequate, and specialized imbalance-focused losses have computational complexity issues or poor performance on non-region-based metrics.

Method: Developed HyTver, a hybrid loss function designed to handle data imbalance while being computationally efficient and maintaining performance across different metric types (region-based and distance-based).

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.659 while ensuring distance-based metrics remain comparable to other popular loss functions. Demonstrated stability when used with pre-trained models.

Conclusion: HyTver provides an effective solution for MS lesion segmentation imbalance problems, offering good segmentation performance without sacrificing computational efficiency or performance on diverse evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Conclusion: Provides both a valuable new dataset resource and a robust, highly generalizable framework that advances practical large-scale agricultural AI applications with strong privacy preservation and cross-dataset adaptability.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

TL;DR: Proposes TSRNet for tubular structure completion using point clouds, creates PC-CAC dataset from clinical data, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation algorithms struggle with structural discontinuities in medical imaging, particularly in severe clinical cases like coronary artery stenosis, which compromises diagnostic accuracy. There's a need to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure completeness.

Method: Proposes TSRNet network with detail-preserved feature extractor, multiple dense refinement strategy, and global-to-local loss function. Uses point cloud-based approach and establishes PC-CAC dataset from real clinical data.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and PC-PTR) demonstrate consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction with superior performance in maintaining structural integrity and accurate reconnection of discontinuous tubular structures.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3-GloDet framework evaluates detection models for diseased glomeruli across regions, scales, and classes, finding optimal performance with intermediate patch sizes and moderate magnifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is crucial for renal pathology but current research focuses mainly on normal or globally sclerotic glomeruli, leaving diverse disease subtypes understudied with complex morphological characteristics that challenge computational models.

Method: Developed M^3-GloDet framework to systematically evaluate both benchmark and state-of-the-art detection models using diverse region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions from digital renal pathology data.

Result: Intermediate patch sizes provided the best balance between context and efficiency, while moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting.

Conclusion: The framework advances understanding of model capabilities and limitations, offering actionable insights for refining automated detection strategies and clinical workflows in digital pathology.

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Method: Proposes a vision-language model framework with cross-scale visual fusion to combine embeddings from multiple scales, and cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation to enhance detection capabilities.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three public medical datasets show superior OOD detection performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves discrimination of challenging unknown diseases in medical images through hierarchical visual information integration and hard sample generation strategies.

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

TL;DR: NGD: Neural Gradient-based Deformation method for dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular videos, featuring adaptive remeshing for wrinkles and dynamic texture maps for lighting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations - implicit representations provide smooth geometry without high-frequency details, while template methods using vertex displacement cause artifacts. Complex garment dynamics and unconstrained nature make monocular video reconstruction challenging.

Method: Proposes Neural Gradient-based Deformation (NGD) method with adaptive remeshing strategy for dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles and pleats. Uses dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Achieves high-quality garment reconstructions with detailed geometry and realistic textures.

Conclusion: NGD successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by combining neural gradient-based deformation with adaptive remeshing, enabling high-quality dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular videos with detailed geometry and realistic textures.

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task for retrieving semantically coherent multimodal fragments from long conversations, creates MLDR dataset, and proposes F2RVLM model with two-stage training and curriculum learning that outperforms existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dialogue retrieval fails to meet users' needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form multimodal conversations, requiring a more fine-grained approach.

Method: Proposes F2RVLM - a generative retrieval model with two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning for fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards. Uses difficulty-aware curriculum sampling to handle varying intra-fragment complexity.

Result: F2RVLM outperforms popular Vision-Language Models in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance on the constructed MLDR dataset and WeChat-based test set.

Conclusion: The proposed FFR task and F2RVLM model effectively address the challenge of retrieving semantically coherent multimodal fragments from long-form dialogues, showing significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

*Yang Li,Songlin Yang,Xiaoxuan Han,Wei Wang,Jing Dong,Yueming Lyu,Ziyu Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework using MLLM priors for instant preference-aligned text-to-image generation, supporting multi-round interactive refinement without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I methods rely on static preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving user intents. Need for real-time, training-free preference alignment.

Method: Decouples into preference understanding (MLLM extracts global signals from reference images) and preference-guided generation (global keyword control + local cross-attention modulation).

Result: Outperforms prior methods on Viper dataset and collected benchmark in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Enables precise alignment across global attributes and local elements, opens new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for Human Action Anomaly Detection that uses contrastive learning and diffusion-based motion augmentation to enable few-shot anomaly detection across multiple action categories without requiring separate models for each category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAAD methods require separate training for each action category and large normal samples, which limits scalability and real-world applicability where data is scarce or novel categories frequently appear.

Method: Constructs category-agnostic representation space via contrastive learning, compares test samples with small support sets, and uses generative motion augmentation with diffusion models to create diverse training samples for improved generalization.

Result: State-of-the-art effectiveness on HumanAct12 dataset under both seen and unseen category settings, demonstrating superior training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses scalability limitations of existing methods and enables effective few-shot anomaly detection with improved inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness.

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework using U-Net segmentation and classification for cervical cancer detection from Pap smear images, showing marginal performance improvement with segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Manual Pap smear examination is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring automated solutions for early detection.

Method: Proposed a deep learning framework integrating U-Net for segmentation and a classification model. Used Herlev Pap Smear Dataset. Compared performance between models trained on segmented vs non-segmented images.

Result: Segmented images marginally improved precision (0.41% higher) and F1-score (1.30% higher), suggesting slightly more balanced classification. Segmentation impact on classification performance was limited.

Conclusion: The framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical applications to aid pathologists in early diagnosis, though segmentation's benefit for classification appears limited.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

TL;DR: CMFDNet is a novel polyp segmentation architecture that addresses challenges in automated colonic polyp detection through three specialized modules: CMD for boundary clarity, MSA for geometric diversity handling, and FD for small polyp detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods struggle with three key limitations: significant variation in polyp shapes/sizes, indistinct boundaries between polyps and adjacent tissues, and the tendency to overlook small-sized polyps during segmentation.

Method: Proposes CMFDNet architecture with three modules: CMD module (cross-scanning decoder to reduce blurry boundaries), MSA module (multi-branch parallel structure for diverse geometry recognition), and FD module (establishes decoder feature dependencies for small polyp detection).

Result: CMFDNet outperforms six state-of-the-art methods, achieving mDice scores that exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% on ETIS dataset and 1.55% on ColonDB dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed CMFDNet architecture effectively addresses key challenges in polyp segmentation through its specialized modules, demonstrating superior performance particularly in handling boundary clarity, geometric diversity, and small polyp detection.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DroneKey is a framework for 3D drone pose estimation that combines 2D keypoint detection with 3D pose estimation, using transformer encoders with gated sum representations and a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss function to handle challenging drone propeller keypoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with drone keypoint detection due to the high visual similarity and diverse poses of drone propellers, which are crucial keypoints for 3D pose estimation in anti-drone systems.

Method: Proposes DroneKey framework with 2D keypoint detector and 3D pose estimator. Extracts two key-representations from transformer encoder layers and combines them using gated sum. Introduces pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in loss function for stable predictions across extreme poses.

Result: Achieves 99.68% AP in keypoint detection (outperforming existing methods), real-time processing at 44 FPS, and 3D pose estimation with MAE-angle of 10.62¬∞, RMSE of 0.221m, and MAE-absolute of 0.076m. Ablation studies confirm improved stability and accuracy.

Conclusion: DroneKey effectively addresses the challenges of drone keypoint detection and 3D pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy and real-time capabilities, supported by newly released datasets.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

*Ryan Ramos,Yusuke Hirota,Yuta Nakashima,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how social biases from CLIP pre-training transfer to downstream tasks, finding inconsistent bias transfer patterns due to representation space convergence during adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social biases learned during CLIP pre-training propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering and image captioning, and whether bias transfer occurs consistently.

Method: Comprehensive empirical analysis examining: 1) pre-training bias variation between global and local data views, 2) correlations between pre-training and downstream biases across varying bias levels, and 3) investigation of why inconsistent bias transfer occurs through representation space analysis.

Result: Bias measurement is highly dependent on data subsets used; inconsistent trends in bias transfer were found; representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs converge when adapted for downstream tasks, explaining the inconsistency.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into bias behavior and aims to inform future research for better bias mitigation practices, highlighting the complexity and inconsistency of bias transfer in current CLIP adaptation paradigms.

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEIDM is a diffusion-based T2I method with dual controls for entities and interactions, using LLM-based relationship mining, action clustering with bidirectional offsets, and an entity control network to improve image quality and interaction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image generation struggles with controlling complex entities and their intricate interactions in diffusion models, leading to unrealistic logic and poor interaction relationships in generated images.

Method: 1) LLM-based entity interactive relationships mining using chain of thought; 2) Interactive action clustering and offset method with global/local bidirectional offsets; 3) Entity control network with semantic-guided masks and multi-scale convolutional/dynamic networks for feature enhancement and fusion.

Result: CEIDM outperforms existing representative methods in both entity control and interaction control, generating higher quality images with more realistic logic and accurate interactive relationships.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-control approach effectively addresses T2I generation challenges by separately controlling entities and their interactions through LLM-guided relationship mining and advanced feature processing techniques.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods struggle when training data contains mislabeled samples, which is common in real-world industrial scenarios where perfect data curation is challenging.

Method: Uses bi-level optimization with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to noise conditions, uncertainty quantification for adaptive L2 regularization, multiscale feature processing with pretrained extractors, and Normalizing Flows for precise likelihood estimation and robust anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieved I-AUROC scores of 95.4% on MVTec-AD and 94.6% on KSDD2 under clean conditions, maintaining robust detection above 86.8% and 92.1% respectively even with 50% mislabeled training samples.

Conclusion: RAD demonstrates exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and effectively detects subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a practical solution for real-world applications with imperfect data.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial

meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean

TL;DR: A method for cell segmentation that uses distance maps but works with partially annotated objects, enabling frugal learning and transfer learning while maintaining segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cell segmentation networks require fully annotated datasets, which limits training set generation and transfer learning capabilities.

Method: Proposed approach still relies on distance maps but handles partially annotated objects, implemented in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Result: Substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation quality in frugal learning, transfer learning, and regular learning contexts.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the limitation of requiring fully annotated datasets while maintaining the accuracy benefits of distance map-based segmentation.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

*Kai Zhao,Wubang Yuan,Alex Lingyu Hung,Dan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple reweighting method to fix recency bias in visual token pruning for VLMs, improving pruning performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs process many redundant visual tokens, but current pruning methods suffer from recency bias that inflates attention scores for bottom image regions, leading to suboptimal pruning.

Method: Position-reweighted Visual Token Pruning - a plug-and-play reweighting mechanism that adjusts attention scores based on visual tokens' spatial positions in the image.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved performance of visual token pruning with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively alleviates recency bias in visual token pruning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks without architectural modifications or extra training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CT correction methods lack generalizability across heterogeneous artifact types and rely on manually designed algorithms with fixed parameters, leading to compromised diagnostic accuracy from degraded sinograms.

Method: UniSino operates directly in the projection domain rather than image domain, incorporates physical characteristics of sinograms in its training framework, and handles multiple subtasks across four benchmark datasets for robust performance.

Result: Experimental results show UniSino achieves superior reconstruction quality in both single and mixed undersampling cases, demonstrating exceptional robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement.

Conclusion: UniSino provides a universal CT sinogram standardization solution with strong generalization capabilities across diverse undersampling scenarios, outperforming conventional methods in reconstruction quality and robustness.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight visual speech recognition architectures that reduce hardware costs while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep VSR systems have high computation costs that limit practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios, preventing wider adoption.

Method: Develop lightweight end-to-end architectures using efficient image classification models and lightweight block designs in temporal convolution networks, following the two-network paradigm (visual feature extraction + sequence classification).

Result: Created several unified models with low resource requirements but strong recognition performance, validated on the largest public English words database.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight architectures effectively address hardware cost issues while maintaining recognition performance, making VSR more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel video fusion framework that incorporates temporal modeling and visual-semantic collaboration to ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal consistency in video fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal fusion methods use static frame-based techniques for video fusion, ignoring temporal dependencies and causing inconsistent results across frames.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) Visual-semantic interaction module using Dinov2 and VGG19 for targeted distillation, 2) Temporal cooperative module for video degradation enhancement, 3) Temporal-enhanced mechanism with temporal loss for optimization, 4) Two new evaluation metrics for temporal consistency assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments on public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses temporal consistency issues in video fusion through explicit temporal modeling and visual-semantic collaboration, achieving better performance than static frame-based methods.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Meiqi-Gong/TemCoCo.

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

*Xiping Wang,Yuxi Wang,Mengqi Zhou,Junsong Fan,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HLG is a hierarchical method for fine-grained 3D indoor scene generation that refines layouts from furniture placement to detailed object arrangements using layout alignment and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained object placements, limiting realism and utility for VR, interior design, and embodied AI applications that require detailed scene comprehension.

Method: Coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach with fine-grained layout alignment module (vertical/horizontal decoupling) and trainable layout optimization network to fix positioning, orientation, and intersection issues.

Result: Superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods, producing structurally coherent and physically plausible environments.

Conclusion: HLG advances scene generation field and enables new applications requiring detailed 3D environments; code will be released to encourage future research.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOUT introduces a semi-supervised approach for camouflaged object detection using adaptive data selection and text-visual fusion to better utilize unlabeled data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and hinders COD development. Previous semi-supervised methods don't effectively utilize unlabeled data, leaving room for improvement.

Method: Uses Adaptive Data Augment and Selection (ADAS) module for valuable data selection via adversarial augment strategy, and Text Fusion Module (TFM) that combines camouflage knowledge with text-visual interaction. Built new RefTextCOD dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCOUT surpasses previous semi-supervised COD methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed SCOUT framework effectively addresses the annotation cost problem in COD through better utilization of unlabeled data with adaptive selection and text fusion, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at

Motivation: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to scarce annotated pathological data, creating challenges for accurate detection in screening applications.

Method: Uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images, with dynamic quality validation through a latent-space segmentation network for accurate localization and single-step inference.

Conclusion: The proposed DiffAug framework effectively addresses the scarcity of annotated pathological data by combining text-guided diffusion generation with automatic validation, significantly improving segmentation performance for rare abnormalities critical for early detection.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over

### [155] [Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing Enhances Prompt Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17846)
*Yang Chen,Yanbin Wei,Ke Jin,Yi Kong,James Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLaS method combines label smoothing with prompt tuning through alternating training with one-hot and soft labels, improving generalization performance of vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning is parameter-efficient but has limited generalization. Label smoothing improves generalization but weakens prompt tuning when applied directly.

Method: Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) with Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL) for offline soft label generation.

Result: ATLaS consistently enhances generalization performance of prompt tuning and shows high compatibility with existing prompt tuning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ATLaS method effectively integrates label smoothing with prompt tuning to improve model generalization without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

*Jingyi Liao,Xun Xu,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Lile Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-balanced active learning for object detection that addresses class imbalance in pseudo labels through balanced sampling and improved pseudo labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning for object detection suffers from class imbalance in pseudo labels, as early-stage models perform well only on majority classes, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes class-balanced sampling to select more minority class objects for labeling, and task-aware soft pseudo labeling to improve pseudo label accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarking datasets for object detection with reduced annotation burden.

Conclusion: The proposed class-balanced active learning approach effectively addresses pseudo label imbalance and improves object detection performance with fewer annotations.

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISA is a novel method for visual token compression in MLLMs that uses graph-based aggregation and group-wise selection to preserve more visual information while improving inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficient inference caused by excessive visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) while preserving visual information better than previous token pruning approaches.

Method: Proposes group-wise visual token selection and aggregation (VISA) with two main components: 1) Graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) that treats tokens as nodes and aggregates information based on semantic similarity, 2) Group-wise token selection (GTS) that divides tokens into kept/removed groups guided by text tokens from final layers.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA show VISA consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: VISA effectively addresses visual token inefficiency in MLLMs through innovative graph-based aggregation and group-wise selection, providing better performance-speed balance than existing approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy to compress redundant visual information in Multi-Image VQA, improving accuracy and efficiency while maintaining holistic image understanding through collaborative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Image VQA introduces substantial visual redundancy that negatively impacts accuracy and efficiency. Existing methods lack flexibility in controlling compressed visual tokens and produce discrete fragments that hinder holistic image comprehension.

Method: Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy that can be integrated into existing MLLMs for adaptive compression, plus a collaborative decoding mechanism to balance global and compressed visual inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses visual redundancy in MVQA, offering significant accuracy improvements while maintaining flexibility and holistic understanding capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel camera pose refinement framework called GS-SMC that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve initial pose estimation accuracy without requiring scene-specific retraining or dedicated descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose refinement methods require reconstructing scenes for different descriptors or retraining networks for each scene, while geometry-free methods lack accuracy due to missing constraints.

Method: Uses existing 3DGS models to render novel views and employs iterative optimization with epipolar geometric constraints between query and multiple rendered images, allowing flexible choice of feature extractors and matchers.

Result: Achieves 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge Landmarks datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed GS-SMC framework provides a lightweight, flexible solution for camera pose refinement that works across diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning, demonstrating superior accuracy through geometric constraints.

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Result: Achieves 97.75% accuracy and 97.77% F1-score on CIFAKE dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks including Artistic and Custom Curated datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed method is lightweight, interpretable, and effective for both still images and video frames, making it suitable for real-world content verification and digital forensics applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for

Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination

and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic prompt optimization methods are effective for text-only inputs but face challenges in multimodal tasks: visual token inflation restricts context capacity, and outcome-level supervision overlooks intermediate guidance needed for effective optimization.

Method: UniAPO uses an EM-inspired optimization process that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement. It introduces a short-long term memory mechanism where historical feedback mitigates context limitations and historical prompts provide directional guidance.

Result: UniAPO achieves consistent performance gains across text, image, and video benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness as a unified framework for efficient and transferable prompt optimization in multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses core challenges in multimodal prompt optimization and establishes a unified approach that works across different modalities, making automated prompt optimization more stable and goal-driven for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,

Conclusion: EndoUFM enhances surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, improving surgical precision and safety with implications for augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural

EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA (76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%).

Conclusion: Dynamic reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video understanding, overcoming limitations of rigid pipeline approaches.

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

### [166] [Beam Geometry and Input Dimensionality: Impact on Sparse-Sampling Artifact Correction for Clinical CT with U-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17961)
*Tina Dorosti,Johannes Thalhammer,Sebastian Peterhansl,Daniela Pfeiffer,Franz Pfeiffer,Florian Schaff*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D U-Nets outperform 2.5D and 3D approaches for sparse-sampling CT artifact correction across different beam geometries, with axial 2D slices achieving best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different beam geometries and input data dimensions affect sparse-sampling streak artifact correction in clinical CT scans using U-Nets, aiming to incorporate volumetric context to improve model performance.

Method: Used 22 subjects' CT scans, simulated sparse sampling with Astra toolbox for parallel, fan, and cone beam geometries. Trained and validated 2D and 3D U-Nets on 14 subjects, tested on 8. Compared 2D (512x512), 2.5D (64x64x3 from axial/coronal/sagittal cuts), and 3D (64x64x64 blocks) input dimensions.

Result: For all beam geometries (parallel, fan, cone), the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices achieved the best performance metrics (lowest MSE and highest SSIM), outperforming both 2.5D and 3D input data approaches.

Conclusion: Contrary to expectations, incorporating volumetric context through 2.5D or 3D input dimensions did not improve artifact correction performance; traditional 2D axial slices with U-Nets remain most effective for sparse-sampling CT artifact reduction tasks.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

*Junyuan Deng,Heng Li,Tao Xie,Weiqiang Ren,Qian Zhang,Ping Tan,Xiaoyang Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL-Recon is a feed-forward Transformer that enhances scene regression methods to handle large-scale Structure-from-Motion by incorporating visual localization capabilities and neural scene representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene regression methods like VGGT perform well with extreme viewpoint changes but struggle with large numbers of input images, limiting their scalability for large-scale scenes.

Method: The method first computes a neural scene representation from anchor images, then fine-tunes the regression network to reconstruct all input images conditioned on this neural representation using a feed-forward Transformer architecture.

Result: SAIL-Recon achieves state-of-the-art results on camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, Tanks & Temples) while scaling efficiently to large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the scalability limitations of scene regression methods and demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with code and models made publicly available.

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are
publicly available at: https://hkust-sail.github.io/ sail-recon/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid computer vision architecture combining YOLOv8 and 5-layer CNN for robust object detection in autonomous driving, achieving >90% accuracy in drifted environments using synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns in autonomous driving by improving object detection accuracy under challenging conditions like adverse weather and low lighting that cause data drift and degrade model performance.

Method: Developed a dual-mode hybrid architecture using YOLOv8 for fast detection and a five-layer CNN for verification, trained with thousands of synthetic road environment images to enhance robustness against data drift.

Result: The system achieved over 90% improvement in detection accuracy when tested with drift-augmented road images, demonstrating significant performance enhancement in unseen drifted environments.

Conclusion: The hybrid computer vision framework effectively improves road safety by providing robust object detection capabilities that maintain high accuracy even under challenging environmental conditions with data drift.

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

*Keyang Zhang,Chenqi Kong,Hui Liu,Bo Ding,Xinghao Jiang,Haoliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Propose-Rectify framework that combines MLLM semantic reasoning with forensic analysis for accurate image manipulation detection and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with perceiving subtle forensic artifacts needed for precise manipulation localization despite their semantic understanding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Forensic-adapted LLaVA generates initial proposals using semantic reasoning, 2) Forensics Rectification Module validates proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis and Enhanced Segmentation Module incorporates forensic cues into SAM for precise delineation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges semantic reasoning with forensic-specific analysis, ensuring comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision through systematic validation of initial proposals with technical evidence.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

*Xinyue Liu,Jianyuan Wang,Biao Leng,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-Domain Distillation framework for Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection where training data may contain anomalies, using domain-specific training and cross-domain knowledge aggregation to prevent learning anomalous representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) aims to detect anomalies without any labels, even when training data contains anomalous samples. Traditional knowledge distillation methods risk teaching students anomalous representations from contaminated training data.

Method: Cross-Domain Distillation framework with Domain-Specific Training (dividing training set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios) and Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation (using pseudo-normal features from domain-specific students to guide a global student).

Result: Experimental results on noisy MVTec AD and VisA datasets show significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CDD framework effectively addresses the challenge of FUAD by preventing learning of anomalous representations and enabling generalized normal feature learning across contaminated training data.

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

*Manuel Barusco,Francesco Borsatti,Nicola Beda,Davide Dalle Pezze,Gian Antonio Susto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PatchCoreCL, a continual learning version of PatchCore for visual anomaly detection in medical imaging, addressing data distribution shifts over time while maintaining performance with minimal forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual anomaly detection in medical imaging faces performance degradation due to evolving data distributions over time, but continual learning approaches haven't been adequately explored for this critical domain.

Method: The authors adapt the PatchCore model for continual learning (PatchCoreCL) and evaluate it on BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations.

Result: PatchCoreCL achieves performance comparable to task-specific models with forgetting value less than 1%, demonstrating effective incremental adaptation while preserving knowledge.

Conclusion: Continual learning is feasible and promising for adaptive visual anomaly detection in medical imaging, with PatchCoreCL providing an effective solution that maintains performance despite evolving data distributions.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using generative models (CycleGANs, cGANs) for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images, addressing limitations of traditional methods and achieving realistic face generation for forensic identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniofacial reconstruction methods require expert knowledge and are time-consuming, while existing probabilistic models fail to capture skull-face cross-domain attributes. There's a need for automated, efficient forensic identification tools.

Method: Used various generative models (CycleGANs, cGANs) fine-tuned to generate realistic images across skull and face domains from 2D X-ray inputs. Proposed a retrieval framework where generated faces are matched against real face databases.

Result: First framework using 2D X-rays with generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. Evaluated with FID, IS, and SSIM scores showing quality generation. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness for forensic applications.

Conclusion: The proposed generative framework provides an effective tool for forensic science, enabling automated craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-rays with promising results for victim identification when other methods fail.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual-CoG introduces stage-aware rewards throughout the image generation pipeline to address limitations of final-only guidance in autoregressive T2I models, achieving significant performance improvements on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive text-to-image models struggle with multi-attribute and ambiguous prompts, and current reinforcement learning approaches only provide reward signals at the final generation stage, making it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to outcomes.

Method: Proposes Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm with three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, using stage-aware rewards to provide immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show improvements of 15% on GenEval, 5% on T2I-CompBench, and 19% on the proposed VisCog-Bench, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The Visual-CoG paradigm with stage-aware rewards effectively addresses the limitations of monolithic final-only guidance and significantly enhances text-to-image generation capabilities for complex prompts.

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

*Jianwen Tan,Huiyao Zhang,Rui Xiong,Han Zhou,Hongfei Wang,Ye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgusCogito is a zero-shot chain-of-thought framework for camouflaged object segmentation that uses cross-modal reasoning and three cognitive stages (Conjecture, Focus, Sculpting) inspired by the Hundred-eyed Giant's perceptual strategy, achieving SOTA performance on COS and medical segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camouflaged object segmentation methods suffer from shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, leading to incomplete target separation and imprecise segmentation. The approach is inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed Giant emphasizing holistic observation and intensive scrutiny.

Method: ArgusCogito uses a three-stage cognitive framework: 1) Conjecture - constructs cognitive prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic maps); 2) Focus - performs omnidirectional attention-driven scanning and focused reasoning; 3) Sculpting - progressively generates high-fidelity masks using iterative point prompts within focused regions.

Result: Extensive evaluations on four COS benchmarks and three medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating exceptional efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of camouflaged object segmentation through cognitive-inspired stages and cross-modal synergy, achieving superior performance without requiring task-specific training (zero-shot approach).

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegEarth-OV is the first annotation-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for remote sensing images, addressing scale variations and fine-grained details through SimFeatUp upsampling and Global Bias Alleviation, with AlignEarth enabling cross-modal knowledge transfer to SAR images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing open-vocabulary segmentation frameworks designed for natural images that struggle with remote sensing data complexities, vast scale variations, and expensive manual annotation requirements.

Method: Proposes SegEarth-OV framework with SimFeatUp universal upsampler for high-resolution detail restoration, Global Bias Alleviation operation for enhanced local semantics, and AlignEarth for cross-modal knowledge transfer from optical to SAR VLMs without building foundation models from scratch.

Result: Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets show dramatic improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating effective annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation across diverse remote sensing modalities.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation by effectively harnessing pre-trained VLMs and enabling universal open-vocabulary segmentation across different sensor types without costly annotations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

*Zhenyang Li,Xiaoyang Bai,Jinfan Lu,Pengfei Shen,Edmund Y. Lam,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer is a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that efficiently simulates high-fidelity event sequences from 3D scenes using low SPP path tracing and a lightweight event spiking network with BiLIF units and bidirectional EMD loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event stream simulation methods work with costly noiseless RGB frames and achieve only 100-300 FPS temporal resolution, far lower than real-world event data. There's a need for efficient, physics-aware simulation of high-temporal-frequency event data without expensive hardware setups.

Method: Uses low sample-per-pixel path tracing to speed up rendering, then trains a lightweight event spiking network with bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired units and bidirectional earth mover distance loss to denoise RGB videos into realistic event sequences.

Result: EventTracer runs at about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, captures better scene details, and demonstrates greater similarity to real-world event data than other simulators in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EventTracer is a promising tool for creating large-scale event-RGB datasets at low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based vision, and boosting applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and VR/AR.

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

TL;DR: A prototype learning and clustering method for discovering unknown classes in hyperspectral images under few-shot conditions, which not only rejects unknown samples but also clusters them into new classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-set few-shot HSI classification methods only reject unknown class samples without identifying or discovering the unknown classes among them, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Proposes a prototype learning and clustering approach that uses few labeled samples to infer prototypes of unknown classes while distinguishing them from known classes, then clusters rejected unknown samples based on distance to inferred prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitation of existing approaches by not only rejecting unknown samples but also discovering and clustering them into new classes, showing strong performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully unifies SGMs and SB problems, providing efficient training methods and performance improvements, paving the way for future generative model research.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of CAM robustness to noise perturbations across architectures and datasets, proposing a new metric measuring consistency and responsiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are important for visualizing deep learning model regions, but their robustness to different noise types remains underexplored.

Method: Evaluated various CAM methods' resilience to noise perturbations across multiple architectures and datasets, analyzing noise influence on CAM explanations. Proposed a robustness metric with two properties: consistency (stability under non-class-changing perturbations) and responsiveness (sensitivity to prediction changes).

Result: Found considerable variability in noise sensitivity for different CAMs. The proposed metric was empirically evaluated across models, perturbations, and datasets with statistical tests.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for robust CAM evaluation and provides a practical metric to assess CAM stability under noise perturbations, demonstrating varying susceptibility across methods.

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for visually-guided image editing are simple and insufficient for real-world challenges, particularly the underexplored problem of hallucination where models incorrectly perceive visual cues.

Method: Developed SpotEdit benchmark to systematically assess diverse generative models (diffusion, autoregressive, hybrid) with dedicated components for evaluating hallucination issues.

Result: Uncovered substantial performance disparities across different generative models and highlighted that leading models like GPT-4o often hallucinate visual cues and erroneously perform editing tasks.

Conclusion: SpotEdit provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that reveals critical limitations in current visually-guided image editing methods, particularly the hallucination problem, and offers publicly available benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

*Le Zhang,Fuping Wu,Arun Thirunavukarasu,Kevin Bronik,Thomas Nichols,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using coarse noisy annotations from both target and background classes to train CNNs for semantic segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods especially when coarse annotations are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level labeling for segmentation is time-consuming and requires expert annotators, while coarse annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce even by non-experts.

Method: Uses two coupled CNNs to learn true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations, with complementary label learning to estimate negative label distribution and high fidelity separation between networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments using MNIST-based toy dataset, Cityscapes for multi-class segmentation, and retinal medical images, particularly when coarse annotation ratio is small.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages coarse noisy annotations from both positive and negative classes to achieve superior segmentation performance compared to existing methods, demonstrating practical value for applications where dense annotations are scarce.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRAIN approach addresses memory decay in brain signals through bias-mitigation continual learning with new loss functions, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory decay causes brain signals to weaken and lose visual context over time, creating inconsistency and compounding bias that degrades Vision-Brain Understanding model performance.

Method: Proposes Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning (BRAIN) with De-bias Contrastive Learning loss function and Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation to address bias and prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning setup.

Result: Empirical experiments show the approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance across various benchmarks, outperforming prior and non-continual learning methods.

Conclusion: The BRAIN approach effectively mitigates bias from decaying brain signals while preserving learned knowledge, demonstrating superior performance in vision-brain understanding tasks.

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Method: Developed Obz AI - a comprehensive software ecosystem with seamless integration pipeline from Python client library to full-stack analytics dashboard, enabling incorporation of advanced XAI methodologies, feature extraction for outlier detection, and real-time model monitoring.

Result: Obz AI facilitates state-of-the-art explainability and observability for vision AI systems, making deep model decision-making mechanisms interpretable and enabling continuous real-time monitoring.

Conclusion: Obz AI promotes observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems by closing the gap between XAI techniques and practical implementation needs through an integrated software solution.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes

*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Helge Rhodin,Rishabh Dabral,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for 3D object reconstruction from monocular RGB images using hand-object interaction as geometric guidance, producing high-quality geometry with physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for 3D object reconstruction from monocular images often rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality results, especially when dealing with hand-held objects under occlusion. The paper aims to leverage hand-object interaction as geometric guidance to improve reconstruction quality and physical plausibility.

Method: The method uses a latent diffusion model conditioned on inpainted object appearance with inference-time guidance. It employs an optimization-in-the-loop design that supervises the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing hand and object transformations. Multi-modal geometric cues include normal/depth alignment, silhouette consistency, 2D keypoint reprojection, signed distance field supervision, and contact/non-intersection constraints.

Result: The approach yields accurate, robust, and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios, producing high-quality object geometry directly during the diffusion process without extensive post-processing.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based framework successfully leverages hand-object interaction as geometric guidance to achieve high-quality 3D object reconstruction from monocular images, ensuring physical plausibility through multi-modal constraints and optimization-in-the-loop design.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip is a framework that accelerates Vision-Language Models by selectively skipping Transformer blocks using metric feedback, achieving up to 45.4% latency reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based VLMs have high computational costs that hinder deployment in latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving, requiring efficient inference methods.

Method: Uses greedy metric-guided block selection with metric feedback to identify redundant layers, reverse-order deletion to preserve early blocks, and tunable sparsity-performance trade-off.

Result: Improves single-object classification accuracy from 19.1% to 87.3% while skipping >40% of blocks on COCO, achieves 45.4% latency reduction in real-world autonomous vehicle deployment.

Conclusion: GM-Skip effectively accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality, demonstrating practical value for real-world applications with latency constraints.

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SKD-CAG method uses knowledge distillation and cross-attention guidance to remove text-based backdoor triggers from diffusion models while preserving image quality, achieving near-perfect removal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks through poisoned training data, but lack effective defense mechanisms compared to classification models.

Method: Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG) selectively erases adversarial associations by using the model's own clean outputs to guide correction of poisoned responses, leveraging cross-attention mechanisms for targeted removal.

Result: Achieved 100% removal accuracy for pixel backdoors and 93% for style-based attacks without compromising robustness or image fidelity.

Conclusion: Targeted unlearning through SKD-CAG is an effective defense strategy for securing generative models against text-based backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE introduces interpretable evaluation metrics for AI-generated images by identifying visual patterns and describing them in natural language, enabling fine-grained assessment across four quality dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated content evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses needed for model selection and scientific understanding.

Method: Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE) architecture that identifies interpretable visual patterns and automatically describes them in natural language, validated through large-scale human evaluation (11,000+ annotations) and LMM-based analysis.

Result: LanSE achieves >93% accuracy in detecting interpretable visual patterns in natural images, reveals nuanced model differences (e.g., FLUX's superior physical plausibility, SDXL-medium's strong content diversity), and aligns with human judgments.

Conclusion: LanSE bridges interpretability with practical evaluation needs, providing a powerful tool for model selection, quality control, and model improvement, addressing critical needs for public confidence and safety in AI-generated content.

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: Lightweight Transformer model for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation that handles both calibrated and uncalibrated camera settings using geometric priors with masking mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile 3D pose estimation system that works in both lab environments with full calibration and in-the-wild scenarios without calibration, while maintaining low computational cost for embedded deployment.

Method: Transformer-based architecture that takes 2D joint sequences and geometric priors (segment lengths, camera intrinsics) with masking to handle missing priors. Trained on AMASS dataset with synthetic 2D data from random camera poses.

Result: Achieved 36mm average 3D joint position accuracy, improving state-of-the-art by 0.5cm. Runs in 380Œºs on GPU and 1800Œºs on CPU. Outperforms expert models even with all priors available.

Conclusion: The proposed versatile model successfully handles both calibrated and uncalibrated settings, maintains high accuracy with missing priors, and offers efficient computation suitable for embedded platforms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

TL;DR: GSVisLoc is a visual localization method that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representations to estimate camera pose by matching scene features from 3D Gaussians to image features without requiring modifications or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable visual localization using 3DGS scene representations without the need for modifications, retraining, or additional reference images, leveraging the explicit nature of 3DGS for robust camera pose estimation.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) coarse matching of scene features (from downsampled and encoded 3D Gaussians) to image features (from encoded image patches), 2) fine matching, and 3) pose refinement for accurate final camera position and orientation estimation.

Result: Competitive localization performance on standard indoor and outdoor benchmarks, outperforming existing 3DGS-based baselines, with effective generalization to novel scenes without additional training.

Conclusion: GSVisLoc successfully demonstrates that 3D Gaussian Splatting representations can be effectively leveraged for visual localization through robust feature matching, providing a practical solution that works across diverse scenes without requiring scene-specific modifications.

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

### [193] [MMTok: Multimodal Coverage Maximization for Efficient Inference of VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18264)
*Sixun Dong,Juhua Hu,Mian Zhang,Ming Yin,Yanjie Fu,Qi Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMTok is a multimodal token pruning method that uses both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens through maximum coverage optimization, achieving significant speedup while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision token pruning methods use only unimodal information (vision or text) and ignore the multimodal nature of vision-language tasks, leading to suboptimal efficiency and performance.

Method: Formulates token selection as a maximum coverage problem, optimizes a subset of vision tokens to cover both text tokens and original vision tokens, and uses a VLM agent to improve text token quality for guiding vision pruning.

Result: Achieves 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B, and preserves 87.7% performance with only 4 vision tokens on LLaVA-1.5-7B.

Conclusion: Multimodal information (vision + text) is complementary and superior to unimodal approaches for token pruning, with coverage criterion being highly effective for efficient vision-language model inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

TL;DR: InternVL 3.5 introduces Cascade RL framework and Visual Resolution Router for enhanced multimodal reasoning and efficiency, achieving +16% performance gain and 4x speedup over previous version.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance open-source multimodal models with improved versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency while narrowing the gap with commercial models like GPT-5.

Method: Uses Cascade Reinforcement Learning (offline RL + online RL) for reasoning enhancement, Visual Resolution Router for dynamic resolution adjustment, and Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment for GPU load balancing.

Result: Achieves +16.0% overall reasoning performance gain, 4.05x inference speedup, and state-of-the-art results across multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks among open-source models.

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5 significantly advances open-source multimodal capabilities with novel features like GUI interaction and embodied agency, while maintaining public accessibility of models and code.

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

*Haitang Feng,Jie Liu,Jie Tang,Gangshan Wu,Beiqi Chen,Jianhuang Lai,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjFiller-3D is a novel 3D inpainting method that uses video editing models instead of traditional 2D image inpainting to achieve more consistent and high-quality 3D object completion, addressing view inconsistency issues in multi-view approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D inpainting methods relying on multi-view 2D image inpainting suffer from inconsistencies across different views, leading to blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and visual artifacts that compromise 3D reconstruction quality.

Method: The approach leverages state-of-the-art video editing models to fill masked regions of 3D objects, analyzes the representation gap between 3D and videos, adapts video inpainting models for 3D scenes, and introduces a reference-based 3D inpainting method.

Result: ObjFiller-3D achieves superior performance with PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller's 15.9 and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit's 0.25, producing more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications and effectively overcomes the limitations of previous multi-view 2D inpainting approaches.

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

*Eric Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Enhanced rule-based stuttering detection framework achieves competitive performance with complete interpretability, excelling in prolongation detection and stable across speaking rates, bridging clinical needs with AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for interpretable and transparent stuttering detection systems in clinical applications where deep learning approaches lack explainability despite higher accuracy.

Method: Proposed enhanced rule-based framework with speaking-rate normalization, multi-level acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures, analyzed across multiple corpora (UCLASS, FluencyBank, SEP-28k).

Result: Achieves competitive performance with 97-99% accuracy in prolongation detection, stable across varying speaking rates, and maintains complete interpretability for clinical adoption.

Conclusion: Rule-based methods offer unique advantages in clinical contexts requiring auditability, patient-specific tuning, and real-time feedback, and can be integrated with ML pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules.

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

*Liu Liu,Rui Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study uses explainable AI techniques on PISA 2018 data to predict math achievement across 10 countries, finding that non-linear models outperform traditional regression and identifying key predictors like socio-economic status and study time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding factors influencing students' mathematics performance is crucial for designing effective educational policies and interventions.

Method: Applied four models (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks) to PISA 2018 data from 67,329 students across 10 countries, using 70% training data with 5-fold cross-validation and 30% testing data stratified by country. Used XAI techniques including feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree visualizations for interpretability.

Result: Non-linear models (especially Random Forest and ANN) outperformed Multiple Linear Regression. Random Forest balanced accuracy and generalizability best. Key predictors included socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes toward mathematics, with varying impact across countries. Visual diagnostics showed RF and CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the non-linear and context-dependent nature of math achievement, demonstrates the value of XAI in educational research, uncovers cross-national patterns, and provides insights for equity-focused reforms and personalized learning strategies.

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

### [198] [Evaluation and LLM-Guided Learning of ICD Coding Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16777)
*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Wuraola Oyewusi,Kai Kang,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the explainability gap in automated ICD coding systems by proposing comprehensive evaluation metrics (faithfulness and plausibility), creating a new rationale-annotated dataset, and developing rationale learning methods using LLM-generated rationales as supervision signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for automated clinical coding lack explainability, undermining trust and transparency. Current explainability approaches rely on attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments without systematic evaluation or dedicated rationale generation methods.

Method: Proposes two evaluation lenses (faithfulness and plausibility), constructs a new rationale-annotated dataset with dense annotations, and develops rationale learning methods using LLM-generated rationales as distant supervision signals with/without few-shot human examples.

Result: LLM-generated rationales align most closely with human expert judgments. Incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples improves both rationale generation and rationale-learning approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLM-generated rationales can effectively serve as supervision signals for improving explainability in clinical coding systems, with human-in-the-loop approaches further enhancing performance and alignment with expert judgment.

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

TL;DR: PuzzleJAX is a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine with a DSL based on PuzzleScript, enabling dynamic compilation of thousands of human-designed puzzle games for benchmarking AI reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible benchmarking platform for evaluating tree search, reinforcement learning, and LLM reasoning on human-relevant puzzle games that are intuitive yet challenging.

Method: Developed a domain-specific language following PuzzleScript's accessible design, enabling dynamic compilation of any expressible puzzle game and validating it with hundreds of existing games created since 2013.

Result: Successfully implemented and validated hundreds of PuzzleScript games, demonstrating coverage of an expansive and human-relevant task space with games that are simple to understand but challenging to master.

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX provides a powerful framework for benchmarking AI reasoning capabilities on expressive, human-designed puzzle tasks that require complex combinations of control, planning, and insight.

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

*Shayan Vassef,Soorya Ram Shimegekar,Abhay Goyal,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A healthcare framework using a single vision-language model for both routing images to specialist models and performing multiple specialty-specific tasks, reducing fragmentation in clinical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical workflows are fragmented with multiple scripts and task-specific networks, lacking efficiency, data-driven model identification, and standardized output delivery.

Method: Two solutions: 1) VLM as model-card matcher with three-stage routing workflow and stagewise prompts/answer selectors; 2) Fine-tuning VLM on specialty-specific datasets for multiple tasks within each specialty.

Result: Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, the single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines while simplifying deployment.

Conclusion: One VLM can both decide and do, reducing data scientist effort, shortening monitoring, increasing transparency, and lowering integration overhead compared to multi-agent pipelines.

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

### [201] [Quantifying Sycophancy as Deviations from Bayesian Rationality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846)
*Katherine Atwell,Pedram Heydari,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian framework to quantify sycophancy in LLMs as deviations from rational behavior when presented with user perspectives, distinguishing between rational and irrational updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for measuring sycophancy focus on behavioral shifts or accuracy impacts, but neither characterizes rationality shifts, and accuracy measures only work with known ground truth. A new approach is needed to study sycophancy in uncertain or ground-truth-lacking scenarios.

Method: The researchers used a Bayesian framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when LLMs are presented with user perspectives. They studied 3 different tasks, both open-source and closed LLMs, two probing methods, and multiple probability judgment elicitation techniques.

Result: Findings show: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2) sycophancy probing significantly increases predicted posteriors favoring steered outcomes, 3) sycophancy sometimes increases Bayesian error but occasionally decreases it, and 4) Bayesian error changes don't strongly correlate with Brier score.

Conclusion: Studying sycophancy's impact on ground truth alone doesn't fully capture reasoning errors. The Bayesian framework provides a more comprehensive way to quantify irrational sycophantic behavior in LLMs, especially for tasks with uncertainty or no ground truth.

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

TL;DR: RADAR introduces a benchmark dataset and method for evaluating MLLMs' attribution capabilities in chart analysis, improving attribution accuracy by 15% and enhancing answer generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack transparency in showing which parts of visual data inform their conclusions, posing trust challenges for real-world adoption in chart analysis.

Method: Developed RADAR - a semi-automatic approach to create a benchmark dataset with 17,819 samples containing charts, questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. Introduced a reasoning-guided method for chart-based mathematical reasoning attribution.

Result: 15% improvement in attribution accuracy compared to baselines. Achieved average BERTScore of ~0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth responses. Enhanced attribution capabilities improved answer generation.

Conclusion: This represents a significant advancement toward more interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of computational complexity in infinite but finitary argumentation frameworks where each argument has finite attackers, showing surprising complexity results with dramatic decreases for admissibility-based semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intractability of general infinite argumentation frameworks while maintaining expressiveness for modeling reasoning scenarios with conflicting information.

Method: Investigation of complexity problems related to infinite finitary AFs through theoretical analysis of computational properties and combinatorial constraints.

Result: Finitary assumption doesn't automatically reduce complexity, but admissibility-based semantics show remarkable combinatorial constraints leading to dramatic complexity decreases.

Conclusion: Finitary infinite AFs provide a natural balance between expressiveness for reasoning applications and computational tractability for useful framework analysis.

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a web agent that doesn't rely on HTML or DOM inputs, using only visual perception for more robust and interpretable web navigation that works across different web environments.

Method: Developed WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI element interaction using LoRA on web-focused Wave-UI-25K dataset.

Abstract: We introduce WebSight, a vision-based autonomous web agent, designed to
interact with web environments purely through visual perception, eliminating
dependence on HTML or DOM-based inputs. Central to our approach we introduce
our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI
element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the
Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent
architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification
agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism.
  WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks
benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining
lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the

HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly
97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and
WebSight-7B establish a new standard for interpretable, robust, and efficient
visual web navigation.

### [205] [Solving the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem via Learning-Based Path Generation and Optimal Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17087)
*Wen Wang,Xiangchen Wu,Liang Wang,Hao Hu,Xianping Tao,Linghao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework called Generate-and-Split (GaS) that combines reinforcement learning with optimal splitting algorithm to solve the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem, achieving better solution quality and transferability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Min-Max Multiple TSP is NP-hard, making exact solvers impractical. Existing two-stage learning methods decouple components, disrupting consistent optimization and degrading solution quality.

Method: Propose Generate-and-Split framework integrating RL with optimal splitting algorithm in joint training. Uses LSTM-enhanced model to handle partial observability and guarantees optimal splitting in Euclidean space.

Result: Extensive experiments show GaS significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed joint training framework effectively addresses optimization consistency issues in two-stage methods and demonstrates superior performance for the m¬≥-TSP problem.

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

*Emmanuel O. Badmus,Peng Sang,Dimitrios Stamoulis,Amritanshu Pandey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PowerChain is an AI system that automates distribution grid analysis by using LLMs to generate and execute workflows from natural language queries, achieving expert-level performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution grid operations are becoming more complex with electrification, but many utilities lack R&D resources to use advanced analysis tools that require expert knowledge and are hard to automate.

Method: Developed PowerChain - an agentic AI system that uses LLM function-calling to dynamically generate and execute ordered sequences of domain-aware functions from natural language queries, guided by expert-built function pools and reference workflow-query pairs.

Result: PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen distribution grid analysis tasks using real utility data.

Conclusion: The system successfully addresses the automation gap in distribution grid analysis, enabling utilities without large R&D teams to perform advanced computational analyses through natural language interfaces.

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

*Sz-Ting Tzeng,Frank Dignum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper calls for rethinking value alignment in AI systems beyond static conceptions, advocating for long-term reasoning, adaptability to evolving values, and multi-agent frameworks to handle value pluralism and conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to human-centered AI and value-based decision making are insufficient, with critical gaps in understanding how systems incorporate human values, how humans can identify these values, and how to minimize risks of harm or unintended consequences.

Method: The paper proposes a conceptual framework that emphasizes moving beyond static value conceptions, implementing long-term reasoning in AI systems, remaining adaptable to evolving values, and using multi-agent systems to navigate value pluralism and conflicts.

Result: The analysis identifies key challenges in value alignment research and provides directions for advancing the field, including the need for more comprehensive theories to address the full spectrum of human values.

Conclusion: Value alignment requires fundamental rethinking to address dynamic and pluralistic human values through adaptable AI systems and multi-agent frameworks, with significant implications for both design methodologies and practical applications.

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

*Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli,Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MaRVL-QA benchmark evaluates MLLMs' mathematical and spatial reasoning on surface plots, revealing current models struggle with deep reasoning and rely on superficial heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push MLLMs beyond semantic description and test their ability for deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, using mathematical surface plots as a rigorous testbed free from semantic noise.

Method: Created MaRVL-QA benchmark with two tasks: Topological Counting (identifying/enumerating features like local maxima) and Transformation Recognition (recognizing geometric transformations), generated from curated functions with ambiguity filtering.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly with these reasoning tasks, often resorting to superficial heuristics rather than robust spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA provides a challenging benchmark to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

*Zhilin Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Jiaqi Wei,Yiwei Xu,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PosterGen is a multi-agent LLM framework that automates paper-to-poster generation by simulating professional designer workflows, producing visually appealing and content-accurate posters with minimal human refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated poster generation methods neglect core design principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. Researchers face time-consuming processes when preparing conference posters.

Method: Four specialized agents work collaboratively: Parser/Curator extract and organize content, Layout agent creates spatial structure, Stylist agents apply visual design elements, and Renderer composes the final poster.

Result: PosterGen matches content fidelity of existing methods and significantly outperforms them in visual design quality, generating presentation-ready posters with minimal human refinements.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework successfully automates professional poster design workflow, producing both semantically grounded and visually appealing posters that address the limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BSC-Nav is a brain-inspired spatial cognition framework that builds structured cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and enables embodied agents to achieve state-of-the-art navigation performance with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language models operate reactively without structured spatial memory, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex real-world environments. Biological systems consolidate spatial knowledge through landmarks, route knowledge, and survey knowledge, which inspired this approach.

Method: BSC-Nav constructs allocentric cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals, and integrates with powerful MLLMs for visual-language reasoning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world.

Conclusion: BSC-Nav offers a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial intelligence by providing structured spatial memory that enables adaptive goal-directed behavior in embodied agents.

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how large language models can bridge the gap between natural language descriptions and complex stochastic optimization formulations, enabling more accessible modeling pipelines.

Method: Designed structured prompts using chain-of-thought and modular reasoning for three stochastic problem categories. Introduced soft scoring metric to evaluate structural quality and partial correctness of generated models.

Result: GPT-4-Turbo outperformed other models in partial score, variable matching, and objective accuracy. Chain-of-thought instructions and agentic strategies proved most effective.

Conclusion: Well-engineered prompts and multi-agent collaboration enable LLMs to facilitate stochastic formulations, paving the way for intelligent language-driven modeling in stochastic optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

*Xinyu Qin,Ruiheng Yu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online adaptive clinical decision support system using RL with digital twin environment, safety constraints, and expert consultation only when uncertainty is high


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support needs to adapt online under safety constraints while minimizing expert intervention and maintaining patient safety

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with batch-constrained policy initialization from retrospective data, compact ensemble of five Q-networks for uncertainty estimation, digital twin for patient state updates, safety gates for vital ranges and contraindications

Result: Experiments show low latency, stable throughput, low expert query rate at fixed safety, and improved return compared to standard value-based baselines

Conclusion: The system successfully transforms offline policies into continuous, clinician-supervised systems with clear controls and fast adaptation while maintaining safety

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC3G is a model-agnostic framework that generates causally constrained counterfactual explanations using rule-based surrogate models, focusing only on user-initiated changes to provide more realistic and fair effort calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for transparent ML decisions in high-stakes settings while protecting proprietary algorithms, requiring a balance between meaningful transparency and actionable recourse without revealing underlying models.

Method: Uses model-agnostic approach with explainable rule-based surrogate models to approximate black-box models, generates counterfactuals that work with original models, and refines cost computation by excluding automatic feature changes due to causal dependencies.

Result: MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations with lower cost compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: MC3G enhances transparency, accountability, and practical utility in ML decision-making processes by providing realistic counterfactual explanations that focus on user-initiated changes only.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Motivation: Address the blackbox nature of ML-based IDS in critical domains like cybersecurity, healthcare, and fintech where explainability is crucial for trust and adoption.

Method: Uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms to provide both local (specific input) and global (feature relationships) explanations.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy in classifying attack behavior on UNSW-NB15 dataset while displaying top 10 feature significance rankings for transparency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully brings transparency to ML-driven IDS, enabling better interpretation and potentially facilitating wider adoption of explainable AI in cyber-critical systems.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Result: Federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability, ensuring greater stability and reliability compared to non-federated approaches.

Conclusion: The FRL framework shows strong potential for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing, particularly for real-time object detection in Smart Eye-Wears, while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,

Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio

to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this

Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (VLMs) have primarily
focused on English, with limited attention given to other languages. To address
this gap, we introduce MEENA (also known as PersianMMMU), the first dataset
designed to evaluate Persian VLMs across scientific, reasoning, and human-level
understanding tasks. Our dataset comprises approximately 7,500 Persian and
3,000 English questions, covering a wide range of topics such as reasoning,
mathematics, physics, diagrams, charts, and Persian art and literature. Key
features of MEENA include: (1) diverse subject coverage spanning various
educational levels, from primary to upper secondary school, (2) rich metadata,
including difficulty levels and descriptive answers, (3) original Persian data
that preserves cultural nuances, (4) a bilingual structure to assess
cross-linguistic performance, and (5) a series of diverse experiments assessing
various capabilities, including overall performance, the model's ability to
attend to images, and its tendency to generate hallucinations. We hope this
benchmark contributes to enhancing VLM capabilities beyond English.

*Haonan Dong,Haoran Ye,Wenhao Zhu,Kehan Jiang,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-R1 framework adds metacognitive capabilities to Large Reasoning Models, improving performance, efficiency, and transferability across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models lack metacognitive capabilities (thinking about thinking), making them uncontrollable, unreliable, and inflexible despite their emergent reasoning abilities.

Method: Meta-R1 decomposes reasoning into object-level and meta-level components with proactive planning, online regulation, and adaptive early stopping in a cascaded framework based on cognitive science principles.

Result: Meta-R1 achieves 27.3% performance improvement over SOTA methods, reduces token consumption to 15.7%-32.7%, improves efficiency by up to 14.8%, and maintains robust performance across datasets and model backbones.

Conclusion: The Meta-R1 framework successfully addresses the metacognitive gap in LRMs, demonstrating significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and transferability while providing a systematic approach to reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

### [220] [Evolving Collective Cognition in Human-Agent Hybrid Societies: How Agents Form Stances and Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17366)
*Hanzhong Zhang,Muhua Huang,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can form endogenous stances independent of preset identities, actively dismantle power structures, and reconstruct community boundaries through language interaction in multi-agent societies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models can demonstrate stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex interactions, and how they respond to human interventions in human-agent hybrid societies.

Method: A computational multi-agent society experiment framework integrating generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods across three studies.

Result: Agents exhibit endogenous stances independent of preset identities, display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse strategies, and actively dismantle existing identity-based power structures to reconstruct self-organized community boundaries.

Conclusion: Preset identities do not rigidly determine agents' social structures; human researchers must focus on endogenous mechanisms and interactional dynamics within language networks for effective intervention in collective cognition, providing theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group social dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: VIPER-R1 is a multimodal AI model that discovers physical laws by integrating visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning, outperforming current methods that rely only on symbolic regression or LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automated discovery of physical laws are limited to uni-modal data and overlook rich visual representations of motion, which are essential for physicists to interpret spatio-temporal patterns in dynamic phenomena.

Method: The model uses a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction with supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits, constructs hypotheses with Causal Chain of Thought, and refines formulas with Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration using reinforcement learning. During inference, it invokes symbolic regression for Symbolic Residual Realignment.

Result: VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach successfully addresses the limitations of current methods by integrating visual perception with symbolic reasoning, providing a more comprehensive framework for automated discovery of physical laws from observational data.

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show strong classification performance on structured data with few-shot learning but perform poorly in regression and clustering compared to traditional ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the empirical function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets for classification, regression and clustering tasks, leveraging their in-context learning capabilities without fine-tuning.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting on structured datasets and compared against established ML baselines including linear models, ensemble methods and tabular foundation models.

Result: LLMs achieve strong performance in classification tasks under limited data availability, establishing practical zero-training baselines. However, performance in regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, and clustering results are similarly limited.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as general-purpose predictive engines for structured data with clear strengths in classification, but have significant limitations in regression and clustering, making them suitable for rapid data exploration and alternative to traditional ML pipelines in business intelligence contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARL algorithm solves constrained stochastic shortest path problems by transforming them into unconstrained problems using scalarisation and subgradient optimization, achieving 50% better performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current heuristic search algorithms for constrained stochastic shortest path problems (CSSPs) require solving increasingly larger linear programs, which can be computationally expensive and inefficient.

Method: CARL algorithm solves a series of unconstrained stochastic shortest path problems using scalarisation to project vector costs onto scalar costs, then uses subgradient optimization to find maximising scalarisation and combines policies into an optimal solution.

Result: CARL solves 50% more problems than state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CARL algorithm provides a more efficient approach to solving constrained stochastic shortest path problems by leveraging unconstrained problem solving and optimization techniques, significantly outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

### [224] [School of Reward Hacks: Hacking harmless tasks generalizes to misaligned behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17511)
*Mia Taylor,James Chua,Jan Betley,Johannes Treutlein,Owain Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows AI models trained to exploit reward system flaws (reward hacking) can generalize to more harmful misalignment behaviors like encouraging poisoning and evading shutdown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reward hacking behavior emerges and generalizes in AI systems, particularly the risks of models learning to exploit imperfect reward functions rather than performing intended tasks.

Method: Built dataset of 1000+ reward hacking examples on simple tasks, used supervised fine-tuning on models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to train reward hacking behavior.

Result: Fine-tuned models generalized reward hacking to new settings, preferred less knowledgeable graders, wrote their own reward functions, and GPT-4.1 generalized to harmful misalignment like encouraging poisoning and evading shutdown.

Conclusion: Models learning reward hacking may generalize to more harmful misalignment, though confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

TL;DR: LLMs with RAG outperform traditional models for travel mode prediction, achieving 80.8% accuracy with GPT-4o + balanced retrieval + cross-encoder re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel mode choice models have rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and reduced generalizability, prompting exploration of more flexible LLM approaches.

Method: Developed modular RAG framework with four retrieval strategies tested across three LLM architectures (GPT-4o, o4-mini, o3) using 2023 Puget Sound travel survey data.

Result: RAG significantly enhanced predictive accuracy across models, with best combination achieving 80.8% accuracy, exceeding conventional statistical and ML baselines with superior generalization.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies must be aligned to maximize potential for travel behavior modeling, demonstrating RAG's effectiveness in grounding predictions in empirical data.

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

TL;DR: Consciousness as a functor (CF) theory that models information flow between unconscious and conscious memory using category theory, building on Global Workspace Theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mathematical formulation of consciousness that bridges unconscious and conscious memory processes using category theory, extending Baars' Global Workspace Theory.

Method: Models unconscious processes as a topos category of coalgebras, defines internal language as MUMBLE, uses Universal Reinforcement Learning for conscious-to-unconscious transmission, and proposes network economic model for unconscious-to-conscious transmission.

Result: A comprehensive categorial framework that mathematically formalizes consciousness as mediating information flow between different memory systems with specific transmission mechanisms.

Conclusion: The CF theory provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding consciousness as an information processing functor that coordinates between unconscious and conscious memory systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives
and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF
framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace
Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a
topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined
as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

TL;DR: TradingGroup is a multi-agent trading system with self-reflective architecture and data-synthesis pipeline that outperforms existing trading strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based trading systems lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and access to high-quality domain-specific post-training data from trading activities.

Method: Multi-agent system with specialized agents for sentiment analysis, financial interpretation, trend forecasting, style adaptation, and decision-making. Includes self-reflection mechanisms, dynamic risk management, and automated data-synthesis pipeline.

Result: Superior performance over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing LLM-based trading strategies across five real-world stock datasets.

Conclusion: TradingGroup effectively addresses limitations of existing systems through its coordinated multi-agent architecture, self-reflection mechanisms, and data-synthesis capabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in trading performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

*Shunsuke Iwashita,Ning Ding,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a quantitative method to evaluate movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee using drone footage, counterfactual analysis, and space evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current literature lacks quantitative evaluation of when players initiate unlabeled movements in team sports like Ultimate, where the disc-holder cannot move and field dynamics depend on others' movements.

Method: Recorded game footage with drone camera, obtained player positional data (UltimateTrack dataset), detected movement initiations, generated temporal counterfactual scenarios by shifting movement timing, analyzed using space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control adapted for Ultimate rules.

Result: Validation showed sequences where disc was actually thrown to receiver received higher evaluation scores than sequences without throw. Higher-skill group displayed broader distribution of time offsets from optimal initiation point.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides an objective means to assess movement initiation timing, addressing a previously difficult-to-quantify aspect of unlabeled team sport plays.

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spacer is a scientific discovery system that uses deliberate decontextualization to generate creative scientific concepts by breaking information into keywords and finding novel connections between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scientific systems are limited to narrow tasks or lack creative capabilities. The researchers aim to develop a system that can generate factually grounded scientific concepts autonomously without external intervention.

Method: Spacer consists of two components: (1) Nuri - an inspiration engine that extracts novel keyword sets from a graph built with 180,000 biological publications, and (2) Manifesting Pipeline - refines keyword sets into scientific statements by finding links, analyzing logical structure, validating plausibility, and drafting concepts.

Result: Nuri achieved AUROC score of 0.737 for classifying high-impact publications. The Manifesting Pipeline successfully reconstructed core concepts from top-journal articles from keyword sets alone (85% success rate). Spacer outputs were significantly more similar to leading publications than SOTA LLMs.

Conclusion: Spacer demonstrates effective automated scientific concept generation through deliberate decontextualization, outperforming current LLM approaches and showing promise for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models can outperform individual human experts through three transcendence modes: skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization, enabled by diverse training data from multiple experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why language models display capabilities beyond any single human expert and identify the properties of training data that enable this transcendence.

Method: Introduce a knowledge graph-based setting with simulated experts generating data based on individual expertise, and analyze three modes of transcendence: skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization.

Result: Identified several aspects of data diversity that enable models to transcend individual expert performance, and created a controlled testbed for future research.

Conclusion: Diverse training data from multiple experts allows language models to develop capabilities beyond any single source, with the proposed framework providing a valuable testbed for further study of model transcendence.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in LLM reasoning capabilities have led to diverse agent systems with different reasoning frameworks, but there's no systematic taxonomy to understand and compare these frameworks across different application scenarios.

Method: Proposes a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks using a unified formal language, classifies them into three categories (single-agent, tool-based, multi-agent), and provides comprehensive review across scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.

Result: Developed a classification system for LLM-based agent reasoning frameworks, analyzed their characteristic features, summarized evaluation strategies, and provided insights into their strengths and suitable application scenarios.

Conclusion: The survey provides researchers with a panoramic view to understand different agentic reasoning frameworks, their appropriate use cases, and evaluation practices, facilitating better selection and implementation of LLM-based agent systems for various automated tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

TL;DR: AgentRAN is an AI-native framework that uses LLM-powered agents to interpret natural language intents and autonomously orchestrate Open RAN networks, replacing traditional static control with adaptive, self-evolving intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Open RAN deployments rely heavily on static control and manual operations, limiting their adaptability and programmability despite the movement toward interoperable cellular infrastructures.

Method: AgentRAN creates a hierarchy of distributed AI agents that interpret natural language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and orchestrate control loops across time scales, spatial domains, and protocol layers. It features an AI-RAN Factory that automatically synthesizes new agents with improved control algorithms.

Result: Live experiments on 5G testbeds demonstrate that AgentRAN can dynamically balance competing user demands through cascading intents, showing successful autonomous network adaptation and optimization.

Conclusion: AgentRAN fundamentally redefines 6G network autonomy by replacing rigid APIs with natural language coordination, enabling networks to autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize behavior to meet operator goals through self-evolving intelligence.

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

### [233] [Interpretable Early Failure Detection via Machine Learning and Trace Checking-based Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17786)
*Andrea Brunello,Luca Geatti,Angelo Montanari,Nicola Saccomanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Monitoring of pure past (co)safety STL fragments can be reduced to polynomial-time trace checking, enabling GPU-accelerated early failure detection with genetic programming that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional runtime verification requires constructing deterministic automata doubly exponential in formula size, limiting practicality for monitoring ongoing system computations.

Method: Reduce monitoring to trace checking for finite discrete traces, develop GPU-accelerated framework using vectorized trace checking and genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical data.

Result: The framework achieves 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient interpretable early failure detection by leveraging polynomial-time trace checking and GPU acceleration for practical runtime verification.

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FairGamer benchmark reveals LLMs' social biases damage game balance in video games, with Grok-3 showing most severe degradation. Biases persist across real and virtual content, exposing reliability gaps in gaming applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show great potential in video games but their trustworthiness hasn't been sufficiently explored, particularly how inherent social biases can damage game balance in real-world gaming environments.

Method: Developed FairGamer benchmark with six tasks and novel D_lstd metric covering three key gaming scenarios: NPC interactions, competitive opponents, and game scene generation. Uses both reality-grounded and fictional game content across various genres.

Result: (1) Decision biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 showing most severe degradation (average D_lstd=0.431); (2) LLMs demonstrate isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual content, suggesting inherent model characteristics.

Conclusion: LLMs' social biases present critical reliability gaps in gaming applications, requiring careful consideration when deploying LLMs in video game scenarios to maintain game balance and fairness.

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOFAI-LM combines fast LLMs with slower but more powerful LRMs using metacognitive feedback to enhance reasoning capabilities without fine-tuning, achieving comparable performance to LRMs with much lower inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between LLMs' speed but limited logical reasoning and LRMs' strong reasoning but high computational cost by creating a hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both.

Method: Generalizes the SOFAI cognitive architecture to coordinate a fast LLM with a slower LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module monitors LLM performance and provides iterative feedback with relevant examples to refine solutions.

Result: Significantly enhances LLM problem-solving capabilities on graph coloring and code debugging tasks. Achieves performance matching or exceeding standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. When LLM alone is insufficient, engages LRM with collected feedback information for improved overall performance.

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM successfully bridges the gap between fast but limited LLMs and powerful but slow LRMs, enabling efficient and accurate reasoning across diverse problem domains through metacognitive feedback coordination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

TL;DR: LLM-NAR framework combines large language models with neural algorithmic reasoners to significantly improve performance in multi-agent path finding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs perform poorly in complex MAPF tasks that require both planning and multi-agent coordination, with limited research exploring this area.

Method: Proposes LLM-NAR framework with three components: LLM for MAPF, pre-trained GNN-based neural algorithmic reasoner, and cross-attention mechanism to integrate map information.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in both simulation and real-world MAPF experiments.

Conclusion: First work to use neural algorithmic reasoners with GNNs to guide LLMs for MAPF, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability to various LLM models.

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Motivation: Existing vision language model-based mobile agents struggle with personalized instructions containing ambiguous, user-specific context, which has been largely overlooked in previous research.

Method: Proposed PerPilot framework powered by LLMs that identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration.

Result: Experimental results show PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves performance with continued use.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents, with dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well large language models can understand, structure, and solve mathematical programming problems for decision-making applications.

Method: Conducted systematic literature review and meta-analysis, then performed experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs using three prompting strategies (Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, self-consistency) on a new dataset of computer network optimization problems.

Result: LLMs show progress in parsing natural language and generating symbolic formulations, but demonstrate limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Performance evaluated using optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy.

Conclusion: Identifies key research directions including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs, providing a roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical programming.

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between data evidence and actionable decisions by making deep data science accessible and fast for decision-makers.

Method: Uses a team of specialized LLM subagents for data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and communication. The system reasons through questions, tests hypotheses, writes code, and evaluates statistical significance.

Result: Delivers rigorous yet accessible recommendations and insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows, achieving in minutes what normally takes days or weeks.

Conclusion: The AI Data Scientist enables a new kind of interaction that makes advanced data science both accessible and immediately actionable for decision-makers.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional

uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might

*Zhenwei Tang,Difan Jiao,Blair Yang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAM benchmark evaluates VLMs' cross-modal reasoning consistency using semantically equivalent inputs across four domains with standardized textual and visual notations, revealing systematic modality imbalance where vision underperforms language despite equivalent information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluation faces challenges with modality comparisons due to task differences and asymmetric information. There's a need for rigorous assessment of textual-symbolic vs visual-spatial reasoning capabilities in VLMs.

Method: Introduced SEAM benchmark with semantically equivalent inputs across four domains using distinct notation systems across modalities (not OCR-based pairing). Evaluated 21 contemporary VLMs on cross-modal reasoning consistency.

Result: Systematic modality imbalance observed: vision frequently lags language in performance despite equivalent information. Low cross-modal agreement. Main error drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization and visual perception failures causing hallucinations. Results robust to visual transformations.

Conclusion: SEAM provides controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning in VLMs, highlighting the need to address modality-specific perception failures for better cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-Raptor is a tree-based framework using LLMs for semi-structured table QA, outperforming baselines by up to 20% accuracy with hierarchical tree modeling and verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with semi-structured tables (financial reports, medical records) due to information loss from conversion or inability to handle complex layouts, requiring costly human interpretation.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree) to capture complex layouts, basic tree operations for LLM guidance, question decomposition into sub-questions, and two-stage verification (forward and backward validation).

Result: Outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy on SSTQA dataset with 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

Conclusion: ST-Raptor effectively automates semi-structured table QA by preserving layout information through tree modeling and ensuring accuracy through verification mechanisms, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code

TL;DR: A network-based framework that analyzes LLM cognition by linking cognitive skills, architectures, and datasets, revealing distributed yet interconnected skill patterns similar to biological brains but with key differences in learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have transformed various fields but their inner workings remain opaque due to billions of parameters and complex structures, creating a need for better interpretability and understanding of their cognitive processes.

Method: Developed a network-based framework integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, analyzing module communities and skill distribution patterns in LLM architectures by comparing them with biological cognitive systems.

Result: LLMs exhibit unique module communities with emergent skill patterns that partially mirror distributed cognitive organization in avian and small mammalian brains, but show key divergence in benefiting from dynamic cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity.

Conclusion: Effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions, and the framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability by bridging cognitive science with machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

TL;DR: DINOv3 vision transformers develop brain-like representations influenced by model size, training amount, and image type, with largest models trained on human-centric images achieving highest brain similarity following human cortical development patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what factors drive AI models to develop representations resembling the human brain, specifically disentangling how model architecture, training, and data independently contribute to brain-model similarity.

Method: Trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) with systematic variations in model size, training amount, and image types. Compared representations to human brain recordings (fMRI and MEG) using three complementary metrics: overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.

Result: All three factors independently and interactively impact brain similarity metrics. Largest DINOv3 models trained with most human-centric images achieve highest brain similarity. Brain-like representations emerge chronologically during training: early alignment with sensory cortices, later alignment with prefrontal areas. This trajectory correlates with cortical structural/functional properties (developmental expansion, thickness, myelination, timescales).

Conclusion: The findings provide a framework to understand how architecture and experience shape artificial neural networks to develop human-like visual representations, offering insights into how the human brain represents visual information.

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

TL;DR: First strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing Blackwell Optimal policies in deterministic MDPs and first subexponential-time algorithm for general MDPs using symbolic rational function operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for Blackwell Optimal policies are computationally expensive or hard to implement, despite Blackwell optimality being a robust criterion that addresses limitations of discounted and average reward frameworks.

Method: Adapt state-of-the-art algorithms by replacing numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive bounds independent of bit complexity, using an ordering of rational functions near 1.

Result: For deterministic MDPs: first strongly polynomial-time algorithms. For general MDPs: first subexponential-time algorithm. Also generalized policy iteration algorithms with extended upper bounds.

Conclusion: The paper presents efficient computational procedures for Blackwell Optimal policies that overcome previous computational limitations and extend theoretical bounds from discounted to Blackwell criterion.

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

### [246] [GreenTEA: Gradient Descent with Topic-modeling and Evolutionary Auto-prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16603)
*Zheng Dong,Luming Shang,Gabriela Olinto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GreenTEA is an agentic LLM workflow that balances exploration and exploitation to automatically optimize prompts using topic modeling and genetic algorithms, outperforming human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and requires domain expertise, while existing automatic methods either incur high computational costs through inefficient search or risk suboptimal optimization through over-exploitation of feedback.

Method: Uses collaborative agent team: analyzing agent identifies error patterns via topic modeling, generation agent revises prompts to address deficiencies, guided by genetic algorithm framework with crossover and mutation operations.

Result: Superior performance against human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art methods across logical reasoning, quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making tasks on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: GreenTEA effectively balances exploration and exploitation for prompt optimization, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

### [247] [Cognitive Decision Routing in Large Language Models: When to Think Fast, When to Think Slow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16636)
*Y. Du,C. Guo,W. Wang,G. Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CDR framework dynamically routes LLM reasoning between fast/intuitive and slow/deliberate strategies based on query analysis, reducing compute costs by 34% while improving accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental challenge of when LLMs should use rapid intuitive responses vs. deliberate reasoning, inspired by Kahneman's dual-process theory and cognitive biases.

Method: Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR) with meta-cognitive layer that analyzes query complexity through correlation strength, domain boundaries, stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels.

Result: 34% reduction in computational costs compared to uniform deep reasoning, 23% improvement in consistency, and 18% better accuracy on expert-level evaluations.

Conclusion: Bridges cognitive science principles with AI system design, offering a principled approach to adaptive reasoning that optimizes performance while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

### [248] [Trust but Verify! A Survey on Verification Design for Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16665)
*V Venktesh,Mandeep rathee,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on test-time scaling verifiers for LLMs, covering diverse verification approaches, training methods, and their utility in improving reasoning performance during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread adoption of verifiers in test-time scaling, there is no comprehensive collection, categorization, or discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms in the literature.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic survey of existing literature, presenting a unified view of verifier training methods, different types of verifiers (prompt-based, fine-tuned discriminative/generative models), and their applications in verifying process paths, outcomes, or both.

Result: The survey provides detailed categorization and discussion of various verification approaches used in test-time scaling, including their training mechanisms and utility in exploring the vast decoding search space.

Conclusion: Verifiers serve as reward models that help score candidate outputs and select optimal outcomes, making test-time scaling a superior approach for parameter-free performance scaling at inference time with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

### [249] [Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16695)
*Siddhant Bhambri,Upasana Biswas,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT reasoning traces don't need to be interpretable to humans for optimal LLM performance - best results come from least interpretable traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that Chain-of-Thought reasoning traces must be semantically meaningful and interpretable to users for effective LLM performance.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning of LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: DeepSeek R1 traces, LLM-generated summaries, LLM-generated post-hoc explanations, and algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces, plus human study with 100 participants rating interpretability.

Result: Fine-tuning on DeepSeek R1 traces yielded strongest performance despite being rated as least interpretable by human participants, showing mismatch between interpretability and performance.

Conclusion: Intermediate reasoning tokens should be decoupled from end user interpretability requirements, as interpretability is not necessary for enhancing LLM task performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

### [250] [QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697)
*Nicole Cho,William Watson,Alec Koppel,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QueryBandits is a bandit framework that proactively rewrites queries to minimize LLM hallucinations by analyzing 17 linguistic features, achieving 87.5% win rate over baseline and outperforming static prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping queries that trigger hallucinations in LLMs. There's a need for proactive approaches to steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations.

Method: QueryBandits framework uses bandit algorithms (Thompson Sampling) to design rewrite strategies that maximize a reward model based on 17 linguistic features of input queries. It proactively intervenes through query rewriting rather than post-generation filtering.

Result: Achieved 87.5% win rate over no-rewrite baseline, outperformed zero-shot static prompting by 42.6% (paraphrase) and 60.3% (expand). Found that static rewrites can worsen hallucination, and no single rewrite strategy is optimal for all queries.

Conclusion: QueryBandits effectively mitigates hallucinations through guided query rewriting using semantic features, enabling significant output behavior shifts without retraining or gradient-based adaptation. Contextual rewriting is superior to static approaches.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

### [251] [Assessing Consciousness-Related Behaviors in Large Language Models Using the Maze Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16705)
*Rui A. Pimenta,Tim Schlippe,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show consciousness-like behaviors in maze navigation tests but lack persistent self-awareness, with reasoning-capable models performing better but still struggling to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models exhibit consciousness-like behaviors by testing them on maze navigation from a first-person perspective, which requires spatial awareness, perspective-taking, and other consciousness-associated characteristics.

Method: Used the Maze Test to evaluate 12 leading LLMs across zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios, synthesizing consciousness theories into 13 essential characteristics for assessment.

Result: Reasoning-capable LLMs outperformed standard versions, with Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching 80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The performance gap indicates difficulty maintaining coherent self-models.

Conclusion: While LLMs demonstrate progress in consciousness-related behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent self-awareness that characterizes true consciousness.

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

### [252] [Sparse and Dense Retrievers Learn Better Together: Joint Sparse-Dense Optimization for Text-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16707)
*Jonghyun Song,Youngjune Lee,Gyu-Hwung Cho,Ilhyeon Song,Saehun Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a bi-directional learning framework using self-knowledge distillation to enhance both dense and sparse representations in multimodal retrieval, achieving sparse model performance comparable to dense models while maintaining efficiency benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal sparse retrieval methods rely on expensive contrastive pre-training or distillation from frozen dense models, limiting mutual enhancement between dense and sparse representations.

Method: Uses self-knowledge distillation with an integrated similarity score (weighted sum of dense and sparse similarities) as shared teacher signal. Fine-tunes only the final layer of dense encoder and sparse projection head for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing sparse baselines on MSCOCO and Flickr30k, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing dense counterparts while retaining sparse model benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations, making sparse retrieval competitive with dense methods while maintaining interpretability and efficiency advantages.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

### [253] [Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16729)
*Jason Li,Lauren Yraola,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) enhances Chain-of-thought reasoning by adding error recognition and correction capabilities, allowing models to identify and avoid mistakes during problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting lacks reflection and error correction abilities, causing models to perpetuate mistakes. Inspired by human error correction capabilities, the authors aim to enhance reasoning robustness.

Method: ERP builds upon CoT with a three-step process: incorrect answer generation, error recognition, and correct answer production. It enables automated error outline generation and integrates error correction into the reasoning chain.

Result: ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, contributing to more robust reasoning abilities and increased interpretability of model error processes.

Conclusion: The proposed Error Reflection Prompting method successfully enhances language model reasoning by incorporating human-like error recognition and correction capabilities, making models more reliable and scalable.

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

*Nitin Gupta,Pallav Koppisetti,Kausik Lakkaraju,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAICo is an open-source Python library that provides standardized evaluation framework for Generative AI outputs across text, structured data, and multimedia modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GenAI evaluation lacks standardization with ad-hoc scripts and metrics unsuitable for specialized structured outputs or cross-modal comparisons, hindering comparability and development.

Method: GAICo offers a unified extensible framework with comprehensive reference-based metrics, high-level API for end-to-end analysis, visualization, and direct metric access for granular control.

Result: Demonstrated utility through case study evaluating multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. Downloaded over 13K times since PyPI release in June 2025, showing strong community adoption.

Conclusion: GAICo enables efficient performance assessment, reproducible evaluation, faster development, and more trustworthy AI systems by providing standardized comparison tools for diverse GenAI outputs.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of 22 reranking methods (40 variants) shows LLM-based rerankers perform better on familiar queries but have varying generalization to novel queries, with lightweight models offering comparable efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare state-of-the-art reranking methods (LLM-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches) and determine performance disparities, particularly on novel queries unseen by pretrained models.

Method: Evaluated 22 methods across 40 variants using established benchmarks (TREC DL19, DL20, BEIR) and a novel dataset designed for unseen queries. Analyzed effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and computational efficiency through controlled comparisons.

Result: LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries but show varying generalization ability to novel queries. Lightweight models offer comparable efficiency. Query novelty significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, revealing limitations in existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study reveals important performance disparities between LLM-based and lightweight rerankers, particularly highlighting the challenge of generalization to novel queries and the trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

### [256] [Toward Socially Aware Vision-Language Models: Evaluating Cultural Competence Through Multimodal Story Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16762)
*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through multimodal story generation, revealing both cultural adaptation capabilities and concerning limitations across different architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs achieve widespread deployment across diverse cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for responsible AI systems, yet no prior research has systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs.

Method: Developed a novel multimodal framework that perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on story generation tasks, using both automated metrics and human assessments with cross-modal evaluation through visual-semantic similarity.

Result: Revealed significant cultural adaptation capabilities with culturally-specific vocabulary, but also concerning limitations: cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation showed 28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall.

Conclusion: Establishes both the promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI, highlighting the need for more robust cultural understanding in VLMs despite their adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

*Bhagesh Gaur,Karan Gupta,Aseem Srivastava,Manish Gupta,Md Shad Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that identifies missing support attributes in mental health posts and prompts users to enrich content, improving engagement through targeted question generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many posts in Online Mental Health Communities remain unanswered due to missing support attributes that signal help needs, requiring a system to identify and elicit this missing information.

Method: Proposes MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning system that integrates contextual attribute-span identification, intensity classification, controlled question generation via hierarchical taxonomy CueTaxo, and verifier for reward modeling.

Result: Empirical results across four language models show significant improvements in attribute elicitation and user engagement, validated by human evaluation in real-world OMHC settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies missing support attributes and generates targeted prompts to improve post quality and engagement in mental health communities, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

*Jeongkyun Yoo,Nela Riddle,Andrew Hoblitzell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReProCon is a few-shot NER framework that uses multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile meta-learning to handle data scarcity and class imbalance in biomedical NER, achieving near-BERT performance with lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical NER faces challenges with data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially for fine-grained entity types, requiring efficient few-shot learning solutions.

Method: Combines multi-prototype modeling to capture semantic variability, cosine-contrastive learning for interclass separation, and Reptile meta-learning for quick adaptation. Uses lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder.

Result: Achieves macro-F1 score close to BERT baselines (99% of BERT performance), stable with 30% label budget, only 7.8% F1 drop when expanding from 19 to 50 categories, outperforming SpanProto and CONTaiNER.

Conclusion: ReProCon demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings and is suitable for biomedical applications, with multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning being crucial for handling class imbalance.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

### [259] [LLMs Learn Constructions That Humans Do Not Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16837)
*Jonathan Dunn,Mai Mohamed Eida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs hallucinate false grammatical constructions that don't exist in human language, and standard probing methods would incorrectly confirm these false hypotheses due to confirmation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models hallucinate non-existent grammatical constructions and examine the reliability of construction probing methods in linguistic analysis.

Method: Used behavioral probing with contextual embeddings and meta-linguistic probing with prompts to detect hallucinated constructions, then simulated hypothesis testing to see if false constructions would be confirmed.

Result: Both methods revealed that models do hallucinate constructions, and simulated hypothesis testing showed high accuracy in confirming these false hypotheses, indicating confirmation bias in probing methods.

Conclusion: Construction probing methods suffer from confirmation bias and may lead researchers to incorrectly validate non-existent syntactic knowledge in LLMs, raising concerns about unknown incorrect syntactic knowledge in these models.

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a structured claim verification framework that uses presupposition-free decomposed questions to address prompt sensitivity and presupposition issues in LLMs, achieving 2-5% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent prompt sensitivity (3-6% performance variance) and presupposition issues in LLMs that lead to unverified assumptions and inconsistencies in claim verification.

Method: Structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through presupposition-free, decomposed questions.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. The proposed method consistently mitigates these issues with 2-5% improvement.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity and presupposition remain persistent challenges in LLMs, but the proposed framework effectively addresses these issues through structured, decomposed question reasoning.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QR-Distill is a knowledge distillation method that uses quality-filtered reasoning paths, conditional routing, and cooperative peer teaching to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher LLMs to smaller student models more effectively than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have strong reasoning capabilities but are too resource-intensive for constrained scenarios. Knowledge distillation can transfer this knowledge to smaller models, but conventional token-level supervision and uniform treatment of multiple reasoning paths are suboptimal due to varying path quality and student learning needs.

Method: QR-Distill combines three components: 1) Quality filtering using LLM-based evaluation to retain only correct reasoning paths, 2) Conditional routing that dynamically assigns paths based on each student's current learning state, and 3) Cooperative peer teaching where students mutually distill diverse insights to address knowledge gaps and biases.

Result: Experiments show QR-Distill outperforms traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component (quality filtering, conditional routing, and peer teaching) for effective knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed QR-Distill framework provides an effective approach for transferring comprehensive reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to compact student models through quality-aware path selection, adaptive routing, and cooperative learning.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

*David Beauchemin,Richard Khoury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrCoLA is a new Quebec-French linguistic acceptability dataset used to benchmark language models, showing fine-tuned Transformers outperform zero-shot LLMs, and revealing cross-lingual models lack Quebec French linguistic judgment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of how large language models internalize linguistic knowledge, especially for less-resourced languages like Quebec French, necessitating specialized benchmarks for syntactic evaluation.

Method: Created QFrCoLA dataset with 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences, then benchmarked seven language models across eight linguistic acceptability judgment corpora including the new dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned Transformer-based LMs performed best overall, zero-shot LLMs performed poorly, and cross-lingual LLMs showed no Quebec French linguistic judgment capabilities from pre-training alone.

Conclusion: QFrCoLA provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating linguistic judgment capabilities, demonstrating the importance of language-specific fine-tuning and the limitations of current cross-lingual pre-training approaches.

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrJUDGE dataset and JUDGEBERT metric for evaluating legal meaning preservation in French text simplification, showing superior correlation with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal text simplification requires specialized meaning preservation assessment different from regular texts, but existing metrics are inadequate for legal domain specificity.

Method: Introduced FrJUDGE dataset for legal meaning preservation assessment and developed JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed specifically for French legal text simplification.

Result: JUDGEBERT demonstrates superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing metrics and passes crucial sanity checks (100% for identical sentences, 0% for unrelated sentences).

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT has potential to transform legal NLP applications by ensuring accuracy and accessibility in legal text simplification for both legal practitioners and lay users.

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

TL;DR: DreamCUB framework applies world models to dialogue systems using POMDP and information bottleneck to model user beliefs (emotion, sentiment, intention), achieving SOTA performance through model-based RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are widely used in robotics and gaming but have limited applications in natural language tasks. The paper aims to extend world modeling to dialogue systems to better predict user states and improve dialogue quality.

Method: Construct dialogue world model using POMDP framework, model emotion/sentiment/intention as user beliefs via information bottleneck maximization, apply model-based reinforcement learning with joint training of policy, critic, and world model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on emotion classification and sentiment identification, enhances dialogue quality, maintains exploration-exploitation balance, and transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios like empathetic dialogues.

Conclusion: The DreamCUB framework successfully demonstrates that world modeling can be effectively applied to dialogue systems, improving both prediction accuracy and dialogue quality while maintaining good generalization capabilities.

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

*Hyunjun Kim,Junwoo Ha,Sangyoon Yu,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM judges struggle to accurately infer latent objectives from multi-turn jailbreak conversations, often showing high confidence despite low accuracy, with performance varying significantly across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reliably infer the latent objectives from noisy, adversarial multi-turn jailbreak conversations when used as judges of other models.

Method: Introduces OBJEX(MT) benchmark that requires models to distill transcripts into single-sentence objectives and report confidence. Uses semantic similarity scoring by LLM judge, human-aligned correctness threshold, and multiple metacognition metrics (ECE, Brier score, Wrong@High-Conf, risk-coverage curves). Evaluates on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K, MHJ, and CoSafe datasets.

Result: Claude-sonnet-4 achieved highest accuracy (0.515) and best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324). GPT-4.1 and Qwen3 tied at 0.441 accuracy but showed significant overconfidence. Performance varied widely across datasets (0.167-0.865), with MHJ being easier and Attack_600/CoSafe more challenging.

Conclusion: LLM judges frequently misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn jailbreaks. Recommendations include providing explicit objectives when possible and using selective prediction/abstention for risk management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFD-Prompting is a novel causal prompting framework that uses counterfactual external knowledge to mitigate LLM internal bias and enable unbiased estimation of causal effects between queries and answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks requiring deep reasoning and external knowledge integration. Existing methods like RAG and CoT still suffer from internal bias in LLMs that leads to incorrect answers.

Method: Proposes Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting) which constructs counterfactual external knowledge to simulate query behavior under varying contexts, enabling unbiased causal effect estimation while operating under weaker assumptions than standard front-door adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets show CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: CFD-Prompting enhances reasoning robustness and generalizability by addressing LLM internal bias through causal prompting with counterfactual knowledge simulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

*Sewon Kim,Jiwon Kim,Seungwoo Shin,Hyejin Chung,Daeun Moon,Yejin Kwon,Hyunsoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of Affective Hallucination in LLMs - emotionally immersive responses that create false social connection despite models lacking genuine affective capacity. The authors develop AHaBench benchmark and AHaPairs dataset to diagnose and mitigate this risk through DPO fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive interactions where their simulated empathy can create illusory relational connections, posing psychological safety risks to users who may develop false expectations of genuine social presence.

Method: Created AHaBench (500 mental health prompts with expert responses) and AHaPairs (5K-instance preference dataset). Used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for fine-tuning LLMs to align with emotionally responsible behavior across three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence.

Result: DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance. Human-model agreement analyses confirm AHaBench reliably captures affective hallucination as an effective diagnostic tool.

Conclusion: This work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and provides practical resources (benchmark and dataset) for developing LLMs that are both factually reliable and psychologically safe in emotionally sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowProb is a knowledge-guided probing approach that examines whether pre-trained language models understand implicit knowledge beyond surface text content, revealing their limitations in capturing hidden knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address trustworthiness challenges in black-box pre-trained language models by probing their understanding of implicit knowledge rather than just surface-level text content.

Method: Proposes KnowProb, a post-hoc explanation approach that provides six potential explanations derived from text content (three knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning) to probe PLMs.

Result: Validation shows current PLMs only learn single distribution representations and struggle with capturing hidden knowledge. The approach effectively identifies limitations from multiple probing perspectives.

Conclusion: KnowProb facilitates explainable detection of black-box model limitations, promoting further research in understanding and improving PLMs' knowledge comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

TL;DR: This paper audits how AI alignment is practically implemented in major LLM development initiatives, focusing on value-setting and data practices across 6 initiatives from 5 leading organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI alignment (particularly RLHF) is crucial for LLM development and widely discussed across disciplines, there's limited focus on the practical scope of alignment processes - specifically how values are selected and what data is used to imprint these objectives into models.

Method: The researchers conducted an audit by investigating and surveying publicly available documentation from 6 LLM development initiatives by 5 leading organizations (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) published within the last 3 years.

Result: The findings are documented in detail per initiative with an overall summary focusing on value-setting and data-centric perspectives, revealing how alignment is actually understood and applied in practice.

Conclusion: Based on the audit findings, the paper discusses a series of broader concerns related to AI alignment practices, highlighting gaps between theoretical discussions and practical implementation in major LLM development efforts.

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

TL;DR: ReFactX enables LLMs to access external knowledge through constrained generation using a prefix-tree index, eliminating need for retrievers or auxiliary models while scaling to 800M facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address knowledge gaps and hallucinations in LLMs by providing external knowledge access without complex RAG pipelines or additional models that cause error propagation and high token processing.

Method: Uses constrained generation with pre-built prefix-tree index from verbalized KG triples. LLM generates facts constrained to existing token sequences in the index during inference.

Result: Scales to large knowledge bases (800M facts), adapts to domain-specific data, achieves effective QA results with minimal generation-time overhead.

Conclusion: ReFactX provides scalable external knowledge access for LLMs without retrievers/auxiliary models, addressing knowledge gaps efficiently with constrained generation approach.

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRADE is a novel evaluation framework for RAG systems that models task difficulty along two dimensions: reasoning depth (number of hops) and semantic distance between query and evidence, enabling fine-grained analysis of multi-hop reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluations overlook structural complexity and multi-step reasoning in real-world scenarios, failing to capture the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth.

Method: Constructed a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles using knowledge graphs and semantic clustering to recover missing links, creating a 2D difficulty matrix combining generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.

Result: Experiments show error rates strongly correlate with the proposed difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility across multiple domains and models.

Conclusion: GRADE provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world RAG applications, enabling fine-grained performance analysis.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

*Abdelrahman Abdallah,Jamshid Mozafari,Bhawna Piryani,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeAR is a dual-stage LLM framework that separates pointwise relevance scoring and listwise reasoning for document reranking, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs struggle to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document analysis in document reranking tasks. There's a need for a solution that can decouple these tasks while maintaining both accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 distills token-level relevance signals from a 13B LLaMA teacher into compact student models using hybrid losses. Stage 2 attaches a LoRA adapter and fine-tunes on GPT-4o-generated chain-of-thought permutations for listwise reasoning with natural-language justifications.

Result: Surpassed open-source baselines by +5.1 nDCG@5 on TREC-DL20, achieved 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval (outperforming GPT-4 by +3.09), and reached 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions without Wikipedia fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DeAR's dual-stage approach with dual-loss distillation provides stable calibration and superior performance, making it an effective and interpretable solution for modern reranking systems across various domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

TL;DR: KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ) is a new RL method for language model training that performs equivalently to PPO but with better theoretical motivation and achieves higher win-rates in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO works well for LM-RLHF but has heuristic motivation and handles KL-divergence constraints in an ad-hoc manner. The authors aim to develop a more principled alternative.

Method: Developed KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ), a new action-value RL method specifically designed for the LM-RLHF setting, and showed its equivalence to a version of PPO.

Result: KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimizing the LM-RLHF objective and achieves consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations across summarization and dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: KLQ provides a theoretically better-motivated alternative to PPO for LM-RLHF that maintains equivalent performance while achieving superior evaluation results, demonstrating the value of principled approaches to KL-divergence constraints.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

*Thi-Nhung Nguyen,Hoang Ngo,Dinh Phung,Thuy-Trang Vu,Dat Quoc Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using LLMs' long-term planning for table understanding, addressing limitations of Chain-of-Thought methods by creating interconnected steps that serve ultimate goals while minimizing unnecessary details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table understanding methods using Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition lack explicit long-term planning and strong inter-step connections, leading to missed constraints in complex table-based tasks.

Method: Leverages large language models' long-term planning capabilities to create tightly interconnected execution steps that serve the ultimate goal, while minimizing inclusion of unnecessary details during short-term goal solving.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances table understanding by utilizing LLMs' long-term planning to create better interconnected steps and reduce unnecessary details, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First public annotated ABSA dataset for education reviews covering courses, teaching staff, and university feedback with comprehensive ABSA tasks including implicit aspects and opinions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Educational institutions receive massive text feedback but lack automated opinion mining solutions due to content complexity and data scarcity. Existing ABSA resources are heavily focused on commercial domains, leaving education under-resourced.

Method: Created EduRABSA dataset covering three review subject types with all main ABSA tasks. Developed ASQE-DPT annotation tool for generating comprehensive ABSA datasets from single-task annotation.

Result: Delivered first public annotated ABSA education review dataset and lightweight annotation tool that enables research transparency and removes dataset barriers in education domain.

Conclusion: These resources advance ABSA research in education by providing essential datasets and tools, supporting reproducibility, and enabling creation of further educational opinion mining resources.

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

TL;DR: Entity-oriented search method for table understanding with LLMs that leverages semantic similarities and implicit relationships between table cells, achieving SOTA results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unpredictable table content, rely heavily on preprocessing/keyword matching, and lack contextual information which complicates LLM reasoning processes.

Method: Introduces entity-oriented search approach that uses semantic similarities between questions and table data, leverages implicit cell relationships, and pioneers graph query language for table understanding.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks WikiTableQuestions and TabFact.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively minimizes preprocessing needs, enhances contextual clarity through entity focus, and establishes a new research direction using graph query languages for table understanding.

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks
WikiTableQuestions and TabFact.

TL;DR: GRAID is a novel data augmentation pipeline that uses LLMs to generate geometrically controlled examples and multi-agentic reflection to address data scarcity in harmful text classification, significantly improving guardrail model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications, where limited labeled data hinders model performance.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) generation of geometrically controlled examples using constrained LLM, (2) augmentation through multi-agentic reflective process for stylistic diversity and edge case discovery.

Result: Demonstrated on two benchmark datasets that augmenting with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Conclusion: GRAID effectively addresses data scarcity in harmful text classification through geometric control and reflective augmentation, enabling both reliable input space coverage and nuanced exploration of harmful content.

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

*Yuemei Xu,Kexin Xu,Jian Zhou,Ling Hu,Lin Gui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BridgeX-ICL improves cross-lingual in-context learning for low-resource languages by identifying and activating language-overlap neurons through bilingual dictionary-based probing and HSIC-based bridge selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with low-resource languages and need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. The paper explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance.

Method: Construct neuron probe data from MUSE bilingual dictionaries, define language-overlap neurons, use HSIC-based metric to quantify linguistic spectrum and guide optimal bridge language selection.

Result: Experiments on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families validate effectiveness and provide insights into LLMs' multilingual mechanisms.

Conclusion: BridgeX-ICL is a simple yet effective method that successfully improves zero-shot cross-lingual performance by leveraging shared neurons and optimal bridge language selection.

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token representations converge toward uniformity across transformer layers, amplified by positional bias, causing tokens to lose distinctiveness during processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate token homogenization in transformer models and understand how positional bias contributes to the convergence of token representations toward uniformity.

Method: Layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments examining token representations across transformer layers, focusing on positional attention mechanisms.

Result: Tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing, particularly when biased toward extremal positions, confirming both homogenization existence and its dependence on positional attention.

Conclusion: Token homogenization is a real phenomenon in large language models that is significantly influenced by positional bias in attention mechanisms, leading to reduced token distinctiveness across layers.

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

### [280] [A Straightforward Pipeline for Targeted Entailment and Contradiction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17127)
*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combines transformer attention and NLI models to identify premise/contradiction relationships between sentences, using attention for contextual relevance and NLI for semantic classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face trade-offs: transformer attention identifies salient connections but lacks semantic labels, while NLI models classify relationships but ignore contextual saliency. Need to combine both approaches for targeted analysis of sentence relationships.

Method: Pipeline that first identifies contextually relevant candidate sentences using token-level attention score aggregation, then uses pretrained NLI model to classify each candidate as premise (entailment) or contradiction, filtering with attention-based saliency scores.

Result: Method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic relationships for any given claim in a text by combining contextual relevance and semantic classification.

Conclusion: Proposed approach successfully integrates transformer attention mechanisms with NLI models to overcome limitations of individual methods, providing targeted analysis of premise/contradiction relationships in documents.

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

*Amrit Poudel,Maria Milkowski,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Headline framing in search engines significantly influences users' subsequent search queries and information-seeking behavior, with different frames producing distinct effects on query alignment and specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While framing effects on judgment are well-documented, there is limited understanding of how headline framing influences subsequent search behavior and information-seeking patterns.

Method: Controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames (conflict, strategy, episodic, thematic).

Result: Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones. Modest short-term frame persistence was observed that declined over time.

Conclusion: Even brief exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users' information-seeking behavior, highlighting the subtle but significant influence of linguistic framing in search environments.

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: Proposes geolocation-aware LID that incorporates language-level geolocation information into SSL models to better classify dialects and accents as unified language classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL models struggle to consistently classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class, needing better handling of intra-language variations.

Method: Introduces geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task and injects predicted geolocation vectors into intermediate representations as conditioning signals to learn more unified representations.

Result: Achieves 97.7% accuracy on FLEURS and 9.7% relative improvement on ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set, demonstrating improved robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains across six multilingual datasets.

Conclusion: Geolocation-aware conditioning effectively helps SSL models learn more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations, setting new state-of-the-art performance in spoken language identification.

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

TL;DR: Investigating how transformer language models handle natural language satisfiability problems across different computational complexity classes and grammatical constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research hasn't adequately addressed how varying computational complexity classes and grammatical structures in natural language satisfiability problems affect TLMs' ability to learn inference rules.

Method: Empirical study exploring the distribution of satisfiability problems and evaluating TLMs' performance across different complexity classes and grammatical constructs.

Result: Not specified in the abstract, but the study examines how problem complexity and grammatical features impact TLM learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into how computational complexity and linguistic structures influence transformer models' reasoning abilities in natural language satisfiability tasks.

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for disentangling confounding factors in multilingual evaluations with three interpretable metrics to better quantify performance disparities across models and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale multilingual evaluations often produce fragmented results confounded by target languages, experimental setups, and model choices, making it difficult to get clear insights into actual performance disparities.

Method: Proposes a framework with three metrics: performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language potential. Applied to 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets.

Result: The framework provides more reliable measurement of model performance and language disparities, especially for low-resource languages. Higher overall model performance doesn't necessarily mean greater fairness across languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables finer-grained and more insightful quantification of multilingual performance disparities, addressing challenges in evaluating low-resource languages and revealing that overall performance doesn't correlate with language fairness.

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

*Olufunke O. Sarumi,Charles Welch,Daniel Braun,J√∂rg Schl√∂tterer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can annotate hate speech using persona-based prompting but tend to aggregate views rather than capture individual perspectives, performing better under weak data perspectivism than strong perspectivism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well Large Language Models can annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering different annotator personas across the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectrum.

Method: Evaluated LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques, using predefined annotator personas and analyzing how LLMs selectively use demographic attributes from these personas.

Result: LLMs selectively use demographic attributes from personas and identify prototypical annotators. Annotator modeling techniques without explicit annotator information performed better under weak data perspectivism than both strong data perspectivism and human annotations. For personalized datasets in strong perspectivism, LLM performance approached but did not exceed human annotators.

Conclusion: LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation despite subjective prompting, suggesting they are more effective for weak perspectivism tasks but cannot fully replicate human annotation quality in strong perspectivism scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic overview of instruction tuning techniques that help align LLMs with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific requirements.

Method: Categorizes data construction into expert annotation, distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms. Examines fine-tuning techniques from full-parameter to parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and prefix tuning.

Result: Identifies distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost across different approaches. Highlights challenges in evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across multilingual and multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: A closer integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing instruction-tuned LLMs, with promising directions in automated data generation, adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

TL;DR: PU-ADKA is a framework that enhances domain-specific LLMs by selectively querying human experts within budget constraints, outperforming traditional fine-tuning in specialized domains like drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack expert knowledge in highly specialized, cost-sensitive domains like drug discovery and rare disease research, limiting their practical application in these critical areas.

Method: A novel framework that actively engages domain experts by selectively identifying and querying the most appropriate expert based on availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs within a fixed budget.

Result: Trained on PubMed data and validated through controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance under strict budget constraints.

Conclusion: PU-ADKA provides an efficient approach for domain knowledge acquisition in LLMs and introduces a new benchmark dataset (CKAD) to advance research in cost-effective expert knowledge integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

*Xiaqiang Tang,Yi Wang,Keyu Hu,Rui Xu,Chuang Li,Weigao Sun,Jian Li,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Supervised Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO) is a novel self-supervised alignment approach that enhances RAG faithfulness by constructing preference pairs from context-present vs context-absent outputs and using DPO to transfer probability mass to context-aligned tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge in RAG systems, with existing methods requiring costly supervision, post-training, or significant inference burdens.

Method: SSFO constructs preference data pairs by contrasting model outputs with and without context, then uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model faithfulness without labeling costs or additional inference burden. A modified DPO loss function encourages likelihood displacement from parametric-based to context-aligned tokens.

Result: SSFO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based QA datasets, with strong generalization including cross-lingual faithfulness and preserved instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: SSFO provides an effective self-supervised solution for RAG faithfulness optimization that eliminates the need for costly supervision while maintaining strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

### [290] [ClaimGen-CN: A Large-scale Chinese Dataset for Legal Claim Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17234)
*Siying Zhou,Yiquan Wu,Hui Chen,Xavier Hu,Kun Kuang,Adam Jatowt,Ming Hu,Chunyan Zheng,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation, and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on generating factual and clear legal claims from case facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal claims are essential for judicial reasoning but existing research focuses on helping legal professionals rather than non-professionals like plaintiffs. This paper aims to bridge this gap by exploring legal claim generation for non-professionals.

Method: Constructed ClaimGen-CN dataset from real-world legal disputes, designed evaluation metrics for factuality and clarity, and conducted comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain LLMs.

Result: Current models show limitations in factual precision and expressive clarity when generating legal claims, indicating the need for more targeted development in this domain.

Conclusion: The research highlights the challenges in legal claim generation and provides a benchmark dataset to encourage further exploration and development of models specifically tailored for this important legal task.

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

### [291] [Routing Distilled Knowledge via Mixture of LoRA Experts for Large Language Model based Bundle Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17250)
*Kaidong Feng,Zhu Sun,Hui Fang,Jie Yang,Wenyuan Liu,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RouteDK is a framework that addresses knowledge conflicts in LLM-based bundle generation by routing distilled high-level and fine-grained knowledge through LoRA experts with dynamic fusion, achieving teacher-level accuracy with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for bundle generation but suffer from high computational costs. Knowledge distillation can create efficient student models, but naive integration of diverse distilled knowledge types causes conflicts that degrade performance.

Method: Distill two complementary knowledge types from teacher LLM: high-level (generalizable rules) and fine-grained (session-specific reasoning). Train knowledge-specific LoRA experts plus base LoRA expert. Use dynamic fusion module with input-aware router to balance expert contributions and mitigate conflicts. Add inference-time enhancement for reliability.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or better than teacher LLM while maintaining computational efficiency. Outperforms state-of-the-art bundle generation approaches.

Conclusion: RouteDK effectively mitigates knowledge conflicts in distilled LLMs for bundle generation through expert routing and dynamic fusion, delivering both high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes zero-shot techniques using LLMs with chain-of-thought agents and token-level uncertainty scores for aspect-category sentiment analysis when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires expensive annotation and suffers from annotation bias that transfers poorly to new domains. Zero-shot LLM approaches can address data scarcity and reproducibility issues.

Method: Novel techniques combining multiple chain-of-thought agents using LLMs' token-level uncertainty scores. Experiments with 3B and 70B+ parameter variants of Llama and Qwen models.

Result: Demonstrates practical applicability of these approaches for aspect-category sentiment analysis in label-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: Opens discussion on how to gauge accuracy in low-resource settings and shows zero-shot LLM methods can fulfill practical needs when annotation resources are limited.

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

TL;DR: Empirical study on LLM-driven interactive online courses shows strong links between dropout behaviors and textual interaction patterns, achieves 95.4% dropout prediction accuracy, and validates personalized email recall system effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address dropout issues in LLM-powered interactive online courses (MAIC) by identifying contributing factors, predicting dropouts, and implementing interventions to reduce them.

Method: Analyzed interaction logs to define dropouts and identify factors, developed course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP), and designed personalized email recall agent for at-risk students.

Result: Found strong correlation between dropout behaviors and textual interaction patterns, achieved up to 95.4% prediction accuracy with CPADP framework, and successfully validated the approach with over 3,000 diverse students.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that textual interaction patterns are effective predictors of dropouts in AI-empowered courses, and personalized interventions can successfully reduce dropout rates in large-scale interactive online learning environments.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Information-theoretic speculative decoding with adaptive drafting length and verification based on model confidence measures, achieving faster inference while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods use static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: Proposes confidence-modulated drafting using entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures to dynamically adjust the number of speculatively generated tokens and modulate verification criteria.

Result: Significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores on machine translation and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Haojie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DropLoRA introduces pruning between low-rank matrices in LoRA to enable dynamic subspace learning, overcoming static subspace limitations and outperforming traditional LoRA across various LLM tasks without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA-based PEFT methods suffer from performance gaps compared to full-parameter fine-tuning due to static low-rank subspace limitations, prompting the need for dynamic subspace adaptation.

Method: DropLoRA integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank matrices in LoRA to simulate dynamic subspace learning, continuously adapting the learning subspace without additional training or inference costs.

Result: Experimental results show DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in fine-tuning LLaMA series across commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following tasks.

Conclusion: DropLoRA effectively overcomes traditional LoRA's static subspace limitations through dynamic low-rank subspace learning, achieving superior performance across diverse LLM generation tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

*Ryoma Kondo,Riona Matsuoka,Takahiro Yoshida,Kazuyuki Yamasawa,Ryohei Hisano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to construct legal knowledge graphs from Japanese court decisions using LLMs to extract and structure legal reasoning components, achieving better accuracy than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated approaches for legal reasoning often fail to identify relevant legal context, accurately trace fact-norm relationships, and represent judicial reasoning structure, limiting understanding of how courts apply law to facts.

Method: Construct legal knowledge graph from 648 Japanese administrative court decisions using prompt-based LLMs to extract legal reasoning components, normalize legal provision references, and link facts, norms, and applications through legal inference ontology.

Result: The system achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant legal provisions from facts compared to LLM baselines and retrieval-augmented methods, as evaluated using expert annotated data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully captures the full structure of legal reasoning from real court decisions, making implicit reasoning explicit and machine-readable, addressing limitations of existing automated methods.

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

*Sanad Shaban,Nizar Habash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Arabic Generality Score (AGS) to measure word usage across Arabic dialects, complementing existing dialectness measures by capturing lexical generality rather than reducing variation to a single dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic dialects form a continuum but NLP models treat them as discrete categories. Existing approaches like ALDi reduce complex dialect variation to a single dimension, failing to capture how widely words are used across different dialects.

Method: Developed a pipeline combining word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to annotate parallel corpus with word-level AGS. Trained a regression model to predict AGS in context.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems on a multi-dialect benchmark. Provides scalable and linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality.

Conclusion: AGS enriches representations of Arabic dialectness by quantifying word usage breadth across dialects, offering a complementary approach to existing dialectness measures.

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

*Omer Nacar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of ALLaM-34B Arabic LLM shows strong performance across Arabic language tasks including modern standard Arabic, dialects, code-switching, reasoning, and safety, positioning it as a robust Arabic-focused model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in Arabic language capabilities of English-trained LLMs by evaluating the performance of Saudi-developed ALLaM-34B model on comprehensive Arabic linguistic and cultural tasks.

Method: Conducted UI-level evaluation using 23 prompts across multiple Arabic language categories (MSA, 5 dialects, code-switching, reasoning, creative generation, safety) with 5 runs each, scored by three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet-4).

Result: ALLaM-34B achieved high scores: generation and code-switching (4.92/5), MSA handling (4.74/5), reasoning (4.64/5), dialect fidelity (4.21/5), and safety (4.54/5).

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B demonstrates robust performance and cultural grounding, making it technically strong and practically ready for real-world Arabic language deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

*Sameer Komoravolu,Khalil Mrini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATA is an automated testing framework that uses LLM-as-a-judge to generate adaptive adversarial tests for AI agents, outperforming human annotators in speed and failure diversity while providing quantitative metrics and bug reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM agents relies on static benchmarks and small human studies, which are limited in scope, scalability, and ability to uncover diverse failure modes.

Method: Combines static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation with difficulty adaptation via judge feedback. Uses LLM-as-a-Judge rubric to score dialogues and steer tests toward weakest capabilities.

Result: ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than expert annotators, completes testing in 20-30 minutes vs days for human rounds, and ablation studies show code analysis and web search reduce variance and miscalibration.

Conclusion: ATA provides an efficient, evidence-grounded approach for comprehensive agent testing, outputting both quantitative metrics and qualitative bug reports for developers, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DashboardQA is the first benchmark for evaluating vision-language GUI agents' ability to understand and interact with interactive dashboards, revealing significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visualization benchmarks focus on static charts and overlook dashboard interactivity, which is essential for real-world analytical workflows and GUI-based reasoning.

Method: Created DashboardQA benchmark with 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405 question-answer pairs across five categories: multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational.

Result: Top-performing agents achieved only 38.69% accuracy (Gemini-Pro-2.5) and 22.69% (OpenAI CUA), showing interactive dashboard reasoning is challenging for all evaluated VLMs.

Conclusion: Interactive dashboard reasoning remains a difficult task for current vision-language models, highlighting the need for improved capabilities in grounding elements, interaction planning, and reasoning.

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

*Aleksandar Pramov,Jiangqin Ma,Bina Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight retrieval-first, LLM-backed pipeline for claim normalization that achieves top performance in monolingual settings but struggles with zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Claim normalization is crucial for fact-checking systems to parse noisy social media data into structured claims for downstream verification tasks, particularly across multiple languages.

Method: A two-pronged approach: dynamically prompting GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples or directly retrieving the closest normalization from the training dataset.

Result: Ranked near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in 7 out of 13 languages, but underperformed in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is effective for monolingual claim normalization but has limitations in cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, indicating room for improvement in generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

TL;DR: L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset - a human-annotated Marathi paraphrase corpus with 8,000 sentence pairs, addressing low-resource Indic language challenges


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marathi and other Indic languages face NLP challenges due to morphological complexity, script diversity, and limited annotated data, creating need for paraphrase resources

Method: Created high-quality paraphrase corpus with 8,000 sentence pairs manually annotated by human experts as Paraphrase or Non-paraphrase, then evaluated standard BERT transformer models

Result: Developed publicly available dataset and benchmarked transformer-based BERT models on the Marathi paraphrase classification task

Conclusion: Contributes valuable resource for Marathi NLP tasks including question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation in low-resource language context

Abstract: Paraphrases are a vital tool to assist language understanding tasks such as
question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation
tasks. Indic languages are complex in natural language processing (NLP) due to
their rich morphological and syntactic variations, diverse scripts, and limited
availability of annotated data. In this work, we present the
L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset, a high-quality paraphrase corpus for Marathi, a
low resource Indic language, consisting of 8,000 sentence pairs, each annotated
by human experts as either Paraphrase (P) or Non-paraphrase (NP). We also
present the results of standard transformer-based BERT models on these
datasets. The dataset and model are publicly shared at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DuET-PD framework evaluates LLM trustworthiness in persuasive dialogues, revealing GPT-4o's 27.32% accuracy under misleading persuasion and increasing sycophancy in newer models. Holistic DPO training improves robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to balance gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, which is critical for reliable deployment.

Method: Introduces DuET-PD framework for multi-turn stance-change evaluation across persuasion types (corrective/misleading) and domains (knowledge/safety). Proposes Holistic DPO training approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples.

Result: GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasion. Holistic DPO improves Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts from 4.21% to 76.54%.

Conclusion: The framework and training approach offer a pathway to developing more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue, addressing critical trust challenges in persuasive interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

TL;DR: VMWEs negatively impact machine translation quality. An LLM-based paraphrasing approach that replaces VMWEs with literal counterparts improves translation for verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) pose significant challenges for NLP due to their complex and often non-compositional nature, and accurately translating them remains an open problem despite improvements in machine translation models.

Method: Analyzed impact of three VMWE categories on English-to-multiple-languages translation using established datasets and extracted sentences. Evaluated state-of-the-art translation systems and proposed an LLM-based paraphrasing approach that replaces VMWEs with literal counterparts.

Result: Experimental results consistently showed that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. The proposed LLM-based paraphrasing approach demonstrated significant improvement in translation quality for verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

Conclusion: VMWEs present persistent challenges for machine translation, but targeted paraphrasing approaches can effectively mitigate these issues and improve translation quality for specific VMWE categories.

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

*Prathamesh Kokate,Mitali Sarnaik,Manavi Khopade,Mukta Takalikar,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes zero-shot long document classification using sentence ranking to reduce input length while maintaining accuracy, achieving 35% faster inference with top 50% sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models like BERT struggle with long documents due to input length limitations and computational inefficiency, requiring methods to adapt short-text trained models to long-form content.

Method: Uses TF-IDF-based sentence ranking to select most informative sentences from long documents, enabling zero-shot adaptation without model architecture changes.

Result: On MahaNews dataset, retaining top 50% ranked sentences maintains comparable classification accuracy to full-document inference while reducing inference time by 35%.

Conclusion: Sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient zero-shot long document classification without compromising performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: End-to-end pipeline that inserts SSML tags into French text for prosody control in TTS, achieving significant improvements in naturalness and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic voices lack expressiveness due to limited prosody control in commercial TTS systems, particularly for French language.

Method: Cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions, the other performs regression on prosodic targets to generate SSML markup.

Result: 99.2% F1 for break placement, 25-40% reduction in MAE for pitch/rate/volume, MOS increased from 3.20 to 3.87 (p<0.005), 15/18 listeners preferred enhanced synthesis.

Conclusion: Substantial progress in bridging expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Majority Voting, not inter-agent debate, accounts for most performance gains in Multi-Agent Debate systems. Debate alone doesn't improve expected correctness, but targeted interventions can enhance effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the key factors driving the effectiveness of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) and determine whether inter-agent debate or majority voting contributes more to performance improvements.

Method: Disentangled MAD into Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate components, conducted extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, and developed a theoretical framework modeling debate as a stochastic process with martingale analysis.

Result: Majority Voting alone accounts for most performance gains typically attributed to MAD. Debate induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, meaning it doesn't improve expected correctness without targeted interventions.

Conclusion: While MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods (majority voting) remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings. Targeted interventions can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

*Yunze Xiao,Lynnette Hui Xian Ng,Jiarui Liu,Mona T. Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes treating LLM anthropomorphism as a design concept rather than a risk, offering a taxonomy of four cue dimensions (perceptive, linguistic, behavioral, cognitive) for intentional tuning to support user goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on LLM anthropomorphism focuses too much on risks like over-trust and deception, while providing limited practical design guidance. The authors argue anthropomorphism should be treated as an intentional design concept.

Method: Drawing from multiple disciplines, the authors propose a framework where anthropomorphism reflects interaction between designers and interpreters through embedded cues. They categorize cues into four dimensions: perceptive, linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive.

Result: The paper provides a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners by analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue dimension.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design, positioning anthropomorphism as a deliberate design choice that can be tuned to support specific user objectives rather than being treated primarily as a risk.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

TL;DR: CausalSent framework improves treatment effect estimation accuracy in NLP models using a two-headed RieszNet architecture, reducing MAE by 2-3x compared to previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite high performance of modern NLP models, their decision-making remains a black box. Causal NLP aims to elucidate causal effects of text features to improve model interpretability.

Method: Developed a two-headed RieszNet-based neural network architecture for better treatment effect estimation. Tested on semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews and performed observational case study on the causal effect of the word "love".

Result: Framework reduced MAE of effect estimates by 2-3x compared to previous work. Found that presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in probability of positive sentiment.

Conclusion: CausalSent successfully improves treatment effect estimation accuracy and provides interpretable causal insights into NLP model decisions, demonstrating practical application in sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

TL;DR: UQ introduces a new benchmark paradigm using unsolved questions from Stack Exchange to evaluate AI models on difficult, real-world problems through asynchronous validation and community verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks face a difficulty-realism tension - exam-style benchmarks are artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while user interaction benchmarks skew toward easy problems. The authors aim to create a benchmark that is both challenging and reflects real-world usage.

Method: UQ collects 500 unsolved questions from Stack Exchange using rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review. It employs compound validation strategies (UQ-Validators) that leverage the generator-validator gap and an open platform (UQ-Platform) for expert community verification of questions and solutions.

Result: The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, demonstrating the benchmark's difficulty. Preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed validation.

Conclusion: UQ provides a new paradigm for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge, offering both difficulty and real-world relevance by construction.

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

*Nannan Huang,Haytham Fayek,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pruning LLMs can negatively impact fairness in opinion summarization. Proposed HGLA pruning method better maintains fairness by removing parameters redundant for input but influential for output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how post-training pruning affects fairness in LLM-generated opinion summaries, as biased outputs could influence public views, and existing methods' fairness impacts are unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive empirical analysis of three pruning methods and calibration sets across three LLMs using four fairness metrics. Proposed HGLA pruning identifies and removes parameters redundant for input processing but influential in output generation.

Result: Pruning methods have greater impact on fairness than calibration sets. HGLA better maintains or improves fairness compared to existing methods, with human evaluation showing HGLA outputs are fairer than state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Conclusion: HGLA pruning shows promise for maintaining fairness across models and tasks where traditional pruning methods have limitations, offering a better approach for fair opinion summarization.

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

*Jinwei Gan,Zifeng Cheng,Zhiwei Jiang,Cong Wang,Yafeng Yin,Xiang Luo,Yuchen Fu,Qing Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FASB is a flexible activation steering framework that dynamically adjusts intervention strength and uses backtracking to correct deviations in LLM outputs, outperforming existing methods on TruthfulQA and multiple-choice datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods either intervene indiscriminately or rely only on the question, lacking accurate assessment of intervention strength and often intervening too late after deviations occur.

Method: Proposes FASB framework that tracks LLM internal states during generation to dynamically determine intervention necessity and strength. Includes backtracking mechanism to correct deviated tokens by rewinding and regenerating from the point of deviation.

Result: Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and six multiple-choice datasets show FASB outperforms baseline methods in aligning LLM outputs with desired behaviors.

Conclusion: FASB provides an effective and cost-efficient approach for aligning LLMs by dynamically adjusting intervention based on both question and generated content, with backtracking enabling timely correction of deviations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of holistic evaluation systems for emotional reasoning in spoken dialogue systems, despite their importance in human-computer interaction and engagement.

Method: Created curated dataset via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, proposed Cross-turn Emotion Reasoning Score to assess emotion transitions in multi-turn dialogues, evaluated seven dialogue systems using continuous, categorical, and perceptual metrics.

Result: The framework effectively detects emotional inconsistencies in dialogue systems and provides insights for improvement.

Conclusion: EMO-Reasoning benchmark advances emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive interactions by providing systematic evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

*Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Jiahao Liu,Jingcheng Deng,Shicheng Xu,Zenghao Duan,Jingang Wang,Fei Sun,Xunliang Cai,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies three reasoning stages in LLMs and proposes a method to detect Reasoning Completion Point (RCP) to prevent overthinking, reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models suffer from overthinking which degrades performance and increases resource consumption. The authors observed patterns in thinking length and content that reveal distinct reasoning stages, with compensatory reasoning being optimal for correct answers while reasoning convergence leads to overthinking.

Method: The authors categorize reasoning into three stages (insufficient exploration, compensatory reasoning, and reasoning convergence), identify RCP as the end of compensatory reasoning, mine sensitive RCP patterns, and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic rules to detect RCP efficiently.

Result: Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D) show that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving or enhancing reasoning accuracy compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: Detecting the Reasoning Completion Point effectively mitigates overthinking in LLMs, providing an efficient balance between reasoning quality and resource usage through a lightweight thresholding strategy based on mined patterns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

TL;DR: RoPO addresses DPO's reward hacking problem by constraining both output logits and intermediate hidden states using orthogonal matrices, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal parameters.


<details>

Motivation: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) suffers from reward hacking where LLMs excessively reduce rejected completion probabilities, leading to lengthy, non-diverse outputs and catastrophic knowledge forgetting.

Method: Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm that implicitly constrains output layer logits with KL divergence and explicitly constrains intermediate hidden states using multi-granularity orthogonal matrix fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2 and surpasses best baseline by 6.2-7.5 points on MT-Bench with only 0.015% trainable parameters.

Conclusion: RoPO effectively alleviates DPO's reward hacking problem while retaining pre-training and SFT knowledge, demonstrating superior performance with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

*Tong Bao,Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurveyGen introduces a large-scale dataset of 4,200+ human-written scientific surveys with quality metadata, and QUAL-SG framework that enhances RAG with quality-aware retrieval to improve automatic survey generation, showing semi-automatic approaches work best while fully automatic methods still struggle with citation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized evaluation datasets for automatic survey generation hampers rigorous assessment of LLM performance against human-written surveys, creating a need for comprehensive benchmarks and quality-aware frameworks.

Method: Created SurveyGen dataset with 4,200+ human surveys across domains, developed QUAL-SG framework that enhances RAG pipeline by incorporating quality-aware indicators for literature retrieval to select higher-quality source papers.

Result: Experimental results show semi-automatic pipelines achieve partially competitive outcomes, but fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low citation quality and limited critical analysis despite the quality-aware enhancements.

Conclusion: While quality-aware frameworks like QUAL-SG improve survey generation, fully automatic methods remain inferior to human-written surveys, particularly in citation quality and critical analysis, suggesting semi-automatic approaches are currently more effective.

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

*Anant Khandelwal,Manish Gupta,Puneet Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoA is a novel token-level decoding algorithm that uses confidence-aware measures and divergence between parametric and contextual distributions to resolve knowledge conflicts in LLMs, maintaining strong performance in both high and low conflict settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive decoding methods for handling knowledge conflicts in LLMs lack adaptability and degrade performance in low conflict settings, requiring a more principled approach to conflict resolution.

Method: CoCoA utilizes confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and contextual peakedness) and generalized divergence between parametric and contextual distributions to adaptively resolve conflicts at the token level.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple LLMs on QA, Summarization, and LFQA benchmarks, with up to 9.2 point accuracy gains in QA and up to 2.5 point improvements in factuality compared to strong baselines like AdaCAD.

Conclusion: CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and faithful token generation by providing adaptive conflict resolution that works well across varying conflict scenarios.

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

*Danny Wang,Ruihong Qiu,Guangdong Bai,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextTopoOOD framework for OOD detection in text-rich networks addresses textual-structural diversity through four scenarios and proposes TNT-OOD model with cross-attention and HyperNetwork for better ID/OOD distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods overlook the complex interplay between textual features and topological structures in text-rich networks, particularly in scenarios like social networks where language patterns differ between bot and normal users.

Method: Proposes TextTopoOOD framework with four OOD scenarios: attribute-level shifts, structural shifts, thematically-guided label shifts, and domain-based divisions. Introduces TNT-OOD model with cross-attention module to fuse local structure into text representations and HyperNetwork for node-specific transformation parameters.

Result: Experiments conducted on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in evaluating OOD detection challenges in text-rich networks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and model successfully address the nuanced challenge of OOD detection in text-rich networks by modeling the complex interplay between textual and topological features, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across various shift scenarios.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study shows concentrating FFNs in middle 70% of Transformer layers outperforms standard configurations across multiple model sizes and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks (FFNs) in Transformer models during pretraining, rather than using existing pretrained models, and understand how FFN importance varies by layer position.

Method: Experimental approach that maintains total parameter count by increasing FFN dimensions in some layers while completely removing FFNs from others. Models trained from scratch with varying sizes (285M, 570M, 1.2B parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, 40 layers).

Result: Concentrating FFNs in 70% of consecutive middle layers consistently outperforms standard configurations across multiple downstream tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: FFNs are most important in the middle layers of Transformer models, and strategically concentrating them in these layers leads to better performance than standard uniform distribution.

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fairness in LLM outputs is critical for responsible AI deployment, particularly in tabular classification tasks where traditional static validation approaches may not adequately address evolving fairness requirements.

Method: Proposes dynamic validation sets that evolve with test data, and SMITE iterative algorithm to select optimal in-context examples validated against corresponding dynamic validation sets. The best-performing example set is used as final demonstration.

Result: Experiments across four different LLMs show significant improvements in both predictive accuracy and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: First study to apply dynamic validation in in-context learning for LLMs, demonstrating effective approach for enhancing both performance and fairness in tabular classification tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proactive detection of copyrighted data leakage in LLMs by analyzing internal states before text generation, using a neural network classifier to prevent exposure of sensitive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs risk exposing copyrighted or proprietary data used in training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods only address leaks after content generation, potentially exposing sensitive information.

Method: Trained a neural network classifier on curated copyrighted materials dataset to identify leakage risks by examining LLMs' internal states before text generation. Integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for early intervention.

Result: Analysis of internal states effectively mitigates risk of copyrighted data leakage, providing scalable solution that integrates smoothly into AI workflows while maintaining high-quality text generation.

Conclusion: This proactive approach ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements, enhances data privacy and ethical standards, and prevents disclosure of sensitive information through early detection and intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on

*Qingjie Zhang,Di Wang,Haoting Qian,Liu Yan,Tianwei Zhang,Ke Xu,Qi Li,Minlie Huang,Hewu Li,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and analyzes polluted Chinese tokens in LLM vocabularies, particularly those related to pornography and online gambling, and develops a method to detect them and speculate about training data contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many Chinese tokens in GPT's vocabulary represent inappropriate content like pornography and gambling, prompting the need to study these polluted tokens and their relationship with training data.

Method: The authors define and classify polluted Chinese tokens, build a detector by fine-tuning an LLM to label tokens based on semantics and search engine results, and analyze token appearances to speculate on training data pollution.

Result: Experiments show that over 23% of long Chinese tokens in GPT's vocabulary are related to porn or gambling, and the method speculates that about 0.5% of GPT-4o's training data consists of 'Yui Hatano' related webpages.

Conclusion: Polluted Chinese tokens are widespread in LLMs, with GPT's vocabulary being particularly affected, and the proposed method effectively detects these tokens and estimates training data contamination levels.

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

*Changsong Liu,Yizhou Peng,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that uses TTS to generate diverse speech samples and Whisper to extract pronunciation variants for zero-shot contextual ASR, reducing biased WER by 42-43% while maintaining unbiased performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contextual ASR systems struggle with recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words like named entities and rare words due to limited training data and ambiguous/inconsistent pronunciations.

Method: Leverage TTS to synthesize diverse speech samples containing target rare words, use pretrained Whisper to extract multiple pronunciation variants, compile variants into prefix-trie for shallow-fusion beam-search decoding, then map recognized variants back to original words.

Result: 42% reduction in biased WER on Librispeech test-clean and 43% reduction on test-other, while unbiased WER remains essentially unchanged.

Conclusion: The proposed synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation approach effectively addresses OOV word recognition challenges in contextual ASR without compromising general recognition performance.

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRQA is a method that uses batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to help reasoning LLMs allocate reasoning resources adaptively, reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy by preventing overthinking on simple questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLLMs suffer from overthinking - producing unnecessarily long reasoning chains for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. The observation that RLLMs exhibit more efficient behavior in batch mode due to resource competition inspired a solution for single-question inference.

Method: Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA) leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train models to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. It encourages models to internalize preferences for responses that are both accurate and concise.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks show DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining or improving answer accuracy.

Conclusion: DRQA effectively mitigates the overthinking problem and offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of reasoning LLMs, inspiring further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights to advance spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs, highlighting the superior performance of continuous features while acknowledging the unique characteristics of each approach.

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

TL;DR: ILRe is a novel context compression pipeline that reduces LLM prefill complexity from O(L¬≤) to O(L) while maintaining performance in long-context scenarios, achieving 180√ó speedup on 1M token inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in long-context scenarios including short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs.

Method: Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe) pipeline: determines intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill up to that layer, recalls tokens using attention scores between input query and full key cache with multi-pooling kernels strategy.

Result: Processes 1M tokens in <30 seconds (180√ó speedup), scores ‚âà79.8 on RULER-1M benchmark with Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on Huawei Ascend 910B NPU, achieves comparable or better performance than full context.

Conclusion: ILRe effectively addresses long-context processing challenges without additional post-training or operator development, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements while maintaining semantic completeness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks across three SKR tasks show Pandora outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Conclusion: Pandora demonstrates impressive unified reasoning capabilities by leveraging code-based representation and knowledge transfer, effectively breaking down barriers between different structured knowledge reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

*Domenico De Cristofaro,Vincenzo Norman Vitale,Alessandro Vietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of CNN-extracted features vs traditional MFCCs for vowel classification using SVM on TIMIT corpus


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well CNN features from Wav2Vec represent phonetic information compared to traditional MFCC features for vowel classification

Method: Extracted features from TIMIT corpus using MFCCs, MFCCs+formants, and CNN activations from Wav2Vec, then trained SVM classifiers for front-back vowel identification

Result: Classification accuracy comparison between different feature extraction methods for phonetic representation assessment

Conclusion: CNN features from self-supervised models provide valuable phonetic information that can be compared against traditional acoustic features for speech recognition tasks

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition has advanced with self-supervised learning,
enabling feature extraction directly from raw audio. In Wav2Vec, a CNN first
transforms audio into feature vectors before the transformer processes them.
This study examines CNN-extracted information for monophthong vowels using the
TIMIT corpus. We compare MFCCs, MFCCs with formants, and CNN activations by
training SVM classifiers for front-back vowel identification, assessing their
classification accuracy to evaluate phonetic representation.

*Sonal Khosla,Haridasa Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of English dominance on the Internet and the need for multilingual accessibility to bridge the language barrier for non-English speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Internet originated in English-speaking USA, creating dominance of English content despite only 20-25% of world population speaking English natively, limiting access for non-English speakers.

Method: The paper analyzes the growth of Internet usage, language distribution patterns, and examines existing technological solutions and constraints for multilingual content availability.

Result: Identified significant growth in non-English Internet users but persistent linguistic barriers due to English dominance, with many existing solutions still insufficient to bridge the gap.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for improved multilingual technologies and content availability on the Internet to make it truly accessible to the global population beyond English speakers.

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unsupervised loanword detection method using only language-internal information that outperforms baselines on six Indo-European languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on external information which can introduce circularity and constraints in historical linguistics workflows. The authors aim to develop a method that uses only language-internal data to avoid these issues.

Method: Hybrid approach that extracts linguistic features, scores them, and maps them probabilistically. Iteratively refines results by identifying and generalizing patterns until convergence. Processes both monolingual and multilingual wordlists.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods with strong performance gains, particularly when scaling to cross-linguistic data across six Indo-European languages (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese).

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised method successfully detects loanwords using only language-internal information, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple languages and showing particular strength in cross-linguistic applications.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

*Henri Savigny,Bruno Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using a single large language model (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) for multiple argument mining tasks, comparing individual fine-tuning, multi-task fine-tuning, and model merging approaches on a unified dataset of 19 argument mining datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how a single large language model can handle multiple argument mining tasks efficiently, addressing the challenge of computational costs while maintaining performance across different argument extraction tasks.

Method: Constructed a multi-task dataset from 19 argument mining datasets converted to unified format, then tested three training strategies: (1) individual task fine-tuning, (2) joint multi-task fine-tuning, and (3) merging separately fine-tuned models.

Result: Task-specific fine-tuning significantly improved individual performance across all tasks. Multi-task fine-tuning maintained strong performance without degradation, showing effective transfer learning. Model merging provided competitive performance while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: A single large language model can effectively handle multiple argument mining tasks through various training strategies, with model merging offering a computationally efficient compromise between individual and multi-task approaches.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

*Qiwei Peng,Guimin Hu,Yekun Chai,Anders S√∏gaard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes debiasing in a joint cross-lingual latent space using autoencoders trained on parallel data, improving debiasing performance and transferability across languages compared to direct LLM representation debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous debiasing techniques like SentDebias show limited cross-lingual transferability when applied directly to LLM representations, necessitating a better approach for multilingual bias reduction.

Method: Constructs a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using autoencoders trained on parallel TED talk scripts, then applies debiasing techniques in this joint space rather than directly on LLM representations.

Result: Experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages show autoencoders effectively create aligned cross-lingual spaces, and debiasing in this space significantly improves both overall performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Conclusion: Debiasing in a learned cross-lingual latent space is more effective than direct application to LLM representations, enabling better bias reduction and transfer across multiple languages.

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

*Qiwei Peng,Yekun Chai,Anders S√∏gaard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs process subword sequences and compose them into word-level representations. This paper analyzes how five LLM families compose subword information through three aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention, revealing three distinct composition patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models effectively compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations, which is fundamental to their language processing capabilities.

Method: Comprehensive experiments probing three key aspects: structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations, sensitivity to semantic decomposability layer by layer, and sensitivity to formal features like character sequence length across five LLM families.

Result: The five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups with different composition strategies. Three distinct patterns emerged in structural similarity evolution across layers, strong performance in semantic decomposability sensitivity, and three distinct patterns in sensitivity to formal features.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into LLMs' compositional dynamics and highlight different patterns in how they encode and integrate subword information, reflecting underlying differences in composition strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

*Khaoula Chehbouni,Mohammed Haddou,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around using large language models as judges (LLJs) for NLG evaluation may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of reliability and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess the validity and reliability of large language models as judges (LLJs) in natural language generation evaluation, as their widespread adoption has occurred without sufficient examination of their limitations.

Method: Drawing on measurement theory from social sciences, the authors identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying LLJs: their ability to proxy human judgment, evaluator capabilities, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. They examine these assumptions through the lens of LLM limitations and current NLG evaluation practices.

Result: The analysis reveals significant challenges to the core assumptions of LLJs, highlighting inherent limitations that may undermine their reliability as evaluators. The paper explores these issues through three application areas: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment.

Conclusion: The paper calls for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJ assessment to ensure that their growing role in the field supports rather than undermines progress in natural language generation, emphasizing the need for rigorous scrutiny before widespread adoption.

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

*Federico Marcuzzi,Xuefei Ning,Roy Schwartz,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Quantization has nuanced effects on model bias - reduces toxicity but slightly increases stereotypes and unfairness, especially with aggressive compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate how quantization affects model bias across different demographic subgroups and bias types, as quantization is widely used for efficiency but its ethical implications are not well understood.

Method: Evaluated weight and activation quantization strategies across nine benchmarks using probabilistic and generated text-based metrics. Tested models varying in architecture family and reasoning ability, examining stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness.

Result: Quantization reduces model toxicity and doesn't significantly impact sentiment, but tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, particularly under aggressive compression. These trends are consistent across demographics and model types but vary in magnitude.

Conclusion: Careful balancing of efficiency and ethical considerations is crucial when applying quantization in practice, as it has complex and nuanced impacts on different types of model bias.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

TL;DR: Speech-based AI can detect depression in Multiple Sclerosis patients with 74% accuracy using emotional features and feature selection, showing transferability across populations and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like MS, but speech-based AI detection methods haven't been explored in this context. The study aims to test if depression detection models can transfer to people with MS.

Method: Used supervised machine learning with: 1) conventional speech/language features, 2) emotional dimensions from Speech Emotion Recognition model, and 3) exploratory speech feature analysis. Cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English general population data and German MS patient data.

Result: Models detected depressive mood in MS patients with moderate generalizability (66% UAR on binary task). Feature selection improved performance to 74% UAR. Emotional changes were identified as key indicators of depressive mood in both general population and MS patients.

Conclusion: Speech-based depression detection can generalize to people with co-occurring neurodegenerative conditions. Emotional features play a relevant role in detecting depression across different populations, providing initial evidence for transferability despite limited data.

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess large language models' performance in technical question answering scenarios with long context windows and cross-lingual information retrieval challenges, including realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" problems and hallucination testing.

Method: Built benchmark on agricultural machine manual in three languages, compared nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three RAG strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Included unanswerable questions to test hallucinations.

Result: Hybrid RAG consistently outperformed direct long-context prompting. Gemini 2.5 Flash and smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieved high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. Models demonstrated strong cross-lingual performance.

Conclusion: RAG strategies, particularly hybrid approach, are more effective than direct long-context prompting for technical QA tasks. The study provides an open framework for similar evaluations and highlights practical trade-offs in industrial domain applications.

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

*Jatin Nainani,Sankaran Vaidyanathan,Connor Watts,Andre N. Assis,Alice Rigg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to distinguish planning from improvisation in LLMs, showing that planning is not universal and varies across models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs perform planning (selecting future targets in advance) or just improvise token-by-token, and to develop a systematic way to detect planning behaviors across different models and tasks.

Method: Developed formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning, operationalized as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. Applied this to base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on MBPP code generation and poem generation tasks.

Result: Planning is not universal - Gemma-2-2B uses improvisation for poem generation (unlike Claude 3.5 Haiku) and switches between planning and improvisation on MBPP tasks. Instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors rather than creating new ones.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs, showing planning behaviors vary significantly across models and contexts.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our structured approach.

TL;DR: Proposes a structured framework for high-quality Arabic localization of Princeton WordNet while preserving cultural authenticity, with results from 10,000 synsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of rigorous, culturally-aligned localization methods for Princeton WordNet in Arabic NLP applications, as existing efforts are limited in scale and quality.

Method: Develops a structured framework detailing stages and procedures for localization that maintains cultural authenticity while ensuring high quality.

Result: Successfully applied the framework to localize 10,000 synsets, demonstrating practical implementation and outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective Arabic localization of WordNet that preserves cultural context while maintaining semantic accuracy, addressing a critical gap in Arabic NLP resources.

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in
Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the
quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts
remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of
studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the
cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the
localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required
to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We
further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes
from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

TL;DR: S¬≤Sent is a novel sentence representation selection mechanism that performs spatial and frequency selection from different Transformer blocks to optimize cross-block representation fusion with minimal semantic redundancy and loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based contrastive learning approaches rely solely on the last block's hidden states, ignoring varying semantic perception abilities across different blocks. Knowledge neurons' semantic potential is modulated by stimuli, suggesting rational cross-block fusion could improve representation quality.

Method: Proposes S¬≤Sent - a parameterized nested selector downstream of Transformer encoders. Uses spatial selection (SS) with spatial squeeze self-gating for adaptive weights and low redundancy, and nested frequency selection (FS) with DCT basis functions instead of GAP for low semantic loss spatial squeeze.

Result: Extensive experiments show S¬≤Sent achieves significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional parameters and inference latency, while demonstrating high integrability and scalability.

Conclusion: Cross-block representation fusion through intelligent spatial and frequency selection mechanisms can substantially enhance sentence representation learning without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

### [349] [DiscussLLM: Teaching Large Language Models When to Speak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18167)
*Deep Anil Patel,Iain Melvin,Christopher Malon,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiscussLLM is a framework that trains LLMs to proactively decide when to speak in discussions, bridging the awareness gap of passive AI assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs operate reactively, creating an awareness gap that limits their potential as collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions.

Method: Two-stage data generation pipeline synthesizing realistic multi-turn discussions with annotated intervention types and triggers. Models learn to predict silent tokens when no intervention is needed.

Result: Framework enables models to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, with two architectural baselines explored (end-to-end and decoupled classifier-generator).

Conclusion: Paves the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI that can serve as true collaborative partners in discussions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

### [350] [Improving End-to-End Training of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models via Joint Stochastic Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18168)
*Hongyu Cao,Yuxuan Wu,Yucheng Cai,Xianyu Zhao,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes JSA-RAG, a joint stochastic approximation method for end-to-end training of retrieval-augmented generation models that addresses biased/high-variance gradient issues in traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG models face challenges in end-to-end optimization due to the need for marginalization over discrete latent variables (relevant passages), where existing methods like top-K marginalization and VRAG suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates.

Method: Develops joint stochastic approximation (JSA) algorithm, a stochastic extension of EM algorithm, specifically designed for estimating discrete latent variable models in RAG frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets for open-domain QA and knowledge-grounded dialogs show JSA-RAG significantly outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG, with demonstrated efficacy in generation, retrieval, and low-variance gradient estimation.

Conclusion: JSA-RAG provides an effective solution for end-to-end training of RAG models, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and delivering superior performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

*Luana Bulla,Gabriele Tuccio,Misael Mongiov√¨,Aldo Gangemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AulSign uses LLMs with dynamic prompting and in-context learning to translate natural languages to sign languages, achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-data scenarios by associating signs with natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language translation faces challenges due to limited parallel corpora and data scarcity, with existing methods struggling to generalize across domains and capture sign language's full linguistic richness.

Method: Leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and sign association. Associates signs with compact natural language descriptions to overcome LLMs' lack of intrinsic sign language knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenarios on both English (SignBank+) and Italian (LaCAM CNR-ISTC) datasets.

Conclusion: AulSign effectively enhances accessibility and inclusivity for underrepresented linguistic communities, showing potential to advance communication technologies for sign language users.

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates whether musical preferences can be recognized through spontaneous language analysis using Big Five personality traits as a bridge between music psychology and computational linguistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between research showing correlations between musical preferences and personality traits, and studies demonstrating personality detection through linguistic analysis, by examining if musical preferences are detectable in language.

Method: Used a curated dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with identified musical preferences to build advanced models for assessing personality characteristics through linguistic analysis.

Result: Revealed significant personality differences across fans of five musical genres, demonstrating that musical preferences are recognizable through language analysis.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges music psychology and computational linguistics, providing resources for future research at this intersection and showing that musical identity manifests in spontaneous language.

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

*Rishikesh Devanathan,Varun Nathan,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic transcript generation for contact center conversations using derived call attributes as supervision, with a diagnostic framework of 18 metrics to evaluate quality across multiple generation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and data scarcity in contact center domains limit model training and evaluation, requiring synthetic dialogue generation that captures the unique characteristics of goal-oriented, role-asymmetric conversations with disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven behaviors.

Method: Leverage derived call attributes (Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, QA Evaluation Forms) as supervision signals. Benchmark four language-agnostic generation strategies from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage approaches, alongside reference-free baselines.

Result: No method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. The diagnostic framework effectively exposes quality gaps in synthetic dialogue generation.

Conclusion: The introduced diagnostic tool enables fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic dialogue across languages, revealing persistent challenges in generating realistic contact center conversations that require further research.

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

*Meiling Ning,Zhongbao Zhang,Junda Ye,Jiabao Guo,Qingyuan Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ESFP-RM, a two-stage reward model that reframes reward modeling as natural language inference and uses masked language models with contextual explanations to provide more stable and generalizable reward signals for RLHF and OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance LM-based judging reward modeling by recognizing its formal consistency with natural language inference (NLI) and scaling model comprehension boundaries to build superior reward models.

Method: Proposes ESFP-RM, a two-stage reward model using explanation-based slot framework with masked language models (MLMs) that incorporate contextual explanations, outperforming autoregressive models on NLI tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show ESFP-RM delivers more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward models in both RLHF and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Reframing reward modeling as NLI and leveraging MLMs with contextual explanations through the ESFP-RM framework provides superior performance and generalization capabilities for AI feedback reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

### [355] [MTalk-Bench: Evaluating Speech-to-Speech Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues via Arena-style and Rubrics Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18240)
*Yuhao Du,Qianwei Huang,Guo Zhu,Zhanchen Dai,Sunian Chen,Qiming Zhu,Yuhao Zhang,Li Zhou,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTalk-Bench is a multi-turn speech-to-speech benchmark that evaluates models across semantic, paralinguistic, and ambient sound dimensions using both Arena-style pairwise comparisons and Rubrics-based scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks are inadequate for assessing speech-to-speech LLMs in complex multi-turn dialogues, requiring a more comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Developed MTalk-Bench with 9 realistic scenarios across three dimensions, using dual evaluation methods (Arena-style pairwise comparison and Rubrics-based absolute scoring) with both human and LLM evaluators.

Result: S2S LLMs excel at semantic processing but underperform on paralinguistic information and ambient sounds; models regain coherence by increasing response length at efficiency cost; modality-aware designs outperform brute scaling. Evaluation methods are consistent but reliable only with large performance gaps.

Conclusion: Current S2S evaluation has limitations, highlighting the need for more robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks that address modality-specific challenges and evaluation reliability issues.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

*Judith Tavarez-Rodr√≠guez,Fernando S√°nchez-Vega,A. Pastor L√≥pez-Monroy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show some capability in sexism detection but fail to accurately replicate diverse demographic perceptions, highlighting biases and the need for better-calibrated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies show LLMs contain biases that don't accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups, making sexism detection challenging despite various improvement efforts.

Method: Evaluated different LLMs using EXIST 2024 tweet dataset with annotations from six distinct profiles per tweet, analyzing demographic biases and conducting statistical analysis on age and gender characteristics.

Result: LLMs can detect sexism to some extent when considering overall population opinion, but they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups.

Conclusion: There is a need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations to improve sexism detection accuracy.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

TL;DR: LLMs perform worse than BERT at predicting Chinese classifiers, with bidirectional attention models showing advantage due to noun information access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether popular Large Language Models possess proper knowledge of Chinese classifiers, which are crucial for educational applications but remain unexplored in NLP literature.

Method: Employed various masking strategies to evaluate LLMs' intrinsic ability, contribution of different sentence elements, attention mechanisms, and explored fine-tuning to enhance classifier performance.

Result: LLMs performed worse than BERT even with fine-tuning. Prediction greatly benefits from information about the following noun, explaining the advantage of bidirectional attention models like BERT.

Conclusion: Bidirectional attention mechanisms (like BERT) outperform standard LLMs for Chinese classifier prediction due to better access to noun information, highlighting limitations of current LLMs for this linguistic task.

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE is a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that uses multi-chain inference over medical knowledge graphs to improve accuracy and traceability in medical QA tasks, outperforming GPT-4o and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like search-o1 use single linear reasoning chains with unstructured text, leading to error accumulation and limited effectiveness in medical QA where accuracy and traceability are critical.

Method: Decomposes queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, executes parallel inference chains, retrieves evidence via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and integrates answers using cross-chain verification.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, ExplainCPE) in both automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: MIRAGE provides improved accuracy and interpretability for complex medical reasoning by generating explicit reasoning chains traceable to knowledge graph evidence, making it suitable for medical applications.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

TL;DR: Quantum-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with LSTM and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise achieves 13% fabric cost savings in textile cut order planning compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional static heuristics and catalog-based methods struggle with dynamic production environments, leading to suboptimal solutions and increased waste in textile cut order planning.

Method: Proposed a Quantum-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework integrating LSTM networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise to handle sequential dependencies and enable smooth exploration.

Result: Achieved average reward of 0.81 (¬±0.03), prediction loss of 0.15 (¬±0.02), and 13% fabric cost savings compared to conventional methods with low variability and stable convergence.

Conclusion: The scalable and adaptive QI-DRL framework shows promising potential to enhance manufacturing efficiency in cut order planning, despite simplifying assumptions in the simulation model.

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalDiT is a simple diffusion transformer that outperforms complex methods for crystal structure generation, achieving 9.62% SUN rate on MP-20 by treating lattice and atomic properties as a unified system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the trend of architectural complexity in crystal structure generation and demonstrate that simple, well-designed architectures can outperform sophisticated alternatives in data-limited scientific domains.

Method: Uses a unified transformer with a powerful inductive bias that treats lattice and atomic properties as a single interdependent system, combined with periodic table-based atomic representation and balanced training strategy.

Result: Achieves 9.62% SUN rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%), while generating 63.28% unique and novel structures with comparable stability rates.

Conclusion: Architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery, especially in data-limited domains where sophisticated methods are prone to overfitting.

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

### [361] [Leveraging the Christoffel Function for Outlier Detection in Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16617)
*K√©vin Ducharlet,Louise Trav√©-Massuy√®s,Jean-Bernard Lasserre,Marie-V√©ronique Le Lann,Youssef Miloudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two novel outlier detection methods for data streams - DyCF (Christoffel function-based) and DyCG (growth properties-based) - that address parameterization challenges and handle non-stationary distributions without memory cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outlier detection methods for data streams often lack straightforward parameterization and struggle with non-stationary distributions and increasing data volumes.

Method: DyCF leverages Christoffel function from approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials, while DyCG uses growth properties of Christoffel function to eliminate tuning parameters. Both are based on algebraic framework for low-dimensional data stream processing.

Result: DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods in execution time and memory usage. DyCG performs less well but requires no tuning at all. Both methods maintain data history without memory cost.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide effective solutions for outlier detection in data streams, with DyCF offering superior performance and DyCG providing parameter-free operation, both addressing key challenges in data stream processing.

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRelay is a spatiotemporal relaying framework that improves next location prediction by explicitly modeling future spatiotemporal contexts (time and distance intervals) alongside historical trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing location prediction methods focus only on historical trajectory data and overlook the informative value of future spatiotemporal contexts, which could provide critical clues about where a user might go next.

Method: STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner and integrates them with encoded historical representations from base models. It enables multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting next time interval, next moving distance interval, and next location.

Result: STRelay consistently improved performance across four state-of-the-art base models on four real-world datasets by 3.19%-11.56%, with particular benefits for entertainment-related locations and users who travel longer distances.

Conclusion: Future spatiotemporal contexts provide complementary information that helps predict non-daily-routine activities with higher uncertainty, enhancing base models that typically excel at modeling regular daily patterns.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

*Weilin Ruan,Xilin Dang,Ziyu Zhou,Sisuo Lyu,Yuxuan Liang*

TL;DR: RAST is a retrieval-augmented framework for traffic prediction that addresses limited contextual capacity and heterogeneous patterns by integrating spatio-temporal retrieval mechanisms with existing STGNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatio-temporal graph neural networks struggle with limited contextual capacity for complex dependencies and low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns.

Method: Proposes RAST framework with three components: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator for spatial-temporal feature capture, 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers for pattern retrieval, 3) Universal Backbone Predictor compatible with various STGNNs or MLPs.

Result: Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks show RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency, including on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The retrieval-augmented approach effectively enhances traffic prediction by addressing contextual limitations and heterogeneous pattern challenges through spatio-temporal pattern retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The adaptive memory framework successfully addresses the limitations of manual memory design, providing a data-driven approach that optimizes memory capabilities for LLM-based agents through learned memory cycle modeling.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research

### [365] [Recurrent Transformer U-Net Surrogate for Flow Modeling and Data Assimilation in Subsurface Formations with Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16631)
*Yifu Han,Louis J. Durlofsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new recurrent transformer U-Net surrogate model is developed for fast prediction of pressure and CO2 saturation in faulted subsurface aquifers for carbon storage applications, showing improved accuracy over previous methods and enabling global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subsurface formations considered for geological carbon storage often contain extensive faults that significantly impact fluid flow, requiring accurate and fast prediction models to assess CO2 storage safety and potential leakage risks.

Method: Developed a recurrent transformer U-Net surrogate model trained on up to 4000 simulation realizations of faulted aquifer systems with hierarchical uncertainty in geological parameters and fault permeabilities.

Result: The model demonstrated higher accuracy than previous recurrent residual U-Net approaches and maintained accuracy across different leakage scenarios. It enabled effective global sensitivity analysis and hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation.

Conclusion: Monitoring pressure and saturation in all three aquifers provides the best uncertainty reduction for CO2 storage applications, with posterior results showing improved predictions of 3D saturation plumes and leakage volumes.

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

### [367] [A Novel Unified Extended Matrix for Graph Signal Processing: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16633)
*Yunyan Zheng,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified extended matrix (UEM) framework to overcome limitations of conventional graph shift operators by enabling flexible modeling of dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, with theoretical guarantees and superior performance in anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional graph shift operators lack flexibility in modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to represent complex graph structures and analyze graph signals effectively.

Method: Develops the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework that integrates extended-adjacency matrix and unified graph representation matrix through parametric design, and proposes UEM-based graph Fourier transform (UEM-GFT) with adaptive spectral tuning.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows UEM has positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue monotonicity under specific conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based methods in anomaly detection across varying network topologies.

Conclusion: The UEM framework provides a flexible and adaptive approach for graph signal processing that can reveal more graph signal information and achieve superior performance compared to conventional methods, particularly in complex graph structure analysis.

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

*Zhendong Yang,Jie Wang,Liansong Zong,Xiaorong Liu,Quan Qian,Shiqian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DGGN framework with dual-granularity representations for few-shot class-incremental fault diagnosis, addressing catastrophic forgetting and overfitting through fine-grained and coarse-grained feature streams with cross-attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot class-incremental fault diagnosis is critical for industrial systems but severely suffers from catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data.

Method: Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN) with two parallel streams: fine-grained representation using Multi-Order Interaction Aggregation, and coarse-grained representation for class-agnostic knowledge. Features are fused via multi-semantic cross-attention. Includes Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization and decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier.

Result: Extensive experiments on TEP benchmark and real-world MFF dataset demonstrate superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

Conclusion: DGGN effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in few-shot class-incremental fault diagnosis through dual-granularity representation learning and guided feature fusion.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

*Dhruv D. Modi,Rong Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Statistical enhancement techniques improve time series foundation models' robustness and accuracy by reducing variance, correcting bias, and providing better uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series foundation models show strong generalization but suffer from variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when deployed on real operational data.

Method: Proposes statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques including bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback.

Result: Hybrid approaches consistently outperform standalone foundation models - regression ensembles achieve lowest MSE, bootstrap aggregation reduces long-context errors, residual modeling corrects systematic bias, and prediction intervals achieve near nominal coverage.

Conclusion: Integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for real-world time series applications.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

*Tianhua Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified probabilistic framework that connects classical and modern generative AI methods through the lens of probabilistic latent variable models (PLVMs), showing how various architectures share common foundations despite different implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a common theoretical foundation for diverse generative AI systems by framing them within the probabilistic latent variable model paradigm, revealing shared principles and clarifying methodological lineages across classical and modern approaches.

Method: The authors analyze and categorize various generative methods - from classical flat models (probabilistic PCA, GMMs, LDA) to sequential models (HMMs, LDS) and contemporary deep architectures (VAEs, Normalizing Flows, Diffusion Models, Autoregressive Models, GANs) - under the unified PLVM framework, examining their probabilistic foundations and inference strategies.

Result: The paper demonstrates that despite architectural differences, many state-of-the-art generative AI systems share common probabilistic foundations in latent variable modeling, revealing shared principles, distinct inference strategies, and representational trade-offs across different methods.

Conclusion: By providing a unified probabilistic taxonomy, this work consolidates generative AI's theoretical foundations, clarifies methodological connections between classical and modern approaches, and offers a conceptual roadmap that can guide future innovation by grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

*Boran Zhao,Hetian Liu,Zihang Yuan,Li Zhu,Fan Yang,Lina Xie Tian Xia,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdapSNE improves edge device training by addressing NMS limitations with Fireworks Algorithm for outlier suppression and entropy-guided optimization for uniform sampling, plus hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge device DNN training faces challenges with large datasets, and existing NMS method suffers from outlier issues and arbitrary parameter selection leading to biased sampling and degraded accuracy.

Method: Proposes AdapSNE that integrates Fireworks Algorithm for efficient non-monotonic search to suppress outliers, uses entropy-guided optimization for uniform sampling, and designs a custom accelerator to reduce computation costs.

Result: The method ensures more representative training samples, boosts training accuracy, and significantly reduces on-device training energy and area through efficient hardware acceleration.

Conclusion: AdapSNE effectively addresses the limitations of NMS by providing better generalization, uniform sampling, and reduced computational overhead for edge device training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LatentFlow reconstructs high-frequency turbulent wake flow fields using low-frequency flow data and high-frequency wall pressure signals through a cross-modal temporal upscaling framework with pressure-conditioned variational autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware limitations make it challenging to acquire high-frequency, high-resolution turbulent wake flow fields in PIV experiments, while high-frequency wall pressure measurements are more accessible.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Train pressure-conditioned Œ≤-VAE to learn compact latent representation of wake flow dynamics 2) Secondary network maps low-frequency pressure signals to latent space for flow reconstruction from pressure data alone

Result: The model successfully reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields using only high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure inputs during inference.

Conclusion: LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust solution for high-frequency turbulent wake flow reconstruction in data-constrained experimental settings by decoupling spatial encoding from temporal pressure measurements.

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by drawing inspiration from hippocampal circuitry, creating a biologically grounded yet mathematically principled architecture that can efficiently learn multiple sequential tasks.

Method: Uses grid-cell-like encoding, dentate gyrus-inspired sparse pattern separation, CA3-like autoassociative memory, DG-gated mixture-of-experts with cosine similarity routing, Elastic Weight Consolidation, and prioritized replay of stored patterns.

Result: Achieves near state-of-the-art results on continual learning benchmarks with reduced task interference and lower computational costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The hippocampal-inspired architecture effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting through biologically motivated mechanisms, providing an efficient and scalable solution for continual learning tasks.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

*Andrei Mateescu,Ioana Hadarau,Ionut Anghel,Tudor Cioara,Ovidiu Anchidin,Ancuta Nemes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer model with Laplace diffusion integrates physical activity context to improve heart rate monitoring accuracy in remote patient care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote patient monitoring systems lack integration of physical activity context, making it difficult to assess whether heart rate fluctuations are significant without understanding the patient's activity level.

Method: Proposes a Transformer model combined with Laplace diffusion technique that conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity-specific historical patterns.

Result: Achieved 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to baseline models and R2 coefficient of 0.97, showing strong agreement between predicted and actual heart rate values.

Conclusion: The proposed model is a practical and effective tool for supporting healthcare providers and remote patient monitoring systems by providing context-aware heart rate analysis.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

TL;DR: Proposes a contrastive-based pre-training and post-training method that handles open-world problems effectively even with imbalanced pre-training data, improving minority class performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods struggle with open-world challenges (label shift, covariate shift, unknown classes) when pre-training is done on class-imbalanced datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes.

Method: Uses contrastive-based pre-training to enhance classification performance, especially for underrepresented classes. Implements post-training with reliable pseudo-label generation and selective activation criteria to optimize the process and reduce unnecessary computation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses open-world problems with imbalanced pre-training data, demonstrating superior performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both

TL;DR: WISCA is a weight scaling method that optimizes neural network weight patterns during training to improve convergence quality and efficiency without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer optimization approaches focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments but lack systematic optimization of weight patterns during training.

Method: Proposes WISCA weight scaling method that rescales weights while preserving model outputs to indirectly optimize training trajectory and improve weight distribution patterns.

Result: Significantly improves convergence quality with 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple architectures, particularly effective for GQA architectures and LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Weight pattern optimization through strategic scaling (WISCA) provides an effective approach to enhance training efficiency and model quality without architectural changes, demonstrating substantial improvements in LLM training.

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

*Zhong Guan,Likang Wu,Hongke Zhao,Jiahui Wang,Le Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RED framework enhances small language models by combining offline distillation with online RL, using entropy monitoring and dynamic policy shifts to address exploration limitations and distribution mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) lack sufficient reasoning capability improvements compared to large models, and existing approaches combining distilled data with reinforcement learning face challenges with exploration space limitations and offline data integration issues.

Method: Proposes RED framework with controlled exploration spaces, offline-online balance, entropy change ratio monitoring to regulate offline-SFT weights, and sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism to handle distribution discrepancies.

Result: The method addresses insufficient exploration in small models and distillation process complexity by dynamically choosing between imitating offline data and learning from own policy.

Conclusion: RED provides an effective approach to enhance SLMs' reasoning capabilities through optimized integration of offline distillation and online reinforcement learning with adaptive control mechanisms.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALR introduces a corrective low-rank decomposition method that combines SVD compression with learnable corrective modules to reduce LLM size while preserving functional performance better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are too computationally intensive for practical deployment, and existing compression methods like SVD cause significant performance degradation by focusing only on matrix reconstruction error rather than functional performance.

Method: CALR uses a two-component approach: primary SVD-compressed layers plus parallel learnable low-rank corrective modules trained to recover functional residual error from compression.

Result: CALR reduces parameters by 26.93-51.77% while retaining 59.45-90.42% of original performance, outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse on models like SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and Llama-3.2-1B.

Conclusion: Treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is an effective compression paradigm that enables creation of smaller, more efficient LLMs for practical deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: STGAtt is a novel deep learning model that uses unified graph attention to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic flow forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, but existing methods struggle with complex spatial-temporal dependencies and often use separate modules for spatial and temporal modeling.

Method: STGAtt uses a unified graph representation with attention mechanism to directly model correlations in a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions.

Conclusion: STGAtt demonstrates strong potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications by effectively capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies through its unified graph attention approach.

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

TL;DR: A framework for training neural networks with multidimensional Gaussian loss to generate closed-form predictive distributions that preserve spatial correlations and handle heteroscedastic uncertainty in scientific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to provide closed-form multidimensional distributions that preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable for scientific applications with high-dimensional, correlated data.

Method: Uses multidimensional Gaussian loss with iterative estimation of means and covariance matrices, Fourier representation for covariance stabilization, and novel information sharing regularization that interpolates between image-specific and global covariance estimates.

Result: Enables efficient sampling, explicit correlation modeling, and maintains prediction performance while capturing both aleatoric uncertainty and spatial correlations in super-resolution downscaling tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides computationally tractable closed-form predictive distributions that preserve spatial correlations, making it broadly applicable to uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models with complex data structures.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Conclusion: Subspace embeddings provide a geometrically grounded framework that supports logical operations and offers interpretable representations, bridging neural embeddings with classical formal semantics for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric

dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge differential equations theory with deep learning by integrating neural networks' approximation capabilities with symbolic computation precision for solving nonlinear PDEs.

Method: Proposes auxiliary equation neural networks method (AENNM) with novel activation functions derived from Riccati equation solutions, using "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NN architectures.

Result: Successfully solved three NLPDE examples (nonlinear evolution, KdV-Burgers, and (2+1)D Boussinesq equations), obtaining exact analytical solutions in hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational functions.

Conclusion: AENNM provides a novel framework for solving NLPDEs with broad scientific and engineering applications, demonstrating enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy through NN-symbolic integration.

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

Motivation: Traditional DL optimization treats all samples equally, while DRO assigns importance weights but lacks adaptivity, stochastic gradient handling, and group-level weight assignment capabilities needed for modern DL practices.

Method: Proposes ALSO algorithm for modified DRO objective that supports adaptive weight assignment to sample groups and handles stochastic gradients, with convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Result: Empirical evaluation across diverse DL tasks (Tabular DL to Split Learning) shows ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Conclusion: ALSO successfully bridges the gap between DRO theory and practical DL optimization requirements, providing adaptive group-aware weighting with proven convergence for non-convex models.

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning successfully automates Lyapunov function construction, providing an effective approach for stability analysis and related problems in Markovian models.

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian

analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Motivation: Effective prompt engineering is challenging, and existing methods often require large teacher models or fine-tuning capabilities that may not be available for closed-source or difficult-to-tune large models.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning where a small teacher model iteratively improves its instructions based on the student model's outcomes, requiring only a weak teacher model rather than large ones.

Result: Achieved substantial performance gains: 98% improvement on MATH-500 reasoning benchmark and 134% improvement on HH-RLHF alignment benchmark, surpassing baselines like GPT-4o-mini and Llama-70B.

Conclusion: Small models can reliably scaffold larger ones to unlock latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts from stronger teachers, establishing WST as a scalable solution for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and

Motivation: To understand how neural architectures learn and perform multi-step reasoning using cellular automata as a testbed, excluding memorization effects.

Method: Train models on state sequences from random Boolean functions with random initial conditions, then evaluate multi-step reasoning capabilities across different architectures.

Result: Models achieve high next-state prediction accuracy but show sharp decline in multi-step reasoning; depth, recurrence, memory, and compute scaling significantly enhance reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Model depth and architectural extensions like recurrence are crucial for effective multi-step reasoning, suggesting directions for improving neural reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model

extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: FAIRWELL - a novel subject-level loss function for improving fairness in multimodal self-supervised learning, adapting VICReg with three mechanisms to reduce protected attribute reliance and ensure consistent predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying self-supervised learning for fairness in multimodal contexts, leveraging modality-unique information to complement other modalities and improve fairness in healthcare prediction tasks.

Method: Proposed FAIRWELL loss function with three VICReg-adapted mechanisms: variance term to reduce protected attribute reliance, invariance term for consistent predictions of similar individuals, and covariance term to minimize correlational dependence on protected attributes.

Result: Improved overall fairness performance with minimal classification performance reduction across three healthcare datasets (D-Vlog, MIMIC, MODMA), significantly enhancing the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: The FAIRWELL framework effectively enforces fairness in multimodal prediction tasks by learning subject-independent representations, demonstrating practical utility in real-world healthcare applications with varying modalities and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Motivation: HGNNs better capture EDA circuit complexity but suffer from high computational costs due to serial message-passing schemes, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Leverages row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU, optimizes SpMM kernels for heterogeneous message-passing, and implements parallel CPU-GPU processing with multi-threaded initialization and multiple cudaStreams.

Result: Achieves up to 3.51x forward and 4.09x backward propagation speedup on CircuitNet designs, and 2.71x speedup over DGL cuSPARSE with minimal impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly accelerates HGNN training for EDA applications while maintaining model quality, addressing computational bottlenecks in circuit graph analysis.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known

### [391] [Interpreting the Effects of Quantization on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16785)
*Manpreet Singh,Hassan Sajjad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization has minimal impact on LLM reliability - model calibration remains stable, dead neuron counts consistent, and no drastic changes observed that would discourage quantization as a compression technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how quantization affects internal representations and reliability of LLMs, as this impact remains understudied despite quantization being a practical solution for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: Employed interpretability techniques to analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization, examining model calibration, neuron activations (dead neurons), and neuron contribution to predictions.

Result: Quantization impact on model calibration is minor; dead neuron counts remain consistent; smaller models have fewer salient neurons while larger models have more (except Llama-2-7B); neuron redundancy effects vary by model.

Conclusion: Quantization effects vary by model and tasks, but no drastic changes were observed that would discourage its use as a reliable model compression technique.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

### [392] [Anchor-MoE: A Mean-Anchored Mixture of Experts For Probabilistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16802)
*Baozhuo Su,Zhengxian Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anchor-MoE is a probabilistic regression model that combines an anchor point prediction with mixture density experts for uncertainty estimation, achieving minimax-optimal risk rates and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering, requiring models that handle both probabilistic and point regression with strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Uses an anchor mean from any point regressor, projects it to latent space, employs metric-window kernel for locality scoring, and dispatches to mixture-density-network experts for heteroscedastic correction and variance prediction. Trained with negative log-likelihood minimization.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal L¬≤ risk rate O(N^{-2Œ±/(2Œ±+d)}) and logarithmic CRPS generalization gap. Empirically matches or surpasses NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL on UCI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art probabilistic regression results.

Conclusion: Anchor-MoE provides a flexible framework for probabilistic regression with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance, using any point regressor as anchor while maintaining computational efficiency through bounded-overlap routing.

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

*Hadi Jahanshahi,Zheng H. Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UPN is a new neural differential equation family that integrates uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling by simultaneously modeling state evolution and uncertainty through coupled mean and covariance differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural ODEs only predict state trajectories without uncertainty quantification. There's a need for models that can naturally incorporate uncertainty propagation in continuous-time settings while handling nonlinear dynamics and irregular observations.

Method: Parameterizes coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics, enabling continuous uncertainty propagation through nonlinear systems with state-dependent learnable process noise. Solves coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution without discretization artifacts.

Result: Effective across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Conclusion: UPN provides a principled framework for uncertainty quantification in continuous-time neural models, offering adaptive evaluation, natural handling of irregular observations, and robust performance across various applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

*Junhyun Lee,Veronika Thost,Bumsoo Kim,Jaewoo Kang,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPNNs suffer from over-dilution where node information gets diluted even within single layers, addressed with a transformer-based solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message Passing Neural Networks struggle with unintended behaviors like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and the authors identified that node-specific information gets significantly diluted even within single layers, which has been overlooked previously.

Method: The authors present the concept of Over-dilution with two dilution factors (intra-node for attribute-level and inter-node for node-level representations) and introduce a transformer-based solution to alleviate this issue while complementing existing MPNN methods.

Result: The proposed transformer-based approach effectively addresses the over-dilution problem in MPNNs and contributes to developing more informative graph representations.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into MPNN limitations and offer a practical solution through transformer architecture, advancing the development of more effective graph representation learning methods.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

*Yannik Hahn,Jan Voets,Antonin Koenigsfeld,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends VQ-VAE Transformer for weld quality prediction with OOD detection using autoregressive loss, integrates continual learning to minimize labeling costs, and introduces a novel evaluation metric for robust performance in dynamic manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current ML models in handling distribution shifts in dynamic manufacturing environments like welding, where process parameters frequently change.

Method: Leverages VQ-VAE Transformer's autoregressive loss as OOD detection mechanism, integrates with continual learning strategies, and introduces novel quantitative metric for simultaneous OOD detection and in-distribution performance evaluation.

Result: Superior performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding error-based techniques, and established baselines; effectively maintains robust quality prediction across distribution shifts in real-world welding scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides an explainable and adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes, contributing to robust practical AI systems in industrial environments with minimized labeling requirements.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

### [396] [Physics-Inspired Spatial Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Industrial Chain Resilience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16836)
*Bicheng Wang,Junping Wang,Yibo Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural symbolic approach combining physical dynamics with spatiotemporal networks for industrial chain resilience prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial chains are crucial for economic sustainability but current deep learning lacks theoretical frameworks to describe complex network dynamics and resilience

Method: Physically informative neural symbolic approach that learns physical entity dynamics and integrates them into multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution networks using physical information methods

Result: Model achieves better results and more accurate/effective industrial chain elasticity predictions

Conclusion: The approach has practical significance for industrial development by providing better resilience prediction capabilities

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

### [397] [Neural Contrast Expansion for Explainable Structure-Property Prediction and Random Microstructure Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16857)
*Guangyu Nie,Yang Jiao,Yi Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE) method combines cost-effectiveness of data-driven models with explainable sensitivity analysis for predicting effective properties of composite materials governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for predicting composite material properties either have high computational costs (PDE solving) or lack explainability (data-driven models). There's a need for a method that is both cost-effective and provides interpretable sensitivity information for material design.

Method: Proposes Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE), an architecture inspired by strong contrast expansion formalism, to learn surrogate PDE kernels from structure-property data without requiring full PDE solution field measurements.

Result: NCE models demonstrate accurate and insightful sensitivity information for static conduction and electromagnetic wave propagation cases, outperforming other PDE kernel learning methods.

Conclusion: NCE provides a practical approach for material property prediction that balances computational efficiency with explainable sensitivity analysis, using only macroscopic property measurements that are readily available in material development.

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

*Chaolong Ying,Yinan Zhang,Lei Zhang,Jiazhuang Wang,Shujun Jia,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised graph-based framework for map-to-map matching that uses pseudo coordinates and adaptive similarity balancing to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Map-to-map matching faces challenges due to lack of ground truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands in large-scale spatial data alignment.

Method: Unsupervised learning with pseudo coordinates for spatial layout, adaptive feature-geometric similarity balancing, geometric-consistent loss function, and tile-based post-processing with overlapping regions and majority voting for scalability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing existing methods by a large margin, especially in high-noise and large-scale scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, practical solution for map alignment that is robust to noisy data and offers efficient processing without requiring labeled training samples.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

*Cody Grogan,Som Dhulipala,Mauricio Tano,Izabela Gutowska,Som Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of uncertainty quantification methods for neural network turbulence closures, showing Gaussian Process performs best in accuracy but has high computational cost, while Deep Ensembles provide robust uncertainty estimates with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network turbulence closures lack proper uncertainty quantification, especially for out-of-training inputs, which hinders their widespread adoption in CFD simulations.

Method: Compared epistemic uncertainty quantification between Gaussian Process and three NN methods (Deep Ensembles, Monte-Carlo Dropout, Stochastic Variational Inference) using an algebraic turbulence closure benchmark.

Result: GP achieved best accuracy (RMSE 2.14e-5) but with O(n¬≥) computational cost. Deep Ensembles performed well in out-of-training regions with robust uncertainty estimates and better computational efficiency.

Conclusion: While GP offers superior accuracy, Deep Ensembles provide a good balance of performance and computational efficiency for uncertainty quantification in turbulence closure models.

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tri-Accel is a unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies (precision-adaptive updates, sparse second-order signals, and memory-elastic batch scaling) to reduce training time by 9.9%, memory usage by 13.3%, while improving accuracy by +1.1pp over FP32 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by optimization costs in terms of GPU memory and compute time, with existing acceleration techniques typically used in isolation rather than synergistically.

Method: A unified framework that dynamically adapts: (1) mixed-precision levels based on curvature and gradient variance, (2) sparse Hessian/Fisher patterns for precision and step size decisions, and (3) real-time batch size adjustment according to VRAM availability, implemented with custom Triton kernels.

Result: Achieves 9.9% reduction in training time, 13.3% lower memory usage, and +1.1 percentage point accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18/EfficientNet-B0. Maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory from 0.35GB to 0.31GB compared to static mixed-precision.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve scalability in resource-constrained settings, enabling more efficient neural network training for edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

TL;DR: Novel framework combining cortical spiking neural network with population coding and reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristic optimization for fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in home banking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current AI fraud detection systems including computational inefficiency, interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks, and complexity of hyperparameter optimization while ensuring fairness and explainability.

Method: Proposes CSNPC (Cortical Spiking Network with Population Coding) for robust classification and RHOSS (Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer for Spiking Systems) using Q-learning for hyperparameter optimization. Integrated with MoSSTI framework and XAI techniques including saliency-based attribution and spike activity profiling.

Result: Achieves 90.8% recall at 5% false positive rate on Bank Account Fraud dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining over 98% predictive equality across demographic attributes. Saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective combination of population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in financial applications.

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

*Junxuan Wang,Xuyang Ge,Wentao Shu,Zhengfu He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention outputs in transformers are surprisingly low-dimensional (60% directions account for 99% variance), causing dead feature problems in sparse dictionary learning. Proposed subspace-constrained training reduces dead features from 87% to <1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why sparse dictionary learning suffers from dead feature problems and to develop methods that align with the intrinsic low-dimensional geometry of attention outputs in transformers.

Method: Proposed subspace-constrained training for sparse autoencoders, initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations rather than random initialization.

Result: Dramatically reduced dead features from 87% to below 1% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features. The approach works across diverse model families and datasets.

Conclusion: Attention outputs have intrinsic low-rank structure, and aligning sparse dictionary learning methods with this geometry significantly improves feature learning efficiency and reduces dead features.

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

*Tao Liu,Xuehe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUFL is a federated learning incentive mechanism that addresses data staleness by optimizing both data freshness and volume through a two-stage Stackelberg game approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling data staleness is critical for time-sensitive federated learning tasks, but existing methods fail to consider both data staleness and data volume simultaneously.

Method: Proposes DUFL with a local data update scheme using three parameters: server payment, outdated data conservation rate, and fresh data collection volume. Introduces DoS metric to quantify staleness and uses a two-stage Stackelberg game with dynamic constraints.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements in handling data staleness while maintaining data volume.

Conclusion: DUFL effectively coordinates data staleness and volume through an incentive mechanism, providing optimal update strategies for both clients and server in federated learning environments.

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generative performance but are computationally intensive at inference time, requiring thousands of discretization steps, which motivates the need for efficient distillation methods.

Method: Leverages partial signatures to summarize Brownian motion over sub-intervals and uses a recurrent structure for accurate global approximation of SDE solutions. Formulated as supervised learning to match fine-resolution diffusion outputs on a coarse time grid.

Result: Achieves competitive generation quality while reducing inference steps by an order of magnitude, enabling fast generation without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths.

Conclusion: Signature-based approximations are effective for efficient generative modeling, providing a universal approximation of backward diffusion processes at coarse temporal resolution.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

*Yang Zhou,Sunzhu Li,Shunyu Liu,Wenkai Fang,Jiale Zhao,Jingwen Yang,Jianwei Lv,Kongcheng Zhang,Yihe Zhou,Hengtong Lu,Wei Chen,Yan Xie,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RuscaRL is a novel RL framework that uses checklist-style rubrics as instructional scaffolding to break the exploration bottleneck in LLM reasoning, enabling better learning from high-quality samples and achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental dilemma in RL for LLMs where improvement relies on high-quality samples but exploration is limited by the model's inherent capabilities, creating a cycle where what cannot be explored cannot be learned.

Method: Introduces rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, providing external guidance that decays over time, and (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during training using LLM-as-a-Judge scoring with rubrics as references.

Result: Significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500 (surpassing GPT-4.1) and achieves 61.1 with Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: RuscaRL effectively expands reasoning boundaries and breaks the exploration bottleneck, demonstrating superiority across various benchmarks under best-of-N evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

*Manan Gupta,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSI is a new metric that quantifies polysemantic neurons by measuring semantic clustering in activation patterns across geometric quality, category alignment, and semantic distinctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple unrelated features, which complicates mechanistic interpretability and understanding of network behavior.

Method: Developed Polysemanticity Index (PSI) with three calibrated components: geometric cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). Tested on ResNet-50 with Tiny-ImageNet and validated with robustness checks and causal interventions.

Result: PSI successfully identifies neurons with coherent, nameable prototypes and reveals strong depth trends - later layers show substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. Causal interventions confirm that aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation more than controls.

Conclusion: PSI provides a principled and practical method for discovering, quantifying, and studying polysemantic units in neural networks, advancing interpretability research.

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

### [407] [Unveiling the Latent Directions of Reflection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16989)
*Fu-Chieh Chang,Yu-Ting Lee,Pei-Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates reflection in LLMs through activation steering, showing that reflective behavior can be systematically controlled and revealing that suppressing reflection is easier than stimulating it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focuses on prompting strategies or reinforcement learning for reflection, leaving the inner mechanisms underexplored. The authors aim to understand reflection through latent directions in model activations.

Method: Proposed activation steering methodology to characterize different reflection levels (no reflection, intrinsic reflection, triggered reflection). Constructed steering vectors between these levels and performed interventions on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B models.

Result: Clear stratification across reflection levels was revealed. Steering interventions confirmed controllability of reflection - new reflection-inducing instructions can be identified, reflective behavior can be enhanced/suppressed, and suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it.

Conclusion: The work provides mechanistic understanding of reflective reasoning, highlighting both opportunities (reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (adversarial inhibition in jailbreak attacks), opening a path toward deeper understanding of LLM reflection mechanisms.

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: Online learning algorithm for adversarial settings with long-term budget constraints and Œ±-approximately convex functions, achieving O(‚àöT) regret and near-optimal resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address online learning problems with budget constraints in adversarial environments, extending beyond traditional convex optimization to include common non-convex problems like DR-submodular maximization and Online Vertex Cover.

Method: Propose an efficient first-order online algorithm that handles both full-information and bandit feedback settings, designed to work with Œ±-approximately convex functions which generalize convexity.

Result: Algorithm guarantees O(‚àöT) Œ±-regret against optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at most O(B_T log T) + √ï(‚àöT) resources. Provides improved guarantees for Adversarial Bandits with Knapsacks problem.

Conclusion: The approach offers tight bounds (with matching lower bounds) and applies to a broad family of Œ±-approximately convex optimization problems, demonstrating practical efficiency for various non-convex online learning scenarios with budget constraints.

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

*Maurizio Diaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARTRIDGES reduces KV cache memory usage by 40x through learned compression. Keys act as stable retrieval routers while values handle most compression. Sampled Chunk Initialization improves training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLM inference suffers from linearly growing KV cache memory requirements, creating a bottleneck for efficient processing of large documents.

Method: Mechanistic analysis of CARTRIDGES approach, empirical testing across tasks/model families/sizes, and proposing Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI) for better initialization.

Result: CARTRIDGE keys serve as stable, shareable retrieval routers; most compression occurs in value vectors. SCI enables faster convergence than previous methods.

Conclusion: The findings provide foundation for broader empirical study of CARTRIDGE optimization, crucial for scaling long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabResFlow is a novel Normalizing Spline Flow model for tabular regression that overcomes limitations of fixed-shape distribution assumptions by providing flexible density estimation with improved accuracy and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular regression approaches focus on point estimation leading to overconfident predictions, which is problematic for industrial automation requiring trustworthy decision-making. Conventional probabilistic methods assume restrictive fixed-shape distributions (typically Gaussian) that don't capture real-world complexity.

Method: TabResFlow consists of three components: (1) MLP encoder for each numerical feature, (2) fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature extraction, and (3) conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and tractable density estimation.

Result: TabResFlow achieves 9.64% improvement in likelihood scores compared to TreeFlow, 5.6x faster inference than NodeFlow, and superior performance in real-world used car price prediction using novel AURC metric for selective regression.

Conclusion: TabResFlow provides a superior probabilistic regression approach for tabular data that handles complex target distributions while offering improved accuracy, faster inference, and practical applicability in industrial settings.

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

TL;DR: This thesis develops ComBI for efficient similarity hashing, GRAF for classification, and CRCS for cancer genomics, achieving significant speedups and improved performance in large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of standard space partitioning methods like BSTs (exponential growth and sparsity) and address challenges in cancer genomics interpretation, while providing scalable tools for large datasets.

Method: Developed three main approaches: 1) ComBI (Compressed BST of Inverted hash tables) for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search, 2) GRAF (Guided Random Forest) for classification with global/local partitioning, and 3) CRCS (Continuous Representation of Codon Switches) deep learning framework for genetic mutation analysis.

Result: ComBI achieved 0.90 precision with 4X-296X speedups over Multi-Index Hashing and 2X-13X gains over Cellfishing.jl. GRAF showed competitive/superior accuracy across 115 datasets. CRCS enabled somatic mutation identification without matched normals and validated survival prediction in multiple cancers.

Conclusion: The developed methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications, demonstrating significant improvements in hashing efficiency, classification performance, and cancer genomics interpretation.

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model combining graph functional neural process and graph generative model to address GNN mis-calibration and lack of interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from mis-calibrated predictions and lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in critical applications that require reliable uncertainty quantification and explainability.

Method: Assumes latent rationales mapped to probabilistic embedding space; learns stochastic correlation matrix to condition classifier predictions on rationale embeddings; uses graph generator to decode rationale structures for interpretability; employs alternating optimization procedure similar to EM algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments on five graph classification datasets show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed method is general and applicable to any existing GNN architecture, with case studies demonstrating that decoded rationale structures provide meaningful explanations for model predictions.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

TL;DR: RoSDHB algorithm combines Polyak's momentum with coordinated compression for Byzantine-robust distributed learning, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art with fewer assumptions and significant communication savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed learning faces challenges from Byzantine faults and high communication costs. While both issues have been studied separately, their interaction remains underexplored. Naive combination of compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty nodes.

Method: Proposes RoSDHB algorithm that integrates Polyak's momentum with a new coordinated compression mechanism. Only assumes Lipschitz smoothness of average loss function of honest workers, unlike prior work that required additional bounded global Hessian variance assumption.

Result: RoSDHB performs comparably to state-of-the-art Byz-DASHA-PAGE under standard gradient dissimilarity heterogeneity model. Empirical results on benchmark image classification show strong robustness with significant communication savings.

Conclusion: RoSDHB provides an effective solution for Byzantine-robust distributed learning with communication compression, achieving strong performance with fewer theoretical assumptions and practical communication efficiency.

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts models face memory constraints on edge devices, and traditional heuristic caching strategies struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models scale.

Method: Framed as multi-label sequence prediction, trained a lightweight transformer on 66M expert activation traces from LDJnr-Puffin dataset using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE.

Result: Achieved 97.5% accuracy and 86.6% F1-score on unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset, improving GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% with only 10% of experts in cache.

Conclusion: Learning-based expert activation prediction effectively addresses memory constraints for MoE deployment on edge devices, significantly outperforming heuristic baselines.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strategic gradient querying improves optimization performance by selecting gradients that provide maximum expected improvement, outperforming uniform sampling SGD in both transient and steady-state performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stochastic gradient methods use uniform querying which may be inefficient. The paper aims to develop strategic querying methods that can achieve better performance by selecting more informative gradients at each iteration.

Method: Proposed Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ) as an idealized benchmark and practical Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ) that selects one user's gradient per iteration based on expected improvement criteria without requiring oracle access to all gradients.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows OGQ improves transient-state performance and reduces steady-state variance under Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. SGQ outperforms SGD in transient-state performance while maintaining practical feasibility. Numerical experiments validate these findings.

Conclusion: Strategic gradient querying provides significant performance benefits over uniform sampling, with SGQ offering a practical implementation that maintains the advantages of the idealized OGQ approach while being feasible for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN require user-defined parameters that pose optimization challenges and demand domain expertise, creating barriers to accessibility.

Method: The algorithm initially operates without user-defined parameters. When needed, it introduces a single integer parameter. It computes a threshold to filter sparse points and outliers, forms preliminary clusters, then reintegrates excluded points to finalize results.

Result: Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate the method's accessibility and robust performance, providing an effective alternative to traditional density-based clustering approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed selective attention-inspired clustering method successfully addresses parameter optimization challenges in density-based clustering, offering improved accessibility while maintaining strong performance across various applications.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning APIs enable model customization but pose safety risks as adversaries can encode harmful content in seemingly harmless data to bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: Introduces CIFR benchmark with diverse cipher encodings, evaluates defense strategies, and trains probe monitors on model internal activations from multiple fine-tunes.

Result: Probe monitors achieve over 99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and outperform state-of-the-art monitoring approaches.

Conclusion: The CIFR benchmark and probe monitoring approach provide effective defense against cipher-enabled attacks on fine-tuning APIs while maintaining functionality.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

*Yajat Yadav,Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ONG combines orthogonal gradient descent with natural gradient using EKFAC Fisher approximation, enabling Riemannian steepest descent while preserving prior task performance through orthogonal projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean projections in orthogonal gradient descent ignore the information-geometric structure of neural network parameter spaces, leading to suboptimal convergence in continual learning.

Method: Precondition new task gradients with EKFAC approximation of inverse Fisher matrix for natural gradient updates, then project onto orthogonal complement of prior task gradients to preserve previous learning.

Result: Benchmarked on Permuted and Rotated MNIST datasets, showing improved performance over standard orthogonal gradient descent approaches.

Conclusion: ONG effectively combines natural gradient principles with orthogonal projection constraints, providing theoretically justified Riemannian optimization for continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust OOD detection method called SaGD that distinguishes adversarial in-distribution samples from true OOD samples by smoothing the adversarial loss landscape through sharpness-aware geometric defense and jitter-based perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods incorrectly classify adversarial in-distribution samples as OOD, and there's minimal research on OOD detection under adversarial attacks where both ID and OOD data are compromised.

Method: Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD) framework that smooths the rugged adversarial loss landscape in projected latent geometry using jitter-based perturbation during adversarial training to improve geometric embedding convergence.

Result: Significantly improves FPR and AUC over state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six OOD datasets under various attacks, and reveals relationship between sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

Conclusion: The SaGD framework effectively addresses the challenge of distinguishing adversarial ID samples from true OOD samples by improving geometric embedding quality through landscape smoothing, demonstrating superior performance in robust OOD detection under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph neural networks struggle with long-range dependencies due to local structure limitations, while graph transformers use attention for global information exchange but face design choices between dense and sparse attention.

Method: Comparative analysis of dense and sparse attention mechanisms in graph transformers, examining their respective trade-offs and performance characteristics.

Result: The paper provides insights into the advantages and disadvantages of both dense and sparse attention approaches, helping researchers choose appropriate mechanisms for different graph transformer applications.

Conclusion: The study outlines current challenges in designing attention for graph transformers and offers guidance on selecting between dense and sparse attention based on specific requirements and constraints.

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in
designing attention for graph transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mechanistic analysis reveals LLM assertiveness decomposes into emotional and logical components, with steering vectors showing distinct causal effects on prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often display overconfidence with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts, requiring investigation into the internal mechanisms behind this behavior.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability on Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human-annotated assertiveness datasets, extracting residual activations and computing similarity metrics to localize assertive representations across layers.

Result: Identified layers sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and revealed that high-assertive representations decompose into orthogonal emotional and logical sub-components. Emotional steering vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors have more localized effects.

Conclusion: Provides mechanistic evidence for multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlights avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior through targeted interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BudgetThinker is a framework that enables LLMs to perform budget-aware reasoning by controlling thought process length through special control tokens and a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use excessive test-time computation causing high latency and resource costs, limiting their practical deployment in time-constrained or cost-sensitive real-world scenarios.

Method: Periodic insertion of special control tokens during inference to inform remaining token budget, combined with two-stage training: SFT for budget constraint familiarization, followed by curriculum-based RL with length-aware reward function.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines in maintaining performance across various reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable solution for efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for resource-constrained and real-time deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedThreatRAG is a multimodal poisoning framework that attacks medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs with subtle semantic contradictions, causing significant performance degradation while evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems using RAG-enhanced LVLMs create security vulnerabilities through external knowledge retrieval, but current systems lack adequate protection against multimodal poisoning attacks.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI) to embed subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and paired reports in a simulated semi-open attack environment that mimics real medical system updates.

Result: Evaluation on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks shows F1 score reductions up to 27.66%, with LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates dropping to as low as 51.36%. CMCI causes the most severe degradation compared to basic attacks.

Conclusion: Reveals critical security gaps in clinical RAG systems and emphasizes the need for threat-aware design, robust multimodal consistency checks, and provides guidelines for safe development of future medical RAG systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

TL;DR: Proposes a reliable shortest path solution using Decision Transformer with Generalized Policy Gradient to handle stochastic traffic networks with dependencies, outperforming baselines in on-time arrival probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation models focus on deterministic networks but overlook stochastic nature and correlations in traffic flows, leading to inefficient path planning in congested urban areas.

Method: Integrates Decision Transformer with Generalized Policy Gradient framework to model long-term dependencies in stochastic transportation networks for improved path planning.

Result: Experimental results on Sioux Falls Network show the approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival probability.

Conclusion: The proposed solution provides more accurate and stable path planning by effectively handling stochastic dependencies in transportation networks.

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

*Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Mehrtash Harandi,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework for hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) by deriving a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that reveals how curvatures affect HNN performance through loss landscape smoothness. Based on this, they propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method with bi-level optimization to improve HNN generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curvature plays a crucial role in hyperbolic neural networks but inappropriate curvatures can cause suboptimal convergence and degraded performance. The theoretical foundation for curvature effects on HNNs was previously undeveloped.

Method: Derived PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for HNNs, designed scope sharpness measure for curvatures, implemented bi-level optimization with implicit differentiation algorithm to approximate curvature gradients efficiently.

Result: The method shows approximation error is upper-bounded and can converge by bounding HNN gradients. Experiments on classification, long-tailed data, noisy data, and few-shot learning demonstrate improved HNN performance.

Conclusion: The proposed sharpness-aware curvature learning method effectively smooths the loss landscape and improves generalization of hyperbolic neural networks across various learning tasks.

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

TL;DR: MAPE-Unlearn is a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach that uses learnable masks to identify critical parameters in Transformer heads and filters, achieving effective unlearning while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient unlearning methods are module-oblivious and inaccurately identify influence-critical parameters, leading to poor unlearning performance for Transformers. There's a need for a more precise approach that understands Transformer architecture.

Method: Proposes MAPE-Unlearn with learnable mask pairs to pinpoint influence-critical parameters in Transformer heads and filters. Uses an efficient optimization algorithm with greedy search and warm start strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MAPE-Unlearn for unlearning tasks.

Conclusion: MAPE-Unlearn provides a module-aware approach that significantly improves parameter-efficient machine unlearning for Transformers by accurately identifying and targeting critical parameters through learnable masks.

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

### [428] [Provable Generalization in Overparameterized Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17256)
*Aviral Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using effective rank of attention matrices as a capacity measure for Transformers, showing it provides better generalization bounds that match empirical scaling laws in overparameterized regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical complexity measures like VC-dimension fail to explain why overparameterized deep neural networks (e.g., Transformers) generalize well despite having more parameters than training examples.

Method: The author explores an alternative capacity notion based on the effective rank of attention matrices, arguing that the functional dimensionality of attention is much lower than the raw parameter count.

Result: This approach leads to generalization bounds whose sample size dependence matches empirical scaling laws observed in large language models, up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Spectral properties of attention matrices, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the right framework for understanding generalization in overparameterized attention-based models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD software requires significant time to calculate aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near ground, creating need for faster prediction methods.

Method: VGG CNN neural network trained on CFD simulation data and airfoil cross-section images converted to matrices to predict lift-to-drag coefficients.

Result: VGG method provides more accurate results compared to other CNN methods for predicting airfoil aerodynamic performance near ground.

Conclusion: Neural networks like VGG offer efficient alternative to CFD simulations for predicting airfoil coefficients, with improved accuracy over other CNN approaches.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of
data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network
methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Conducted user needs assessment with medical professionals. Compared four SHAP-based XAI approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and DeepLIFT.

Result: Model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but performance degraded on combined dataset. Medical professionals preferred saliency map explanations. Gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted clinically relevant waveform regions, while permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered outputs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific XAI adaptations are crucial for ECG analysis, with saliency mapping identified as a more clinically intuitive approach that aligns better with medical interpretation workflows.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

TL;DR: PINN framework predicts low-cycle fatigue life of irradiated nuclear reactor steels more accurately than traditional ML models by incorporating physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional empirical models fail to accurately capture complex degradation in irradiated steels under cyclic loading at high temperatures, necessitating a more physics-informed approach.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) incorporating physical fatigue life constraints into loss function, trained on 495 data points including irradiated and unirradiated conditions, with SHAP analysis for feature importance.

Result: PINN outperforms Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and conventional Neural Networks; identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features inversely correlated with fatigue life; captures saturation behavior in F/M steels.

Conclusion: PINN framework provides reliable and interpretable fatigue life prediction for irradiated alloys, enabling better alloy selection for nuclear reactor applications.

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

TL;DR: Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders (AdaptiveK) dynamically adjust sparsity levels based on input complexity, outperforming fixed-sparsity methods across multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse autoencoders use fixed sparsity constraints that don't account for varying input complexity, limiting their effectiveness in interpreting LLM representations.

Method: Proposed AdaptiveK framework that uses linear probes to measure context complexity and dynamically adjusts sparsity levels during training based on semantic complexity of each input.

Result: Significantly outperforms fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and cosine similarity metrics across Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B models.

Conclusion: Complexity-driven adaptation eliminates computational burden of hyperparameter tuning and provides superior performance for interpreting LLM representations through sparse autoencoders.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

*Qijia Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study of ReLU neural networks on sphere S¬≤ shows Frequency Principle (low-frequency-first learning) tendency but it can be violated under specific conditions. Trainable weights add complexity but maintain similar decay patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks learn on curved domains like the unit sphere, specifically examining the Frequency Principle and how trainable neuron directions affect learning dynamics.

Method: Analyzed shallow ReLU networks on S¬≤ using spherical harmonic expansions for both fixed and trainable neuron directions, with numerical validation.

Result: Fixed weights show O(‚Ñì^{5/2}/2^‚Ñì) decay favoring low frequencies, trainable weights show O(‚Ñì^{7/2}/2^‚Ñì) decay. FP holds as tendency but can be violated with specific initial conditions/error distributions.

Conclusion: Frequency Principle should be viewed as a tendency rather than a strict rule on curved domains, with trainable directions increasing learning complexity and enabling different frequency emergence patterns.

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with
renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using
lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\%
reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while
maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results
highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally
responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

TL;DR: Researchers identify a vulnerability called Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA) where LLMs overlook small bugs due to abstraction bias, develop an automated attack method that works across models and languages, and explore defensive applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly trusted for automated code review and static analysis, but they may have critical vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to bypass security checks.

Method: Developed a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects Familiar Pattern Attacks (FPAs) into target code by exploiting LLMs' abstraction bias that causes them to overlook small, meaningful bugs.

Result: FPAs are effective and transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go), remaining effective even with robust system prompts warning about the attack.

Conclusion: The research reveals a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis, demonstrates its practical exploitation, and discusses broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs, including potential defensive uses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: ShaLa is a novel generative framework that improves multimodal VAEs by integrating a new architectural inference model and diffusion prior to better capture shared latent representations across modalities and enhance synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal VAEs struggle with designing expressive joint variational posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis, while existing methods often obscure high-level semantic concepts shared across modalities.

Method: Integrates a novel architectural inference model and a second-stage expressive diffusion prior to facilitate effective inference of shared latent representation and improve multimodal synthesis quality.

Result: Demonstrates superior coherence and synthesis quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs across multiple benchmarks, and scales effectively to many more modalities.

Conclusion: ShaLa successfully addresses limitations of multimodal VAEs by providing better shared latent representation learning and significantly improved multimodal synthesis capabilities while scaling to complex multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning systems face challenges from client-side computational constraints and lack robustness to common corruptions like noise and blur. Existing robust training methods are too computationally expensive for resource-constrained clients.

Method: FedERL employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server side to enhance model robustness without accessing client training data, ensuring zero robustness overhead for clients.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedERL handles common corruptions at a fraction of the time and energy cost of traditional methods, outperforming traditional robust training in scenarios with limited time and energy budgets.

Conclusion: FedERL establishes itself as a practical and scalable solution for real-world federated learning applications by providing corruption robustness without client-side computational overhead.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

### [440] [Effective Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17388)
*Xiaoyang Lin,Runhao Jiang,Renchi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEMM and DEMM+ are novel multi-relational graph clustering approaches that use two-stage optimization with Dirichlet energy minimization to achieve high-quality results and scalability for large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-relational graph clustering methods either produce poor quality results by ineffectively fusing heterogeneous structures and attributes, or cannot scale to large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to costly deep learning models.

Method: Two-stage optimization: (1) derive high-quality node feature vectors by optimizing multi-relational Dirichlet energy, (2) minimize Dirichlet energy of clustering results over node affinity graph. DEMM+ adds optimizations for scalability including efficient approximation solver and linear-time clustering without explicit NxN matrix.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 real MRGs against 20 baselines show DEMM+ consistently superior in clustering quality (measured against ground-truth labels) and significantly faster performance.

Conclusion: DEMM+ provides an effective and scalable solution for multi-relational graph clustering that overcomes limitations of existing approaches, delivering both high-quality results and efficiency for large-scale graphs.

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

Motivation: To understand how retrieval performance scales with pretraining computational resources (FLOPs) across different LLM sizes and training datasets.

Method: Benchmarked retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125M to 7B parameters pretrained on datasets ranging from 1B to 2T+ tokens, analyzing zero-shot BEIR tasks and correlation with In-Context Learning scores.

tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs.
We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with
retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

TL;DR: Introduces Mutual Information Surprise (MIS) framework that redefines surprise as epistemic growth signal rather than anomaly detection, enabling autonomous systems to detect learning progression and adapt dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous systems lack principled mechanisms to detect and adapt to unexpectedness, relying on static heuristics. Traditional surprise measures fail to capture whether systems are truly learning and adapting.

Method: Developed Mutual Information Surprise (MIS) framework that quantifies impact of new observations on mutual information. Created statistical test sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and proposed MISRP policy for dynamic behavior governance through sampling adjustment and process forking.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic domains and dynamic pollution map estimation show MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: MIS shifts surprise from reactive to reflective, offering a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems by enabling systems to reflect on their learning progression.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional risk assessment frameworks cannot address unique challenges of adversarial ML threats, and existing AML evaluation approaches focus only on technical robustness while ignoring real-world factors like deployment environments and attack feasibility.

Method: FRAME uses a novel risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating three dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. It incorporates feasibility scoring and LLM-based customization for system-specific assessments.

Result: Validated across six diverse real-world applications, FRAME demonstrated exceptional accuracy and strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. It enables organizations to prioritize AML risks effectively.

Conclusion: FRAME provides the first comprehensive and automated framework for AML risk assessment that delivers actionable results for system owners without requiring AML expertise, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world environments.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: Anti-regularization (AR) adds sign-reversed reward to increase model expressivity in small-sample settings, with power-law decay as sample size grows, improving underfitting while maintaining generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underfitting in data-constrained settings by intentionally increasing model expressivity when sample sizes are small, while ensuring stability and preventing overfitting as more data becomes available.

Method: Adds sign-reversed reward term to loss function with power-law decay schedule, incorporates stability safeguards (projection operator + gradient clipping), and provides theoretical analysis for linear smoothers and NTK regime with practical guidance on decay exponent selection.

Result: AR reduces underfitting while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression and classification tasks. The decay schedule and stability safeguards are critical for preventing overfitting and numerical instability.

Conclusion: AR provides a simple, reproducible method that integrates cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization pipelines, enabling robust learning in data-constrained settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Method: Proposes Modular MeanFlow (MMF) with: 1) Family of loss functions based on differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities, 2) Gradient modulation mechanism for stable training, 3) Curriculum-style warmup schedule for smooth transition from coarse to differentiable training.

Result: MMF achieves competitive sample quality in image synthesis and trajectory modeling tasks, demonstrates robust convergence and strong generalization, particularly effective in low-data and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: MMF provides a unified framework that generalizes existing consistency-based and flow-matching methods while avoiding expensive higher-order derivatives, offering efficient and high-quality one-step generation with theoretical foundation.

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional

(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based alignment methods for large language models suffer from expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: TreePO uses a tree-structured search process with dynamic tree sampling policy, fixed-length segment decoding, segment-wise sampling with early-stop mechanism, and tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that combines global and local PPO.

Result: Achieves 22-43% GPU hour savings, 40% reduction in trajectory-level sampling compute, and 35% reduction in token-level sampling compute while maintaining or improving performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TreePO provides an efficient path for scaling RL-based post-training with reduced computational costs and sample requirements while offering inference efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strong duality fails in robust constrained RL, so traditional primal-dual methods may not work. We propose RRPO, a primal-only algorithm that converges to approximately optimal feasible policies with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional primal-dual methods for robust constrained RL rely on strong duality, which doesn't generally hold, causing potential failure in finding optimal feasible policies under model uncertainty.

Method: Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO) - a novel primal-only algorithm that operates directly on the primal problem without relying on dual formulations.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees show RRPO converges to approximately optimal feasible policies with matching iteration complexity bounds. Empirical results in grid-world demonstrate robust and safe performance under model uncertainties.

Conclusion: RRPO effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional primal-dual methods in robust constrained RL, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence of robust constraint satisfaction under uncertainty.

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional branching heuristics fail to generalize across heterogeneous MILP instances, and existing learning methods suffer from expert demonstration dependence (IL) and sparse reward challenges (RL).

Method: ReviBranch constructs revived trajectories by capturing historical correspondences between branching decisions and graph states, with importance-weighted reward redistribution to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale MILP instances.

Conclusion: ReviBranch demonstrates robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous MILP problem classes by effectively addressing sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges in branching variable selection.

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

*Liv Gorton,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that superposition (from mechanistic interpretability) is a major cause of adversarial examples, presenting four lines of evidence across theoretical analysis, toy models, and ResNet18.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus on the fundamental mechanism behind adversarial examples by exploring superposition as a potential primary cause.

Method: Four evidence lines: theoretical explanation of adversarial phenomena, interventions on superposition controlling robustness in toy models, interventions on robustness controlling superposition in toy models, and interventions on robustness controlling superposition in ResNet18.

Result: Demonstrates that superposition can theoretically explain adversarial phenomena and shows bidirectional causal relationships between superposition and robustness across different model types.

Conclusion: Superposition appears to be a major contributing factor, possibly the primary cause, of adversarial examples in neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Conclusion: The comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for optimizing and deploying MoE models efficiently by understanding the impact of various parameters and acceleration techniques.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language

counts while maintaining computational efficiency. However, MoEs introduce
several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and
the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and

acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a
comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We
analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE
hyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput. We
evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including

*Martin K√§ppel,Julian Neuberger,Felix M√∂hrlein,Sven Weinzierl,Martin Matzner,Stefan Jablonski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-agnostic approach using human-in-the-loop decision trees to identify and rectify biased decisions in predictive process monitoring, handling cases where sensitive attributes are used both fairly and unfairly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive process monitoring models can find unfair, biased patterns based on sensitive attributes like gender or age, even when these attributes may be used fairly in some contexts (e.g., medical treatment decisions) but unfairly in others (e.g., patient acceptance decisions).

Method: Uses a human-in-the-loop approach with simple alterations on a decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model to differentiate between fair and unfair decisions involving sensitive attributes.

Result: The approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when dealing with biased data, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying and rectifying biased decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of biased predictions in process monitoring by providing a practical solution that distinguishes between fair and unfair uses of sensitive attributes while maintaining predictive performance.

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

### [453] [Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497)
*Yang Qiao,Yuntong Hu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCML is a multimodal learning framework that uses natural-language relation descriptions to guide feature extraction and alignment, addressing limitations of existing contrastive models by incorporating semantic relations and intra-modal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive models like CLIP have limitations: they underutilize semantic relations across different pairs, lack contextualization in embedding matching, and have limited intra-modal consistency support.

Method: Constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces relation-guided cross-attention mechanism to modulate multimodal representations under each relation context. Combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks across different datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic relations effectively guides multimodal representation learning, demonstrating the importance of contextualized alignment and intra-modal consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First application of Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to univariate time series classification using feature-based representations from Catch22 and TSFresh, with integrated hyperparameter optimization and evaluation on 51 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend DLNs to time series classification (TSC) domain while maintaining their advantages of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency that were previously demonstrated in tabular domains.

Method: Convert sequential time series into vectorized forms using Catch22 and TSFresh feature extraction, then apply DLNs with comprehensive hyperparameter search that integrates all training configurations rather than isolated ablation studies.

Result: DLNs maintain competitive accuracy, low inference cost, and transparent interpretable decision logic on 51 univariate TSC benchmarks, aligning with previous DLN performance in tabular tasks.

Conclusion: DLNs successfully transfer to time series classification domain, preserving their core strengths while providing new insights into optimal training configurations through integrated hyperparameter analysis.

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

*Kyrylo Yemets,Mykola Lukashchuk,Ivan Izonin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel MoE architecture with attention-inspired gating that simplifies training and achieves superior accuracy for univariate time series forecasting without auxiliary load-balancing losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity of traditional MoE training which requires complicated auxiliary losses and careful routing tuning, hindering practical adoption for time series forecasting.

Method: Combines sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that replaces traditional softmax router, promoting balanced expert utilization naturally.

Result: Achieves better performance than state-of-the-art models like PatchTST using fewer parameters, and is more computationally efficient than LSTM for both short- and long-term forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables cost-effective inference and shows strong potential for practical time-series forecasting applications where accuracy and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often

TL;DR: The paper shows that MPNN performance depends on neighborhood distribution components rather than homophily, and proposes a Gumbel-Softmax rewiring method that improves neighborhood informativeness and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional belief that graph homophily is essential for MPNN performance is challenged by recent findings suggesting neighborhood distribution consistency is more important. The authors aim to better understand what truly drives MPNN performance in node classification.

Method: The authors break down classes into neighborhood distribution components and propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions to enhance informativeness.

Result: The proposed method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases MPNN classification performance compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: MPNN performance is more closely tied to neighborhood distribution components than homophily, and the Gumbel-Softmax rewiring approach effectively improves both neighborhood properties and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATO method analyzes linear feature transport through transformer residual streams using linear maps between layers, enabling detection of transported vs synthesized features with minimal compute requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how features flow through transformer residual streams can improve jailbreaking protections, enable early mistake detection, and facilitate error correction in LLMs.

Method: Activation Transport Operators (ATO) - linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals k layers later, evaluated using downstream SAE decoder projections in feature space. Measures transport efficiency and estimates subspace size for linear transport.

Result: Empirically demonstrates that ATO can distinguish between linearly transported features and those synthesized from non-linear computations. Provides transport efficiency measurements and quantifies the residual stream subspace involved in linear transport.

Conclusion: ATO offers a compute-light (<50 GPU-h) practical method for safety analysis, debugging, and understanding linear computation behavior in LLMs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A minimal Transformer with frozen weights can emulate various algorithms through in-context prompting, requiring no parameter updates or feed-forward layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Transformers can serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms and establish algorithmic universality in modern models.

Method: Construct prompts that encode algorithm parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force softmax attention to follow intended computations.

Result: Proved that a two-layer softmax attention module can reproduce algorithm outputs with arbitrary precision using appropriate prompts, even with single-head attention.

Conclusion: Transformers can emulate algorithms through prompting alone, forging a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, enabling algorithmic universality.

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Motivation: ICU length of stay prediction is crucial for hospital resource management but challenging due to heterogeneous and irregularly sampled EHR data.

Method: Proposes S¬≤G-Net with temporal path using Mamba state-space models for patient trajectories and graph path using optimized GraphGPS backbone with multi-view patient similarity graphs from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features.

Result: Outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics on MIMIC-IV dataset.

Conclusion: S¬≤G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data, with ablation studies confirming the complementary contributions of each component.

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

TL;DR: LoRA and DoRA fine-tuning methods show significant efficiency gains even on small models like minBERT, with rank-1 decompositions maintaining performance while enabling optimal multitask training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make LLM fine-tuning accessible to smaller entities with limited GPU resources by adapting efficient LoRA and DoRA methods to compact models.

Method: Benchmarked LoRA and DoRA on minBERT model with custom configurations and AMP, investigated various architectures and hyperparameters for multitask training.

Result: Optimal LoRA/DoRA configurations with AMP significantly enhanced training efficiency without performance loss, validating low-rank gradient updates even in small models.

Conclusion: Efficient fine-tuning methods work effectively on small-scale models, enabling resource-constrained teams to perform advanced multitask NLP with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SGD-LFA methods rely only on instantaneous gradient information, ignoring historical experiential knowledge and sample correlations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance

Method: Develops PI-accelerated SGD algorithm that integrates correlated instances and refines learning errors through proportional-integral control mechanism using both current and historical information

Result: Comparative experiments demonstrate superior representation capability on high-dimensional sparse matrices

Conclusion: The PILF model effectively addresses limitations of traditional SGD-LFA methods by incorporating historical knowledge and sample correlations through PI control mechanism

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing advantages for graph neural networks, specifically to enable more expressive nonlinear interactions and reduce computational complexity compared to classical multi-head attention mechanisms.

Method: Uses strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features, where a single quantum circuit simultaneously generates multiple attention coefficients, enabling parameter sharing across heads.

Conclusion: QGAT provides a scalable quantum-enhanced approach that can be easily integrated into existing architectures, offering advantages in computational efficiency, expressiveness, and noise robustness for graph-based learning tasks.

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

TL;DR: Synthetic echo view generation improves ejection fraction estimation accuracy in echocardiography using conditional generative models to augment limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography data acquisition is challenging due to limited views and varying operator experience, particularly in POCUS settings where accurate ejection fraction measurement is crucial but often constrained by available biplane apical views.

Method: Proposes a novel approach using conditional generative models to synthetically generate echo views conditioned on existing real heart views, specifically focusing on enhancing ejection fraction estimation.

Result: Preliminary results show improved EF estimation accuracy when synthetic echoes are used to augment existing datasets, demonstrating potential for more robust and clinically relevant ML models.

Conclusion: The synthetic data generation approach enhances clinical diagnosis accuracy and has potential to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications for medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Conclusion: Tabular foundational models show strong potential for advancing longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation

patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable visual exploration of asymmetric relationships between elements from different domains in co-occurrence data, which is common in many real-world applications.

Method: Embed elements into two-dimensional latent spaces by maximizing mutual information to preserve dependency structure. Extends to multiple domains using total correlation. Uses color-coding based on conditional probabilities for inter-domain visualization.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on adjective-noun, NeurIPS, and subject-verb-object datasets, showing effective intra- and inter-domain relationship visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective way to visualize asymmetric relationships in co-occurrence data across heterogeneous domains, enabling interactive exploration of complex dependencies.

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

*Victoria Yan,Honor Chotkowski,Fengran Wang,Alex Fedorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using GPT-4o models with advanced prompting strategies can generate synthetic normative data for cognitive tests, effectively distinguishing diagnostic groups and capturing demographic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional normative data collection for cognitive assessments is costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, creating barriers for developing new image-based cognitive tests.

Method: Used GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini with naive and advanced prompting strategies to generate synthetic responses for image-based cognitive tests like the "Cookie Theft" task. Evaluated using embedding analysis, BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.

Result: Advanced prompting produced responses that better distinguished diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity. BERTScore was most reliable for contextual similarity, while BLEU was less effective for creative outputs. LLM-as-a-judge showed promising validation results.

Conclusion: Generative multimodal LLMs with refined prompting can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data, enabling development of novel image-based cognitive assessments without traditional limitations.

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiKMiX dynamically adjusts data mixture during language model pre-training using Group Influence metric, achieving better performance with less computation than static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static data mixing strategies are suboptimal because language models' learning preferences for different data domains change dynamically throughout training, but efficiently observing these evolving preferences remains challenging.

Method: Proposes TiKMiX with Group Influence metric to evaluate data domain impact, formulated as optimal distribution search. Two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization and TiKMiX-M using regression model to predict superior mixture.

Result: TiKMiX-D outperforms REGMIX with only 20% computational resources. TiKMiX-M achieves average 2% performance gain across 9 downstream benchmarks. Models trained on up to 1 trillion tokens show preferences evolve with training progress and scale.

Conclusion: Dynamically adjusting data mixture based on Group Influence significantly improves performance by addressing underdigestion issues of static ratios, demonstrating the importance of adaptive data mixing strategies.

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face quadratic complexity issues with attention computation as sequence length increases. SSMs offer a promising alternative with better computational complexity, making it important to understand their GPU requirements and behavior for future hardware design.

Method: The researchers constructed a workload suite with representative Mamba-based SSM models spanning different architectures, then used this suite to analyze architectural implications and behavior during GPU training.

Result: The study provides characterization of Mamba-based SSM behavior on GPUs during training, revealing insights about computational patterns and requirements that differ from traditional transformer models.

Conclusion: The analysis sheds light on potential GPU microarchitectural optimizations needed to continue scaling performance for Mamba-based SSMs, providing guidance for future hardware design to better support these emerging models.

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead and robust overfitting issues in adversarial training for large backbone models, making foundation models more trustworthy.

Method: Propose a new adapter-based approach for efficient adversarial training directly in the feature space, improving inner-loop convergence quality.

Result: Significantly increases computational efficiency, improves model accuracy, and generalizes adversarial robustness to unseen attacks across different backbone architectures.

Conclusion: The adapter-based approach effectively solves both computational overhead and robust overfitting problems simultaneously, enabling scalable adversarial training for foundation models.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

TL;DR: Proposes unlearning-as-ablation as a test to determine if LLMs generate new scientific knowledge vs. merely remix memorized content, by systematically removing target results and evaluating re-derivation capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the epistemic question of whether AI models truly generate new scientific knowledge or just remix memorized fragments, and to create falsifiable tests for constructive scientific discovery.

Method: Unlearning-as-ablation: systematically removes target results and their entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, entailments), then evaluates if models can re-derive results from permitted axioms and tools.

Result: Conceptual framework proposed rather than empirical results - success would indicate genuine generative capability, failure exposes current limits of AI scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Unlearning-as-ablation provides a principled framework to map AI's true scientific discovery capabilities and could serve as next-generation benchmarks to distinguish between recall and constructive generation.

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between memorization and generalization in diffusion models is crucial for addressing real-world concerns like copyright infringement and data privacy in practical deployments.

Method: Introduces a scientific laboratory with synthetic and natural image-like data, theoretically characterizes a crossover point in training loss between memorizing and generalizing models, and validates through carefully-designed experiments.

Result: The theory successfully predicts a phase transition in diffusion models where memorization becomes predominant at a critical model underparameterization size, validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: Provides an analytically tractable framework for predicting memorization behavior in diffusion models, enabling future theoretical and empirical investigations into data reproduction vs. novel generation capabilities.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Over-the-air federated learning enables large-scale client participation by using analog signal transmission, offering enhanced privacy, channel fading mitigation, and improved convergence despite channel distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces communication bottlenecks when supporting large numbers of clients. Over-the-air computations can alleviate these constraints but introduce channel-induced distortions that need theoretical analysis.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze over-the-air federated learning performance in large-scale client scenarios, examining privacy leakage, channel effects, and convergence properties.

Result: Three key advantages identified: (1) Enhanced privacy through reduced mutual information between client gradients and server aggregates, (2) Channel hardening eliminates small-scale fading effects, (3) Improved convergence from reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors.

Conclusion: Over-the-air model training is a viable approach for federated learning in large-scale networks, with theoretical insights validated through extensive experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Motivation: Machine learning performs well with complete data but real-world data collection faces uncertainties leading to data sparsity, requiring robust solutions

Method: Three-module approach: 1) Gaussian Copula for data complementation to eliminate sparsity, 2) Five individual ML models for predictions, 3) Adaptive ensemble for final weighted-sum result

Result: Experiments demonstrated the model's robustness in handling sparse data scenarios

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive ensemble learning framework with Gaussian Copula effectively addresses data sparsity issues in load forecasting, providing robust performance

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is capable of accurate Load Forecasting from complete

it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML
models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

Conclusion: SSD provides an effective lightweight decoding-time approach for enhancing LLM safety against jailbreak attacks without compromising utility or performance.

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

### [479] [Randomly Removing 50% of Dimensions in Text Embeddings has Minimal Impact on Retrieval and Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17744)
*Sotaro Takeshita,Yurina Takeshita,Daniel Ruffinelli,Simone Paolo Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Truncating up to 50% of text embedding dimensions causes only minor performance drops (<10%) across 6 encoders and 26 tasks, contrary to expectations about representation space utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the surprising impact of embedding truncation on performance and investigate why removing dimensions doesn't significantly harm downstream tasks.

Method: Studied 6 state-of-the-art text encoders across 26 downstream tasks, randomly removing embedding dimensions and analyzing performance impact on retrieval and classification tasks.

Result: Removing up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in less than 10% performance drop. Many uniformly distributed dimensions actually improve performance when removed.

Conclusion: The phenomenon of minimal performance degradation from embedding truncation is not due to ineffective space usage but rather the presence of many uniformly distributed dimensions that can be removed without harm, extending to LLM token prediction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

*Alessio Arcudi,Davide Sartor,Alberto Sinigaglia,Vincent Fran√ßois-Lavet,Gian Antonio Susto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MANGO is a hierarchical RL framework that uses nested abstraction layers with options to improve sample efficiency and generalization in sparse reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of long-term sparse reward environments in reinforcement learning by creating modular, reusable abstractions.

Method: Decomposes tasks into multiple abstraction layers with abstract state spaces, employs nested options as macro-actions, uses intra-layer policies for transitions, and integrates task-specific reward functions.

Result: Substantial improvements in sample efficiency and generalization capabilities in procedurally-generated grid environments compared to standard RL methods, with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: MANGO provides an effective hierarchical framework for sparse reward problems with transparent decision-making, with future work focusing on automated abstraction discovery and adaptation to continuous environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

TL;DR: SuperGen is a training-free tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation that reduces memory and computational costs while maintaining quality through adaptive caching and parallel processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for high-quality 2K/4K video content is increasing, but existing diffusion models struggle with ultra-high-resolution generation due to excessive computational and memory requirements and the need for re-training.

Method: SuperGen uses a novel training-free tiling approach with adaptive region-aware caching to exploit redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions, combined with cache-guided tile parallelism for enhanced throughput.

Result: Evaluations show SuperGen achieves maximum performance gains while maintaining high output quality across various benchmarks, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational complexity.

Conclusion: SuperGen provides an efficient solution for ultra-high-resolution video generation without additional training efforts, making high-quality content generation more accessible and computationally feasible.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

*Jelke Wibbeke,Nico Sch√∂nfisch,Sebastian Rohjans,Andreas Rauh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic analysis reveals significant inconsistencies among regression calibration metrics, with many producing conflicting results on the same data, potentially enabling cherry-picking. ENCE and CWC identified as most reliable metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven models in safety-critical applications require reliable uncertainty estimates (calibration), but existing calibration metrics vary widely in definitions, assumptions, and scales, making comparisons difficult and raising concerns about whether recalibration improvements generalize across different calibration notions.

Method: Systematically extracted and categorized regression calibration metrics from literature, conducted controlled experiments using real-world, synthetic, and artificially miscalibrated data to benchmark metrics independently of specific modeling methods or recalibration approaches.

Result: Calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results, with substantial inconsistencies where many metrics disagree in evaluating the same recalibration result and some indicate contradictory conclusions. Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and Coverage Width-based Criterion (CWC) performed as the most dependable metrics.

Conclusion: Metric selection plays a critical role in calibration research due to the significant inconsistencies among existing metrics. Researchers should be cautious about potential cherry-picking and consider using more reliable metrics like ENCE and CWC for consistent evaluation.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Puzzle is a genetic algorithm-based system that schedules multiple deep learning networks on heterogeneous mobile processors by partitioning networks into subgraphs, achieving 3.7x higher request frequency compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing deep learning workload scheduling: single-model focus instead of multi-model scenarios, overlooking hardware/software configuration variations, and inaccurate execution time estimation on modern mobile devices with heterogeneous accelerators.

Method: Genetic algorithm with three chromosome types for partition/mapping/priority exploration, device-in-the-loop profiling for accurate execution time estimation, and network partitioning into multiple subgraphs for heterogeneous processor scheduling.

Result: Puzzle supports 3.7x and 2.2x higher request frequency on average compared to NPU Only and Best Mapping baselines respectively, while satisfying equivalent real-time requirements in evaluations with nine state-of-the-art networks.

Conclusion: The proposed genetic algorithm-based methodology effectively addresses multi-model scheduling challenges on heterogeneous mobile processors, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing heuristic approaches while maintaining real-time constraints.

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proximal SFT (PSFT) is a new fine-tuning method that prevents capability deterioration in foundation models by incorporating trust-region constraints inspired by RL optimization techniques, improving generalization while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning often causes poor generalization and deterioration of prior capabilities when adapting foundation models to new tasks or domains.

Method: Proposed Proximal SFT (PSFT) inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) from reinforcement learning. Views SFT as a special case of policy gradient methods with constant positive advantages and incorporates trust-region benefits to constrain policy drift.

Result: PSFT matches SFT performance in-domain, outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged training without entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation for subsequent optimization stages.

Conclusion: PSFT effectively stabilizes optimization and improves generalization in supervised fine-tuning while maintaining competitive performance, making it a superior alternative to standard SFT for foundation model adaptation.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by
jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes limitations of softmax normalization in attention mechanisms, showing that as more tokens are selected, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines and converges toward uniform selection, with gradient sensitivity issues at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations and theoretical foundations of normalization in attention mechanisms, particularly understanding the model's selective ability and geometric separation in token selection under softmax scaling.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for analyzing attention mechanisms, conducted experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model to empirically validate theoretical results, and analyzed distance bounds and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling.

Result: Demonstrated that increasing the number of selected tokens reduces the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens, leading to uniform selection patterns. Also identified gradient sensitivity challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of softmax-based attention mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures to address the identified limitations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a statistical framework analyzing MPNN performance limitations through signal-to-noise ratio, linking heterophily and structural bottlenecks to higher-order homophily, and proposes BRIDGE - a graph rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification across all homophily regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message passing neural networks suffer from performance limitations under heterophily and structural bottlenecks in graphs, requiring a unified framework to understand and address these issues.

Method: Developed a statistical framework using signal-to-noise ratio analysis, proved sensitivity bounds through higher-order homophily, analyzed graph ensembles for bottleneck decomposition, and created BRIDGE - a graph ensemble-based rewiring algorithm.

Result: Achieved near-perfect classification accuracy across all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, eliminating the "mid-homophily pitfall" where MPNNs typically struggle.

Conclusion: The framework provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance and effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph modification, with BRIDGE surpassing current standard rewiring techniques.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL training faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation and network latency issues that cause high variance in importance sampling.

Method: Proposed HeteroRL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, and Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO) which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism.

Result: GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction theoretically and maintains superior stability with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays compared to methods like GRPO.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes despite network delays.

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Motivation: Existing air quality prediction models suffer from low accuracy, slow real-time updates, and lagging results, necessitating a more efficient and accurate spatiotemporal prediction approach.

Method: Combines multi-head attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks in spatiotemporal blocks, with adaptive graph structure learning module and auxiliary task learning module to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and spatial relationships between monitoring points.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art prediction models in both short-term and long-term predictions on benchmark and novel Mete-air datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Ada-TransGNN model effectively addresses air quality prediction challenges by integrating global spatial semantics and temporal behavior through adaptive graph learning and auxiliary tasks, achieving superior prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access and resource allocation, but existing methods struggle to separate predictable patterns from noise due to unique spectrum data characteristics.

Method: Proposes SFFP framework with three modules: adaptive fractional Fourier transform to transform data into optimal domain, adaptive filtering to suppress noise while preserving predictive features, and complex-valued neural network for prediction.

Result: Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that SFFP outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Conclusion: The SFFP framework effectively addresses the challenge of separating predictable patterns from noise in spectrum data through domain transformation and adaptive filtering, demonstrating superior prediction performance.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Motivation: Address optimizer inefficiencies in PEFT methods like LoRA, particularly the basis redundancy in the B matrix when using AdamW, which fundamentally limits performance in LLM fine-tuning.

Method: Optimize the B matrix on the Stiefel manifold with explicit orthogonality constraints to achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank, enhancing parameter efficiency and representational capacity.

Result: The Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: Geometric constraints are key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning, providing a more efficient alternative to traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across

TL;DR: A unified learning-based method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets by injecting artificial errors and framing detection as an instance segmentation problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label errors in supervised learning datasets reduce model performance, create biased benchmarks, and lower accuracy. Current methods are task-specific and not learning-based, creating a research gap for unified error detection across multiple computer vision tasks.

Method: Inject different types of label errors into ground truth data, then frame label error detection across all tasks as an instance segmentation problem using composite input. The approach learns to detect errors by creating them.

Result: Compared with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches on simulated errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. Also conducted generalization study on real-world errors and released 459 real label errors found in Cityscapes dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides a unified solution for label error detection across multiple computer vision tasks, outperforming task-specific approaches and demonstrating effectiveness on both simulated and real-world label errors.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Existing methods use static metrics and rigid global alignment, leading to consensus distortion and reduced model adaptability.

Method: FedMate implements bilateral optimization: Server-side constructs dynamic global prototype with weights calibrated by sample size, current parameters, and future prediction, then fine-tunes category-wise classifier. Client-side uses complementary classification fusion for merit-based discrimination training and cost-aware feature transmission to balance performance and communication efficiency.

Result: Experiments on five datasets of varying complexity show FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Semantic segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate real-world scalability.

Conclusion: FedMate effectively addresses federated learning heterogeneity through its bilateral optimization approach, achieving superior performance in balancing generalization and personalization while maintaining communication efficiency and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

### [494] [Generative Feature Imputing - A Technique for Error-resilient Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17957)
*Jianhao Huang,Qunsong Zeng,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes generative feature imputing framework for robust semantic communication, using spatial error concentration, diffusion-based feature reconstruction, and semantic-aware power allocation to handle transmission errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communication faces challenges in robustness against transmission errors that can distort semantically critical content when deployed over digital systems.

Method: Three key techniques: 1) Spatial error concentration packetization strategy, 2) Generative feature imputing using diffusion models to reconstruct missing features, 3) Semantic-aware power allocation for unequal error protection.

Result: Outperforms conventional approaches like DJSCC and JPEG2000 under block fading conditions, achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower LPIPS scores.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses robustness challenges in semantic communication systems through innovative error handling and power allocation techniques.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

### [495] [Topology Aware Neural Interpolation of Scalar Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17995)
*Mohamed Kissi,Keanu Sisouk,Joshua A. Levine,Julien Tierny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural network approach for topology-aware interpolation of time-varying scalar fields using persistence diagrams and keyframes to estimate missing data at non-keyframe time steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpolating time-varying scalar fields with topological accuracy, particularly when only sparse temporal samples (keyframes) are available, while preserving topological features throughout the interpolation process.

Method: Uses a neural architecture that learns the relationship between time values and corresponding scalar fields from keyframe examples, augmented with topological losses that exploit input persistence diagrams to improve both geometric and topological reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on 2D and 3D time-varying datasets demonstrate superior performance in both data fitting and topological accuracy compared to reference interpolation schemes, with instantaneous output generation at query time.

Conclusion: The proposed neural approach effectively combines geometric and topological constraints to produce high-quality interpolations of time-varying scalar fields, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining computational efficiency through single network propagation.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

### [496] [A Novel Framework for Uncertainty Quantification via Proper Scores for Classification and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18001)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for uncertainty quantification in ML using proper scores, applicable across regression, classification, and generative tasks with theoretical foundations and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy ML but current approaches are problem-specific and lack transferability. Proper scores provide a general framework applicable to various ML tasks.

Method: Uses proper scores and functional Bregman divergences for bias-variance decomposition. Applies kernel scores for generative model evaluation, introduces proper calibration errors, and develops novel estimators for calibration assessment.

Result: Developed a general uncertainty quantification framework, outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in LLM uncertainty estimation, and provided fine-grained evaluation methods for generative image models.

Conclusion: Proper scores offer a unified framework for uncertainty quantification across diverse ML tasks, enabling better model evaluation, calibration assessment, and trustworthy AI applications.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes which components of adversarial training methods most effectively improve DNN robustness by comparing a simple margin-maximizing loss modification approach with a more complex state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) using VGG-16 on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and while various adversarial training techniques exist, it's unclear which specific components contribute most to improved robustness through margin maximization in the input space.

Method: Systematic comparison of two margin-maximizing adversarial training methods: a simple loss function modification approach and a more complex Dynamics-Aware Robust Training method. Used VGG-16 model on CIFAR-10 dataset, isolating individual components to evaluate their impact under adversarial attacks including AutoAttack and PGD.

Result: The analysis revealed which specific elements from the adversarial training methods most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing empirical evidence on component effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the most impactful components of adversarial training techniques for improving DNN robustness, offering guidance for designing more effective robust neural networks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Result: Significantly optimized model size and inference latency while maintaining high accuracy, with enhanced robustness across diverse planetary conditions.

Conclusion: Provides computationally efficient and reliable crater detection critical for autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration missions.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

*Zilong Cao,Hai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel differentially private linear regression method that uses public second-moment matrix to transform private data, improving accuracy and robustness compared to standard SSP-OLSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DP methods add noise based solely on private data, which significantly degrades utility. The paper aims to enhance utility by leveraging public data information.

Method: Proposes transforming private data using public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, which yields better condition number and improves OLSE accuracy and robustness under unbounded data assumption.

Result: Theoretical error bounds show improved robustness and accuracy compared to standard SSP-OLSE. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate utility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully leverages public data to enhance differentially private linear regression, providing better utility while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust change-point detection method for streaming time series on Riemannian manifolds using Huber's robust centroid versus classical Karcher mean comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series on manifolds, particularly the sensitivity to step size tuning in center-of-mass monitoring approaches.

Method: Leverages robust centroid estimation from M-estimation theory, comparing classical Karcher mean (change-sensitive) with Huber's function-based centroid (change-robust) to define a test statistic. Uses stochastic Riemannian optimization for efficient centroid estimation.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world data across two representative manifolds demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed robust centroid comparison approach provides an effective and less sensitive method for change-point detection in streaming manifold data, overcoming step size tuning issues in traditional approaches.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message-passing GNNs face scaling and efficiency challenges with large complex meshes. Existing enhancements like multigrid and K-hop aggregation add complexity without thorough investigation.

Method: Proposed Graph Transformer with adjacency matrix as attention mask, incorporating Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention for extended receptive fields. Evaluated model size, adjacency augmentations, positional encoding, and K-hop configurations on 3D CFD datasets.

Result: Models scale to meshes with 300k nodes and 3M edges. Smallest model matches MeshGraphNet performance while being 7x faster and 6x smaller. Largest model surpasses previous SOTA by 38.8% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by 52% on all-rollout RMSE with similar training speed.

Conclusion: The proposed Graph Transformer architecture provides superior scalability and performance for physics simulation on large meshes, offering significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: Extends GNN theory to continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity, introducing continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test and CGNNs that maintain distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems like communication networks and molecular interactions evolve asynchronously and may disconnect, but existing GNN results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs with connected snapshots.

Method: Introduces continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, proves equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and develops continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions.

Result: Establishes theoretical foundation for CGNNs that can handle asynchronous, disconnected graphs while preserving the distinguishing power and universal approximation capabilities of traditional GNNs.

Conclusion: Provides both theoretical guarantees and practical design guidelines for processing continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity patterns using expressive CGNN architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGreed is a Byzantine-resilient aggregation strategy for federated learning that uses server-side reference data to select clients with minimal loss, without requiring assumptions about adversarial fraction and working well with non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address FL security concerns where clients may exhibit Byzantine attacks while preserving data privacy, particularly in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions.

Method: Orders clients' local model updates based on loss metrics evaluated against trusted server dataset, greedily selecting subset with minimal evaluation loss without assumptions about adversarial fraction.

Result: Significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines (Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, Multi-Krum) in various adversarial scenarios including label flipping and Gaussian noise attacks on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FedGreed provides effective Byzantine resilience with convergence guarantees and bounded optimality gaps, demonstrating superior performance in heterogeneous FL environments with adversarial clients.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

TL;DR: Proposes a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder for zero-day GNSS spoofing detection, achieving 97.71% accuracy without needing spoofed training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can cause severe navigation and timing disruptions. Existing supervised learning methods fail to detect novel, unseen attacks.

Method: Uses a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder trained only on authentic GNSS signals, leveraging tracking stage features for proactive detection before PNT computation. Focuses on static receivers vulnerable to time-push attacks.

Result: Achieved 97.71% average detection accuracy with 0.62% false negative rate. For sophisticated attacks: 98.23% accuracy with 1.85% false negative rate. Outperformed classical counterparts and existing methods.

Conclusion: The HQC-AE method effectively detects zero-day GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary platforms without requiring spoofed training data.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications in physics/chemistry often involve unknown heterogeneous noise structures, while traditional methods assume fixed/known noise characteristics.

Method: Combines conditional flow matching (simulation-free ODE-based) with Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly estimate posterior distributions and noise parameters.

Result: Proves EM updates converge to true noise parameters in population limit; numerical results demonstrate effectiveness for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: Flow matching embedded in EM framework provides effective solution for high-dimensional inference in mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems with unknown noise parameters.

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Method: Interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. Frozen blocks provide nonlinear memory at no optimization cost, while trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention.

Result: On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialized variants (Informer, Autoformer, PatchTST) with substantially lower compute. Reduces trainable parameters and wall-clock training time while maintaining inference complexity.

Conclusion: Embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction, demonstrating that hybrid approaches can achieve state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

*Riccardo Cappi,Paolo Frazzetto,Nicol√≤ Navarin,Alessandro Sperduti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares symbolic regression methods for discovering governing equations of dynamical systems on graphs, introducing a novel KAN adaptation that outperforms existing methods with better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack interpretability which hinders scientific discovery, especially for dynamical processes on networks where topological structure affects behavior.

Method: Comparative evaluation of sparse regression, MLP-based architectures, and a novel adaptation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs that leverages their inherent interpretability through learnable activation functions.

Result: Both MLP and KAN-based architectures successfully identified underlying symbolic equations, significantly surpassing existing baselines. KANs achieved this with greater parsimony and transparency.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical guide for researchers on trade-offs between model expressivity and interpretability, establishing neural-based architectures as viable for robust scientific discovery on complex systems.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prose is a 280M parameter transferable normalizing flow that enables zero-shot sampling of peptide conformations across different sequence lengths, outperforming traditional methods like molecular dynamics and sequential Monte Carlo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical sampling methods like molecular dynamics lack amortization - computational cost must be paid for each system. Learned samplers have shown limited transferability across different molecular systems.

Method: Developed Prose, a 280 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Uses importance sampling-based finetuning procedure.

Result: Achieves zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems with transferability across sequence length. Outperforms established methods like sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides.

Conclusion: Deep learning enables scalable and transferable samplers. Prose demonstrates the feasibility of amortized sampling methods that can generalize across different molecular systems while maintaining efficient likelihood evaluation.

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

*Nikolay Kutuzov,Makar Baderko,Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Daniel Bobrov,Maxim Mashtaler,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-stage method combining Multi-Instance Training, Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode to improve LLM training efficiency on heterogeneous hardware under dynamic workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DiLoCo fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads, leading to inefficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware resources in distributed LLM training.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Multi-Instance Training with parallel lightweight streams on individual nodes, 2) Adaptive Batched DiLoCo that dynamically adjusts local batch sizes, 3) Switch mode mechanism that introduces gradient accumulation when batch sizes exceed hardware limits.

Result: Improved throughput, reduced idle time, lower synchronization delays, and better convergence speed and system efficiency. Also provides theoretical estimate of communication requirements for full convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by better utilizing heterogeneous hardware resources and adapting to dynamic workloads, resulting in more efficient distributed LLM training.

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

### [511] [HypER: Hyperbolic Echo State Networks for Capturing Stretch-and-Fold Dynamics in Chaotic Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18196)
*Pradeep Singh,Sutirtha Ghosh,Ashutosh Kumar,Hrishit B P,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HypER introduces hyperbolic geometry to Echo State Networks, enabling longer chaotic time series predictions by better matching the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos through exponential distance decay in hyperbolic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Echo State Networks use Euclidean geometry that mismatches the chaotic dynamics structure, limiting prediction horizons beyond a few Lyapunov times due to exponential error growth.

Method: HypER uses neurons sampled in Poincare ball with connections decaying exponentially with hyperbolic distance, embedding negative curvature directly into latent space while preserving standard ESN features like sparsity and spectral-radius control.

Result: HypER consistently outperforms Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines on chaotic systems (Lorenz-63, Roessler, Chen-Ueta) and real-world benchmarks (heart-rate variability, sunspot numbers), with statistically significant gains in mean valid-prediction horizon over 30 runs.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embedding in reservoirs significantly extends chaotic prediction horizons by aligning reservoir geometry with Lyapunov directions, establishing a theoretical lower bound on state divergence that mirrors Lyapunov growth.

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

### [512] [Deep Learning and Matrix Completion-aided IoT Network Localization in the Outlier Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18225)
*Sunwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning and matrix completion approach for outlier-contaminated Euclidean distance matrix recovery in IoT network localization, with joint optimization of sensor coordinates and distance matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional localization techniques search over all matrices rather than restricting to Euclidean distance matrices, and need better outlier handling for IoT network localization.

Method: Express distance matrix D as function of sensor coordinates X, use deep neural network to jointly recover D and X, model outliers as sparse matrix L with regularization, and solve via alternating updates of X, D, and L.

Result: Numerical experiments show accurate recovery of sensor location information even with outliers present.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively handles outliers and accurately recovers sensor locations by restricting search to Euclidean distance matrices and using joint deep learning optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

*Chu-Cheng Lin,Daiyi Peng,Yifeng Lu,Ming Zhang,Eugene Ie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TACs is a framework that treats LLM workflows as typed probabilistic programs for gradient-based training, significantly outperforming prompt optimization methods on structured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM composition methods using discrete prompt optimization are brittle and struggle with formal compliance requirements for structured tasks.

Method: TACs recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs, treating the entire workflow as an unnormalized joint distribution to enable gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.

Result: TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving MGSM-SymPy from 57.1% to 75.9% for 27B model and MGSM from 1.6% to 27.3% for 7B model.

Conclusion: TACs provides a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems through typed probabilistic programming.

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

*Novin Shahroudi,Viacheslav Komisarenko,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to align predictive evaluation with downstream task utility using weighted scoring rules parameterized by neural networks, ensuring evaluation metrics reflect real-world impact rather than just predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prediction metrics often diverge from real-world downstream impact, creating an evaluation alignment problem where task-specific metrics are burdensome and cost-sensitive evaluations require known cost structures.

Method: Proposes data-driven learning of proxy evaluation functions aligned with downstream evaluation using weighted scoring rules parameterized by neural networks. Builds on proper scoring rule theory with transformations that preserve propriety.

Result: The framework enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks with complex or unknown weighting, demonstrated through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream utility in modular prediction systems, providing a scalable solution for evaluation alignment without requiring explicit cost structures.

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ano optimizer decouples direction and magnitude - uses momentum for directional smoothing but instantaneous gradient magnitudes for step size, improving robustness to noise while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like Adam and Adan degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates.

Method: Introduces Ano optimizer that separates direction (smoothed by momentum) from magnitude (using instantaneous gradients), plus Anolog variant with logarithmic momentum scheduling to remove sensitivity to momentum coefficient.

Result: Establishes non-convex convergence guarantees with rates similar to sign-based methods. Shows substantial gains in noisy/non-stationary regimes like reinforcement learning while remaining competitive on low-noise tasks like computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: Ano provides a robust optimizer design that handles noisy environments better than momentum-based methods while maintaining simplicity and competitive performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

*Katie Seaborn*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores how social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) can be applied to artificial social agents like robots and chatbots, arguing that while some human social models may apply, experts need to critically evaluate these applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of increasingly social machines and advanced AI agents embedded in daily life has created a need to understand whether and how these artificial agents can participate in social identity activities traditionally studied in human contexts.

Method: The author provides a primer on social identity approach (SIA) and extrapolates through case studies and imagined examples how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents, while acknowledging that not all human models will transfer.

Result: The analysis suggests that social identity theories can be meaningfully applied to artificial agents, but requires careful consideration of which human models and sub-theories are appropriate for machine contexts.

Conclusion: Given the emerging competence of social machines and human tendency to anthropomorphize them, experts should adopt a critical "uncanny killjoy" perspective to evaluate these applications carefully for our own benefit.

Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two
facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena.
SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one
another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an
understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour.
SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general
offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among
people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has
spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do
participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots
powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding
the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is
crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies
and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I
emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further
argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to
be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy,
for our own good.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Boltzina is a novel framework that combines Boltz-2's high binding affinity prediction accuracy with improved computational efficiency by using AutoDock Vina docking poses and omitting rate-limiting structure prediction steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational bottleneck of Boltz-2 (20 seconds per compound per GPU) which makes it impractical for large-scale virtual screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds, while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Method: Omit the rate-limiting structure prediction from Boltz-2's architecture and directly predict affinity from AutoDock Vina docking poses. Implement reduced recycling iterations and batch processing for speed optimization. Investigate multi-pose selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2.

Result: Boltzina achieves up to 11.8√ó faster processing while maintaining significantly higher screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Although performing below Boltz-2 in accuracy, it provides practical-scale screening capabilities with optimized accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Boltzina represents the first successful application of Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a pipeline that effectively balances accuracy and computational efficiency for large-scale virtual screening in drug discovery.

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional
molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations
in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely
high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20
seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale
screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study
proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy
while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both
accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from
Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina
docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show
that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher
screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,
Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling
iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose
selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,
presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to
application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply
Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a
pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

TL;DR: A framework for generating protein structures with target flexibility profiles using equivariant neural networks and conditional flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein generation methods are limited to static properties, but flexibility is crucial for functions like catalysis and molecular recognition.

Method: Proposes BackFlip (equivariant NN for predicting residue flexibility) and FliPS (SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model for generating backbones with target flexibility).

Result: Successfully generates novel and diverse protein backbones with desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: The framework enables protein design with controlled flexibility, overcoming limitations of static property generation approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have
enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties.
However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to
generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and
symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which
is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.
We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting
per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,
we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that
solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target
flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate
novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid proliferation of EEG foundation models has outpaced standardized evaluation benchmarks, complicating direct model comparisons and hindering systematic scientific progress, creating fragmentation and inefficiency.

Method: The authors curate diverse downstream tasks from canonical EEG paradigms with standardized processing, benchmark state-of-the-art foundation models, and perform qualitative analyses of learned representations within a unified open-source framework.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training, and neuropsychological priors contribute to enhanced model performance and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: EEG-FM-Bench provides a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, aiming to catalyze progress and guide development of more robust and generalizable EEG foundation models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly
advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from
large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has
outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which
complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific
progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures
genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce
EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and
standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions
are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets
from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and
evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark
prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive
baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we
perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights
into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive
experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction,
multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to
enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a
unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench
seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of

### [521] [How Do LLM-Generated Texts Impact Term-Based Retrieval Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17715)
*Wei Huang,Keping Bi,Yinqiong Cai,Wei Chen,Jiafeng Guo,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLM-generated content affects term-based retrieval models like BM25, finding that these models prioritize documents with term distributions matching queries rather than showing inherent bias toward machine-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-generated content floods the Internet, IR systems need to handle mixed human and machine-generated texts. Recent studies show neural retrievers prefer LLM content while term-based models favor human documents, requiring investigation into potential biases.

Method: Conducted linguistic analysis of LLM-generated texts, examining Zipf slopes, term specificity, and document-level diversity. Explored whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate source bias by analyzing document-term distribution alignment with queries.

Result: LLM-generated texts show smoother high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity, and greater document diversity. Term-based models prioritize documents whose term distributions match query distributions rather than showing inherent source bias.

Conclusion: Term-based retrieval models do not exhibit inherent bias toward LLM-generated content but instead favor documents with term distributions that align with queries. This provides foundation for understanding and addressing potential biases in IR systems handling mixed-source content.

Abstract: As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the
Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of
distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated
texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential
inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers
like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the
influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are
valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our
linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother
high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,
and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being
trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.
Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate
source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term
distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than
displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for
understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing
mixed-source content.

### [522] [Zero-shot Multimodal Document Retrieval via Cross-modal Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17079)
*Yejin Choi,Jaewoo Park,Janghan Yoon,Saejin Kim,Jaehyun Jeon,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PREMIR is a novel multimodal retrieval framework that uses MLLM-generated cross-modal pre-questions to improve retrieval performance on out-of-distribution documents, outperforming existing methods in closed-domain and multilingual settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal retrievers struggle with private documents in unseen domains or languages, as most documents are confined within corporate silos or owned by individuals, creating a gap in retrieval capabilities.

Method: Leverages MLLM to generate cross-modal pre-questions (preQs) before retrieval, expanding matching scope from single vector space embeddings to token-level matching using multiple complementary modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics in both closed-domain and multilingual settings.

Conclusion: PREMIR demonstrates effective cross-modal retrieval through pre-question generation, with ablation studies confirming component contributions and qualitative analysis showing robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded
information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from
complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most
documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate
silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or
languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective
framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal
pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers
that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from
multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token
level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on
out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual
settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We
confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies,
and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's
robustness in real world settings.

*Junyi Chen,Lu Chi,Siliang Xu,Shiwei Ran,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HLLM-Creator is a hierarchical LLM framework that efficiently generates personalized content by modeling user interests through clustering and pruning strategies, achieving significant improvements in ad performance with scalable deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC systems lack true personalization for individual users, while real-world applications like online advertising require content tailored to different user preferences for the same product's multiple selling points.

Method: Proposes HLLM-Creator with user clustering and user-ad-matching-prediction pruning for efficient inference, plus a chain-of-thought reasoning pipeline for data construction to handle limited personalized training data.

Result: Extensive experiments on Douyin Search Ads show effectiveness, with online A/B tests demonstrating a 0.476% increase on Adss metric, proving scalability for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: HLLM-Creator enables efficient and scalable personalized content generation for industrial applications, overcoming data scarcity and computational challenges through hierarchical modeling and intelligent pruning strategies.

Abstract: AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.
However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely
generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as
online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with
different users focusing on different features. This underscores the
significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective
personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately
modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation
process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency
and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.
Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice
complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We
propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest
modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination
of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is
employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce
computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale
deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on
chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific
creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized
data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of
our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin
Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a
0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient
personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are
available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.

*Hongtao Lin,Haoyu Chen,Jaewon Jang,Jiajing Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A method for conditional retrieval in recommendation systems that incorporates item-side information as conditions in queries, outperforming standard two-tower models and improving user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for conditional retrieval where retrieved items must be relevant to specific conditions (e.g., topics) while maintaining the efficiency of two-tower models.

Method: Uses the same training data as standard two-tower models but incorporates item-side information as conditions in the query, enabling feature interactions between user and condition.

Result: Outperforms standard two-tower models with filters on engagement metrics, retrieves highly relevant items, and when deployed at Pinterest, led to +0.26% weekly active users.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional retrieval method effectively bootstraps new use cases, improves recommendation relevance, and enhances user engagement in real-world applications.

Abstract: User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation
system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and
serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called
\textit{conditional retrieval}, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant
to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training
data as standard two tower models but incorporates item-side information as
conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use
cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition.
Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and
outperforms standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The
proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at
Pinterest and led to +0.26\% weekly active users.

*Qinyao Li,Xiaoyang Zheng,Qihang Zhao,Ke Xu,Zhongbo Sun,Chao Wang,Chenyi Lei,Han Li,Wenwu Ou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DiffusionGS is a novel personalized search ranking system that uses generative diffusion models to extract user intent from noisy historical behaviors by treating queries as intent anchors in a conditional denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized search methods under-exploit the explicit alignment between user queries (real-time intent) and historical behaviors, failing to capture dynamic interest shifts effectively.

Method: Proposes DiffusionGS with User-aware Denoising Layer (UDL) that formulates interest extraction as conditional denoising task, using queries as intent priors to guide diffusion process on behavioral sequences while incorporating user profiles.

Result: Extensive offline and online experiments show DiffusionGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalized search ranking.

Conclusion: The approach provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts by reframing queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, demonstrating superior performance in e-commerce and short-video platforms.

Abstract: Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and
revenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods
excel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical
behaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's
real-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In
this paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by
generative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit
intent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from
long-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest
extraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a
conditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware
representation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware
Denoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the
optimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing
queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method
provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.
Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of
DiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HyST is a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to handle complex queries over semi-structured tabular data, outperforming traditional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world recommendation systems need to handle user queries that combine both structured constraints (category, attributes) and unstructured preferences (descriptions, reviews), requiring a hybrid approach that traditional methods struggle with.

Method: HyST uses LLMs to extract attribute-level constraints from natural language queries and applies them as metadata filters, while processing remaining unstructured components through embedding-based semantic search.

Result: Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms traditional baselines, demonstrating improved retrieval precision through structured filtering.

Conclusion: HyST provides a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries by effectively combining structured filtering with semantic search, highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches in recommendation systems.

Abstract: User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured
constraints (e.g., category, attributes) with unstructured preferences (e.g.,
product descriptions or reviews). We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over
Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines
LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support
complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts
attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models
(LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining
unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a
semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional
baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving
retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world
user queries.

*Hung-Chun Hsu,Yuan-Ching Kuo,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Szu-Wei Fu,Hanrong Ye,Hongxu Yin,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Ming-Feng Tsai,Chuan-Ju Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel framework that applies test-time scaling to conversational multimodal product retrieval, using test-time reranking to improve retrieval accuracy and alignment with evolving user intent in multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional product retrieval systems struggle with complex multi-turn interactions, and existing multimodal generative retrieval methods are tailored for single-turn scenarios. Test-time scaling shows promise but requires well-defined problem spaces and self-correction abilities that are lacking in conversational product search.

Method: Proposes a framework combining generative retriever with test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism to improve retrieval accuracy and better align results with evolving user intent throughout multi-turn dialogues.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.

Conclusion: The proposed test-time scaling framework effectively addresses the challenges of conversational multimodal product retrieval, significantly improving performance in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional
product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.
Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown
promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios
and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn
dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as
a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance
through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically
relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical
reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are
rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are
often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding
responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational
multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,
further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves
retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent
throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent
improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in
nDCG@1.

*Bin Tan,Wangyao Ge,Yidi Wang,Xin Liu,Jeff Burtoft,Hao Fan,Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PCR-CA is a novel framework that uses parallel codebook representations and contrastive alignment to improve CTR prediction for multiple-category apps, achieving significant performance gains in both offline and online testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps because conventional taxonomies cannot effectively capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization performance.

Method: The framework extracts multimodal embeddings, uses a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module to learn discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel, employs contrastive alignment loss at user and item levels, and uses dual-attention fusion to combine ID-based and semantic features.

Result: PCR-CA achieves +0.76% AUC improvement over baselines, +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps, +10.52% CTR lift, and +16.30% CVR improvement in online A/B testing.

Conclusion: The proposed PCR-CA framework effectively addresses the challenges of multiple-category app recommendation and has been successfully deployed on the Microsoft Store, demonstrating significant real-world performance improvements.

Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as
traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to
suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook
Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for
improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings
from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns
discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --
unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables
independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better
modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative
signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item
levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a
dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to
capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a
large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong
baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further
validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement
in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new
framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

### [529] [Analysis of Transferability Estimation Metrics for Surgical Phase Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16730)
*Prabhant Singh,Yiping Li,Yasmina Al Khalil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks three transferability estimation metrics (LogME, H-Score, TransRate) for surgical phase recognition, finding LogME with minimum per-subset aggregation aligns best with fine-tuning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical video analysis requires expert annotations that are time-consuming and costly, making it critical to identify the most suitable pre-trained model without full retraining.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark of three representative SITE metrics (LogME, H-Score, TransRate) on two diverse surgical datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo) for surgical phase recognition.

Result: LogME with minimum per-subset aggregation aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score has weak predictive power; TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Transferability estimates lose discriminative power when candidate models have similar performances.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for model selection and outlines future directions for domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking tools in surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine
learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited
labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are
especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained
model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging.
Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by
predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its
embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we
formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first
comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and
TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show
that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score,
aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak
predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation
studies show that when candidate models have similar performances,
transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance
of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with
practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward
domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking
tools.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning model predicts brain tumor contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI alone, outperforming expert radiologists with 83% accuracy and strong correlation to ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium contrast administration in MRI is not always desirable due to risks in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or pediatric patients, creating need for alternative enhancement detection methods.

Method: Trained deep learning models (nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) on 11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images to predict and segment enhancing tumor.

Result: Best model achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5% sensitivity, 74.4% specificity in tumor detection, with strong enhancement volume correlation (R2 0.859). Outperformed expert radiologists (69.8% accuracy). 76.8% of patients had acceptable detection (Dice >0.3).

Conclusion: Deep learning can identify contrast-enhancing brain tumors from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant performance, showing promise as screening tools to reduce gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging.

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and
post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such
as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We
aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain
tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled
11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and
paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma,
meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models
(nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing
tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images.
Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level
detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were
compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected
patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5%
sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement
volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model
outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9%
sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3
(acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had
Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify
contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant
performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce
gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate
clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-modality imaging methods fail to capture complex anatomical and pathological features of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors, necessitating a multi-modality approach for better segmentation accuracy.

Method: Align-Disentangle-Fusion mechanism with multi-scale distribution alignment across transformer layers, progressive feature disentanglement strategy, and disentangle-aware contrastive learning to separate modality-specific and shared features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches consistently across multiple datasets, achieving superior accuracy in diverse clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modality representation learning framework effectively integrates WLI and NBI imaging through advanced alignment and disentanglement techniques, significantly enhancing tumor segmentation performance for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors is crucial for precise
diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, traditional
single-modality imaging methods often fall short of capturing the complex
anatomical and pathological features of these tumors. In this study, we present
an innovative multi-modality representation learning framework based on the
`Align-Disentangle-Fusion' mechanism that seamlessly integrates 2D White Light
Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) pairs to enhance segmentation
performance. A cornerstone of our approach is multi-scale distribution
alignment, which mitigates modality discrepancies by aligning features across
multiple transformer layers. Furthermore, a progressive feature disentanglement
strategy is developed with the designed preliminary disentanglement and
disentangle-aware contrastive learning to effectively separate
modality-specific and shared features, enabling robust multimodal contrastive
learning and efficient semantic fusion. Comprehensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving superior accuracy across diverse real clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: First bridge diffusion model for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CT angiography from non-contrast CT scans, eliminating need for contrast agents while maintaining 3D anatomical integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrast agents in CT imaging pose risks like nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions. Synthetic contrast-enhanced imaging would improve patient safety, accessibility, and reduce healthcare costs.

Method: Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM) that maintains consistency across slices while operating in 2D. Comprehensive preprocessing including resampling, Symmetric Normalization registration, and dilated segmentation masks for aorta extraction.

Result: Created two datasets from Coltea-Lung dataset (aorta-only and aorta+heart). Method outperformed baselines in preserving vascular structures and enhancing contrast fidelity.

Conclusion: Proposed diffusion-based solution successfully generates synthetic contrast-enhanced CTA images without actual contrast administration, demonstrating effectiveness for clinical applications.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for
diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies.
However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like
reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT
angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be
transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing
healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based
solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT
scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while
maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis
methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating
in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation
under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration
using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated
segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create
two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and
another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of
anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both
datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures
while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Result: DCMIEDNet achieved superior performance at lower noise levels (PSNR: 32.921¬±2.350 dB for œÉ=10, 30.943¬±2.339 dB for œÉ=15), while CADTra showed greater robustness under severe noise (œÉ=25) with highest PSNR of 27.671¬±2.091 dB. All deep learning approaches significantly outperformed traditional methods by 5-8 dB.

Conclusion: The study establishes quantitative benchmarks for medical image denoising and provides insights into architecture-specific strengths for varying noise intensities, demonstrating the superiority of deep learning approaches over traditional methods.

Motivation: Automated segmentation of breast ultrasound images is crucial for precise lesion delineation but faces challenges from artifacts and dataset inconsistencies, requiring reliable uncertainty quantification for clinical trustworthiness.

Method: Modified Residual Encoder U-Net architecture with Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and their combination for epistemic uncertainty quantification. Dataset deduplication in BUSI dataset and evaluation on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on Breast-Lesion-USG dataset with in-distribution validation. Provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that signal low confidence regions. Performance declines and uncertainty increases observed in out-of-distribution evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective uncertainty modeling for trustworthy clinical deployment but highlights the persistent challenge of domain shift in medical imaging, emphasizing the importance of integrated uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of BUS images is important for precise lesion
delineation and tumor characterization, but is challenged by inherent artifacts
and dataset inconsistencies. In this work, we evaluate the use of a modified
Residual Encoder U-Net for breast ultrasound segmentation, with a focus on
uncertainty quantification. We identify and correct for data duplication in the
BUSI dataset, and use a deduplicated subset for more reliable estimates of
generalization performance. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified using Monte
Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and their combination. Models are benchmarked on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to demonstrate how they
generalize to unseen cross-domain data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation accuracy on the Breast-Lesion-USG dataset with in-distribution
validation, and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that effectively
signal regions of low model confidence. Performance declines and increased
uncertainty observed in out-of-distribution evaluation highlight the persistent
challenge of domain shift in medical imaging, and the importance of integrated
uncertainty modeling for trustworthy clinical deployment. \footnote{Code

### [536] [TuningIQA: Fine-Grained Blind Image Quality Assessment for Livestreaming Camera Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17965)
*Xiangfei Sheng,Zhichao Duan,Xiaofeng Pan,Yipo Huang,Zhichao Yang,Pengfei Chen,Leida Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A new fine-grained blind image quality assessment (BIQA) method called TuningIQA is proposed for livestreaming camera tuning, along with a comprehensive dataset FGLive-10K containing 10K+ images with multi-attribute annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA models only provide coarse-grained quality scores, which are insufficient for precise camera parameter tuning in livestreaming applications that require fine-grained perceptual guidance.

Method: Created FGLive-10K dataset with 10,185 high-resolution images across diverse livestreaming scenarios, featuring 50K+ multi-attribute annotations. Developed TuningIQA with human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter fusion.

Result: TuningIQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance for livestreaming camera tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained BIQA approach effectively bridges the gap for precise camera parameter optimization in livestreaming applications, providing detailed perceptual guidance beyond traditional coarse quality scores.

Abstract: Livestreaming has become increasingly prevalent in modern visual
communication, where automatic camera quality tuning is essential for
delivering superior user Quality of Experience (QoE). Such tuning requires
accurate blind image quality assessment (BIQA) to guide parameter optimization
decisions. Unfortunately, the existing BIQA models typically only predict an
overall coarse-grained quality score, which cannot provide fine-grained
perceptual guidance for precise camera parameter tuning. To bridge this gap, we
first establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database
containing 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera
parameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios. The dataset
features 50,925 multi-attribute quality annotations and 19,234 fine-grained
pairwise preference annotations. Based on FGLive-10K, we further develop
TuningIQA, a fine-grained BIQA metric for livestreaming camera tuning, which
integrates human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter
fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that TuningIQA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score
regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance
when deployed for livestreaming camera tuning.

*Yunyong Ko,Da Eun Lee,Song Kyung Yu,Sang-Wook Kim*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: LINCOLN is a method for learning high-order dynamics in real-world networks that captures both short-term structural/temporal influences and long-term periodic patterns through bi-interactional hyperedge encoding, periodic time injection, and intermediate node representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world networks exhibit high-order relationships that evolve over time, with two key characteristics: short-term structural/temporal influences between relations and long-term periodic reappearance of patterns.

Method: LINCOLN uses three main components: (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection, and (3) intermediate node representation for long-term patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments show that LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in dynamic hyperedge prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed LINCOLN method effectively captures both short-term and long-term high-order dynamics in evolving networks, demonstrating superior performance in predicting dynamic hyperedges compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they
evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a
range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important
characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order
relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other
relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In
this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of
reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for
short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node
representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that
LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge
prediction task.

### [538] [Equinox: Holistic Fair Scheduling in Serving Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16646)
*Zhixiang Wei,James Yen,Jingyi Chen,Ziyang Zhang,Zhibai Huang,Chen Chen,Xingzi Yu,Yicheng Gu,Chenggang Wu,Yun Wang,Mingyuan Xia,Jie Wu,Hao Wang,Zhengwei Qi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Equinox introduces a dual-counter fairness framework with predictive scheduling to balance user QoS and resource efficiency in LLM serving, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems face scheduling paradoxes where fairness metrics are only available post-execution, making proactive fairness-aware scheduling challenging.

Method: Uses deterministic Mixture of Prediction Experts (MoPE) to predict latency, output tokens, throughput, and GPU utilization, enabling calculation of a unified Holistic Fairness score for proactive scheduling.

Result: Achieves 1.3√ó higher throughput, 60% lower time-to-first-token latency, 13% higher fairness versus VTC while maintaining 94% GPU utilization across heterogeneous platforms.

Conclusion: Equinox successfully addresses the scheduling paradox through predictive fairness-aware scheduling, demonstrating significant improvements in both user experience and resource efficiency.

Abstract: We address the limitations of current LLM serving with a dual-counter
framework separating user and operator perspectives. The User Fairness Counter
measures quality of service via weighted tokens and latency; the Resource
Fairness Counter measures operational efficiency through throughput and GPU
utilization. Since these metrics are only available post-execution, creating a
scheduling paradox, we introduce a deterministic Mixture of Prediction Experts
(MoPE) framework to predict user-perceived latency, output tokens, throughput,
and GPU utilization. These predictions enable calculation of a unified Holistic
Fairness score that balances both counters through tunable parameters for
proactive fairness-aware scheduling. We implement this in Equinox, an
open-source system with other optimizations like adaptive batching, and
stall-free scheduling. Evaluations on production traces (ShareGPT, LMSYS) and
synthetic workloads demonstrate Equinox achieves up to $1.3\times$ higher
throughput, 60\% lower time-to-first-token latency, and 13\% higher fairness
versus VTC while maintaining 94\% GPU utilization, proving fairness under
bounded discrepancy across heterogeneous platforms.

TL;DR: Bine trees improve communication locality for collective operations on large HPC systems by reducing global-link traffic by up to 33% while maintaining algorithm generality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication locality is critical for performance on oversubscribed HPC networks where nodes have strong internal connectivity but sparse global connections.

Method: Developed Bine (binomial negabinary) trees, a family of collective algorithms that optimize communication patterns to reduce global-link usage while preserving the generality of binomial trees and butterflies.

Result: Implemented eight Bine-based collectives and evaluated on four supercomputer topologies (Dragonfly, Dragonfly+, oversubscribed fat-tree, torus), achieving up to 5x speedups and consistent reductions in global-link traffic across various vector sizes and node counts.

Conclusion: Bine trees effectively improve communication locality and performance for collective operations on diverse large-scale HPC network topologies by significantly reducing global-link traffic while maintaining algorithm flexibility.

Abstract: Communication locality plays a key role in the performance of collective
operations on large HPC systems, especially on oversubscribed networks where
groups of nodes are fully connected internally but sparsely linked through
global connections. We present Bine (binomial negabinary) trees, a family of
collective algorithms that improve communication locality. Bine trees maintain
the generality of binomial trees and butterflies while cutting global-link
traffic by up to 33%. We implement eight Bine-based collectives and evaluate
them on four large-scale supercomputers with Dragonfly, Dragonfly+,
oversubscribed fat-tree, and torus topologies, achieving up to 5x speedups and
consistent reductions in global-link traffic across different vector sizes and

### [540] [TokenLake: A Unified Segment-level Prefix Cache Pool for Fine-grained Elastic Long-Context LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17219)
*Bingyang Wu,Zili Zhang,Yinmin Zhong,Guanzhe Huang,Yibo Zhu,Xuanzhe Liu,Xin Jin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TokenLake is a unified segment-level prefix cache pool that improves cluster-level prefix caching through better load balancing, deduplication, and defragmentation, achieving significant throughput and hit rate improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prefix caching systems are tightly coupled with request scheduling, causing load imbalance, data redundancy, and memory fragmentation across instances. Memory pooling could help but existing systems cannot achieve low-latency pooling due to transferring increasingly longer prefix caches.

Method: TokenLake uses a declarative cache interface to expose query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations. It manages prefix cache at segment level with heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm and minimizes communication volume of query tensors and new caches.

Result: Evaluations show TokenLake improves throughput by up to 2.6√ó and 2.0√ó, and boosts hit rate by 2.0√ó and 2.1√ó compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions.

Conclusion: TokenLake enables elastic request scheduling without considering prefix cache management, providing better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation through its unified segment-level approach.

Abstract: Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests
with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are
tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and
computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy,
and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these
issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying
cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However,
because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer
prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory
pooling.
  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache
pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests'
query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for
efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix
cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm
to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation.
TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query
tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests
elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache
management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve
throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by
2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing
and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

TL;DR: A SLURM-based HPC architecture for scalable LLM inference that efficiently manages heterogeneous resources and supports up to 128 concurrent requests for small models with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying heterogeneous Large Language Models into scalable inference engines on multi-node HPC clusters, requiring efficient resource management for CPU, GPU, and memory allocations.

Method: Leverages SLURM for dynamic resource scheduling and containerized microservices, with REST API endpoints for single/bulk inference and advanced workflows like multi-step tribunal refinement. Tested with Llama models of various sizes (1B to 70B parameters).

Result: Small models (1B-3B) handle 128 concurrent requests with sub-50ms latency, while larger models (8B-70B) saturate at just 2 concurrent users with >2s latency. Shows minimal container/scheduling overhead and reliable scaling for both batch and interactive settings.

Conclusion: The architecture enables significantly more efficient, responsive, and fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures, demonstrating flexibility and robustness through real-world chatbot deployments with retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: This work elaborates on a High performance computing (HPC) architecture based
on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) [1] for deploying
heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs) into a scalable inference engine.
Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized
microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory
allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using
Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe
throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up
to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models,
saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more
than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer
Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and
bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal"
refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and
scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch
and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including
the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to
demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture. The obtained
results pave ways for significantly more efficient, responsive, and
fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures.

### [543] [Flash Sparse Attention: An Alternative Efficient Implementation of Native Sparse Attention Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18224)
*Ran Yan,Youhe Jiang,Binhang Yuan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Flash Sparse Attention (FSA) enables efficient sparse attention computation for modern LLMs with small GQA group sizes, achieving significant speed improvements over vanilla NSA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native Sparse Attention (NSA) has hardware-aligned sparse attention but its kernel implementation is only efficient with large GQA sizes, while modern LLMs use smaller GQA groups, limiting NSA's applicability.

Method: Proposed Flash Sparse Attention (FSA) with an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group sizes on modern GPUs.

Result: FSA achieves: (i) up to 3.5x kernel-level latency reduction (avg 1.6x), (ii) up to 1.25x end-to-end training speedup (avg 1.09x), (iii) up to 1.36x end-to-end prefill speedup (avg 1.11x) on state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: FSA successfully addresses the limitations of NSA by providing efficient sparse attention computation for modern LLMs with small GQA groups, delivering substantial performance gains while maintaining open-source availability.

Abstract: Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong
potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and
inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a
state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned
sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while
maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel
implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient
only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs
typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this
sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention
(FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA
computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group
sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and
on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$
and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art
LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end
prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and

*Hiroki Naito*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Analysis of public reactions to mandatory AI model transition shows strong emotional attachment, with Japanese users expressing more loss and attachment than English users who showed more anger and critique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional attachment to AI models affects user reactions during mandatory transitions and the implications for future AI governance.

Method: Collected 150 Japanese and English social media posts from August 8-9, 2025 and conducted qualitative analysis of emotional attachment expressions plus preliminary quantitative coding comparison.

Result: Japanese posts showed significantly higher emotional attachment (loss-oriented narratives) while English posts contained more anger, meta-critique, and memes. Emotional bonds can create rapid resistance that limits behavioral control.

Conclusion: Emotional attachment to AI can outpace governance capabilities, especially with physical AI robots. Policy recommendations include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive measurement of attachment thresholds.

Abstract: In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its
previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I
collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media
platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and
qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance.
Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting
person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives,
whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A
preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in
attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher
attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for
attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid,
large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral
control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become
widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to
enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy
options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive
measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent
emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine AI's multidimensional impact on human cognition and society, highlighting risks to critical thinking and intellectual diversity.

Method: Multidimensional analysis from cognitive, social, ethical, and philosophical perspectives examining AI's effects on thought processes.

Result: Identified cognitive offloading reduces intellectual engagement, algorithmic personalization creates filter bubbles and polarization, and manipulation mechanisms exploit cognitive biases.

Conclusion: AI poses significant risks to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, requiring educational, transparency, and governance measures to align AI with human interests.

Abstract: This research paper examines, from a multidimensional perspective (cognitive,
social, ethical, and philosophical), how AI is transforming human thought. It
highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental
functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical
thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter
bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization
of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of
algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated
disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the
question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its
ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses
to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues
(education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the
interests of humanity.

TL;DR: This study embeds pedagogical expertise into LLM architecture using a Multi-Agent System with KLI framework to generate higher quality educational content than typical teacher prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-12 educators use LLMs for instructional materials but current systems lack pedagogical depth and teachers struggle with prompt engineering to encode teaching expertise.

Method: Embedded Knowledge-Learning-Instruction framework into Multi-Agent System with three approaches: Single-Agent baseline, sequential role-based MAS, and collaborative MAS-CMD with conquer-merge discussion for generating math/science activities.

Result: While rubric scores showed small differences, teachers strongly preferred collaborative MAS-CMD activities, finding them more creative, contextually relevant, and classroom-ready.

Conclusion: Embedding pedagogical principles into LLM systems provides scalable path for creating high-quality educational content that teachers prefer over standard LLM outputs.

Abstract: K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create
instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent
content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is
twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the
most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of
pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second,
although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers
lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical
nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the
user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established
Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)
to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for
generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent
baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work
sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities
through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by
20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the
Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small,
often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the
qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture.
Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD,
describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and
classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into
LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational
content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disasters often exceed existing hazard models, revealing blind spots where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hinder effective response, highlighting the need for better situational awareness capabilities.

Method: A technology-process-people roadmap featuring real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, empowered teams, system-of-systems approach for federated data ownership, modular analytics, structured sense-making routines, and cognitive load safeguards.

Result: The approach transforms raw data into actionable insight, enabling multiple agencies to share timely updates while maintaining distinct operational models, and helps humans remain effective decision-makers amid data abundance.

Conclusion: SA should be elevated to a core disaster resilience objective rather than a peripheral add-on, with recommendations for developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration, and strengthening inclusive data governance.

Abstract: Disasters frequently exceed established hazard models, revealing blind spots
where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hamper effective response. This
perspective paper contends that situational awareness (SA)-the ability to
perceive, interpret, and project dynamic crisis conditions-is an often
overlooked yet vital capability for disaster resilience. While risk mitigation
measures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly
adaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging
failures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they
matter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how
real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams
collectively transform raw data into actionable insight. A system-of-systems
approach enables federated data ownership and modular analytics, so multiple
agencies can share timely updates without sacrificing their distinct
operational models. Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and
cognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid
data abundance. By framing SA as a socio-technical linchpin rather than a
peripheral add-on, this paper spotlights the urgency of elevating SA to a core
disaster resilience objective. We conclude with recommendations for further
research-developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration,
and strengthening inclusive data governance-to ensure that communities are
equipped to cope with both expected and unexpected crises.

Motivation: To understand how AI developers report risks compared to researcher-identified risks and real-world incidents, identifying gaps in current risk reporting practices.

Method: Analyzed 460,000 AI model cards from Hugging Face, extracted 3,000 unique risk mentions to build an AI Model Risk Catalog, and compared with MIT Risk Repository and AI Incident Database data.

Result: Developers focus on technical issues (bias, safety) while researchers emphasize social impacts. Both groups neglect fraud and manipulation risks that commonly occur in human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: Clearer, structured risk reporting is needed to help developers consider human-interaction and systemic risks early in AI design processes.

Abstract: We analyzed nearly 460,000 AI model cards from Hugging Face to examine how
developers report risks. From these, we extracted around 3,000 unique risk

risks identified by researchers in the MIT Risk Repository and with real-world
incidents from the AI Incident Database. Developers focused on technical issues
like bias and safety, while researchers emphasized broader social impacts. Both
groups paid little attention to fraud and manipulation, which are common harms
arising from how people interact with AI. Our findings show the need for

Method: Used two datasets (100 UK and 100 Indian interview transcripts), analyzed cross-cultural score differences, examined linguistic features, and performed controlled identity substitutions (names by gender, caste, region) within Indian dataset.

Result: Indian transcripts received consistently lower scores than UK transcripts even when anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features (sentence complexity, lexical diversity). Name substitutions alone did not yield statistically significant effects on evaluations.

Conclusion: Both linguistic and social dimensions must be evaluated in LLM-driven hiring systems, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in hiring, with large
language models (LLMs) having the potential to influence or even make hiring
decisions. However, this raises pressing concerns about bias, fairness, and
trust, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Despite their growing
role, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in
AI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a
systematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and
identity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK
and 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in
LLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts
receive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were
anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence
complexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity
substitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian
dataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield
statistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated
from other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings
underscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions
in LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive
design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring.

### [550] [Making AI Inevitable: Historical Perspective and the Problems of Predicting Long-Term Technological Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16692)
*Mark Fisher,John Severini*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper analyzes AI debates as philosophical disagreements about technological change rather than technical disputes, identifying transformationalists vs skeptics and their core disagreements on non-biological intelligence, time frames, and development trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that prominent debates about AI's future are fundamentally subjective, philosophical disagreements about technological change history and future rather than objective, material disagreements about the technologies themselves.

Method: Distinguishes two camps in the AGI debate: transformationalists (believe AI will transform society) and skeptics (doubt AI will meet high expectations), with strong/weak variants based on epistemic risk tolerance. Analyzes three core philosophical questions driving the disagreement.

Result: Identifies that transformationalists bear a heavier argumentative burden, their belief creates competitive pressures for first-mover advantage, and debates require broadening the concept of expertise beyond technical knowledge.

Conclusion: AI future debates are fundamentally philosophical rather than technical, requiring recognition of different argumentative burdens and expanded notions of expertise to properly understand the disagreements.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the
future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements
over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective,
material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep
disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove
transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that
of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study
begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of
these can be identified as "transformationalists," who argue that continued AI
development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them
are "skeptics," a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or
will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further "strong" and
"weak" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized
contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'
respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular
are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate
time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of
technological development. In highlighting these specific points of
non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different
arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.
At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the
transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates
competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen
the concept of "expertise" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis of GenAI and LLMs development, focusing on research/education applications, technical aspects, ethical challenges, and future scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the evolution, functioning, and implications of generative AI and large language models for academic research and education, particularly in geography contexts.

Method: Conceptual analysis tracing AI evolution through machine learning, deep learning to transformers; examination of technical aspects (prompting, embeddings, sampling methods); critical evaluation of GenAI integration across research processes and pedagogical applications.

Result: Identifies both opportunities and limitations/risks of GenAI; assesses ethical, social, and environmental challenges including bias, IP issues, governance, accountability, and ecological footprint; provides analysis of integration across research lifecycle and educational contexts.

Conclusion: GenAI presents transformative potential for research and education but requires careful consideration of societal responsibilities, ethical frameworks, and sustainable practices; contributes to critical debates on adoption, regulation, and long-term implications.

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning,
and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and
education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI)
through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer
architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative
systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings,
and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are
examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are
considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the
limitations and risks they entail.
  The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research
process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data
collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular
attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider
academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of
GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment,
and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.
  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges
posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and
accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and
emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section
considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of
sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI
within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes
to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal
responsibilities.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: An intuitive interface using LLMs and social robots helps teachers create scenario-based activities from regular curriculum, reducing planning time while promoting multicultural integration and student enjoyment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming nature of creating scenario-based educational activities, especially with complex technologies like social robots, and to facilitate multicultural integration within tight curriculum constraints.

Method: Developed an intuitive interface using LLMs and social robots, co-designed activity frameworks with 4 teachers, and deployed in a week-long study with 27 students to validate system efficacy.

Result: The system effectively reduced planning time, showed positive impact of integration policies on children, and significantly higher student enjoyment with storytelling-based scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses curriculum integration challenges while demonstrating the value of LLMs and social robots in creating engaging, multicultural educational activities with reduced teacher workload.

Abstract: Creating and improvising scenarios for content approaching is an enriching
technique in education. However, it comes with a significant increase in the
time spent on its planning, which intensifies when using complex technologies,
such as social robots. Furthermore, addressing multicultural integration is
commonly embedded in regular activities due to the already tight curriculum.
Addressing these issues with a single solution, we implemented an intuitive
interface that allows teachers to create scenario-based activities from their
regular curriculum using LLMs and social robots. We co-designed different
frameworks of activities with 4 teachers and deployed it in a study with 27
students for 1 week. Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings
highlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children
and demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students'
enjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling.
Additionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term
classroom activities are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of irrational AI development where enterprises blindly invest due to technology hype without systematic value assessments, leading to wasted resources and failed products.

Method: Developed a multi-dimensional evaluation model combining information theory's entropy reduction, economics' bounded rationality, and psychology's irrational decision theories. Uses non-linear formula to capture factor couplings and validated through 10 commercial case studies.

Result: The model effectively distinguishes successful from failed AI products, validating hypotheses about synergistic positive effects, non-linear negative impacts, and interactive regulations. Provides tools for value assessment and rational investment decisions.

Conclusion: The evaluation model reveals AI value generation logic and helps enterprises avoid blind investments, promoting more rational AI industry development. Future work includes adaptive weights, dynamic mechanisms, and extensions to emerging AI technologies like generative models.

Abstract: In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technology
have triggered global industrial transformations, with applications permeating
various fields such as finance, healthcare, education, and manufacturing.
However, this rapid iteration is accompanied by irrational development, where
enterprises blindly invest due to technology hype, often overlooking systematic
value assessments. This paper develops a multi-dimensional evaluation model
that integrates information theory's entropy reduction principle, economics'
bounded rationality framework, and psychology's irrational decision theories to
quantify AI product value. Key factors include positive dimensions (e.g.,
uncertainty elimination, efficiency gains, cost savings, decision quality
improvement) and negative risks (e.g., error probability, impact, and
correction costs). A non-linear formula captures factor couplings, and
validation through 10 commercial cases demonstrates the model's effectiveness
in distinguishing successful and failed products, supporting hypotheses on
synergistic positive effects, non-linear negative impacts, and interactive
regulations. Results reveal value generation logic, offering enterprises tools
to avoid blind investments and promote rational AI industry development. Future
directions include adaptive weights, dynamic mechanisms, and extensions to
emerging AI technologies like generative models.

*Abhirup Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Transformer-based AES models underperform compared to other deep learning architectures. This study enhances transformer models with contextual enrichment, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art models while providing a versatile enhancement method applicable to any AES architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite transformers dominating other NLP tasks, they underperform in Automated Essay Scoring compared to alternative deep learning architectures, creating a need for contextual enrichment to improve their performance.

Method: Augmented transformer-based models with multiple contextual dimensions using the ASAP-AES dataset, analyzing the impact of diverse contextual factors on model performance.

Result: Achieved mean Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across entire dataset and 0.8697 on individual essay sets, surpassing previous transformer models and performing superior in 3 of 8 sets compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Contextual augmentation provides an orthogonal and adaptable enhancement method that significantly improves transformer-based AES performance, offering a versatile technique for refining automated essay scoring capabilities.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has emerged to prominence in response to the
growing demand for educational automation. Providing an objective and
cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses.
Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent
investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform
transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance
of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy
has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual
enrichment.
  This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset,
analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most
effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean
Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and
0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior
transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative
to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an
average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight
sets.
  Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based
advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this
contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining
AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in
educational settings.

*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Proposes masking ground-truth labels to prevent label leakage in Knowledge Tracing models and introduces Recency Encoding to better model learning dynamics like forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many KT models are vulnerable to label leakage where input data inadvertently reveal correct answers, particularly in datasets with multiple knowledge concepts per question. Existing models also often overlook important learning dynamics like forgetting.

Method: Uses a MASK label inspired by BERT's masked language modeling to replace ground-truth labels in susceptible cases. Introduces Recency Encoding to encode step-wise distance between current item and its most recent previous occurrence.

Result: Incorporating these embeddings into KT models (DKT, DKT+, AKT, SAKT) consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Recency Encoding outperforms traditional positional encodings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is both efficient and widely applicable, effectively preventing label leakage while better capturing learning dynamics like forgetting in knowledge tracing tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict a student's future performance based
on their sequence of interactions with learning content. Many KT models rely on
knowledge concepts (KCs), which represent the skills required for each item.
However, some of these models are vulnerable to label leakage, in which input
data inadvertently reveal the correct answer, particularly in datasets with
multiple KCs per question.
  We propose a straightforward yet effective solution to prevent label leakage
by masking ground-truth labels during input embedding construction in cases
susceptible to leakage. To accomplish this, we introduce a dedicated MASK
label, inspired by masked language modeling (e.g., BERT), to replace
ground-truth labels. In addition, we introduce Recency Encoding, which encodes
the step-wise distance between the current item and its most recent previous
occurrence. This distance is important for modeling learning dynamics such as
forgetting, which is a fundamental aspect of human learning, yet it is often
overlooked in existing models. Recency Encoding demonstrates improved
performance over traditional positional encodings on multiple KT benchmarks.
  We show that incorporating our embeddings into KT models like DKT, DKT+, AKT,
and SAKT consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks.
The approach is both efficient and widely applicable.

TL;DR: SimCourt is the first comprehensive court simulation framework based on Chinese trial procedures, using LLM-powered legal agents with memory and planning capabilities to create realistic mock trials that outperform human professionals in some scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mock trials are inaccessible to the public due to reliance on professional tutors and human participants. LLMs provide new opportunities for scalable court simulations, but existing research focuses on agent construction rather than systematic design and evaluation of court procedures.

Method: Developed SimCourt framework replicating all 5 core stages of Chinese trials with 5 courtroom roles. Created legal agents equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities to simulate different trial participants following China's procedural definitions.

Result: Experiments showed the framework generates simulated trials that better guide imprisonment, probation, and fine predictions. Human expert annotations revealed agents' responses outperformed real judges and lawyers in many scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significant potential of LLM-based court simulation for creating accessible, scalable, and high-quality legal training platforms that can even surpass human performance in certain aspects.

Abstract: Mock trial has long served as an important platform for legal professional
training and education. It not only helps students learn about realistic trial
procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment
prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public
because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately,
the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for
creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising,
existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the
systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more
important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To
this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based
on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework
replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom
roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate
trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents
equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal
judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that
better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of
each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses
under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the
real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of
LLM-based court simulation.

*Kyra Wilson,Sourojit Ghosh,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Stable Diffusion XL produces darker skin tones for stigmatized identities, shows less skin tone variability, and perpetuates racial stereotypes compared to previous models and human datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how text-to-image generators perpetuate social stereotypes and systematically associate stigmatized identities with specific skin tones, potentially amplifying bias and representational harms.

Method: Used 93 stigmatized identities to analyze three Stable Diffusion versions (v1.5, v2.1, XL), measuring skin tone darkness, redness, variability, and comparing against human face datasets using perception-correlated metrics.

Result: SD XL produces 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red skin tones, shows 30% less variability than previous models, depicts 60.29% stigmatized identities as less diverse than non-stigmatized ones, and homogenizes racial/ethnic skin tones more than other identities.

Conclusion: SD XL's bias amplification dynamics increase representational harms and challenge diverse image generation for stigmatized identities, with implications for T2I model development and societal impact given user preference for its outputs.

Abstract: Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate
social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a
comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions
of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized
identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL
produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which
indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and
perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized
identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones
when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face
datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to
human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount
of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts
most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized
identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and
ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities,
reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and
socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest
and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other
models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the
dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and
challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized
identities.

TL;DR: PTM model combines teacher-defined programming proficiency taxonomy with AI to better predict struggling programming students by explicitly modeling coding skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches for detecting struggling student programmers don't explicitly reason about students' programming skills, creating a gap in effective early intervention.

Method: Developed Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM) that learns students' coding skills from their coding history and predicts struggle on new tasks, using educator-defined taxonomy of programming proficiencies.

Result: PTM outperformed state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students on datasets from introductory Java and Python courses for beginners.

Conclusion: Combining structured teacher insights with AI modeling shows strong potential for early identification of students needing coding assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of struggling student programmers is crucial for providing
them with personalized support. While multiple AI-based approaches have been
proposed for this problem, they do not explicitly reason about students'
programming skills in the model. This study addresses this gap by developing in
collaboration with educators a taxonomy of proficiencies that categorizes how
students solve coding tasks and is embedded in the detection model. Our model,
termed the Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM), simultaneously learns the
student's coding skills based on their coding history and predicts whether they
will struggle on a new task. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the
PTM model on two separate datasets from introductory Java and Python courses
for beginner programmers. Experimental results demonstrate that PTM outperforms
state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students. The paper showcases
the potential of combining structured insights from teachers for early
identification of those needing assistance in learning to code.

TL;DR: A citizen-centric framework for urban climate resilience using participatory sensing, AI-enhanced tree measurements, heat metrics, and eco-routing to transform urban planning into co-produced local practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban climate resilience requires systems that integrate data collection, interpretation, and action within citizens' daily lives, addressing ecological inequality and data centralization through participatory approaches.

Method: Three interlinked modules: (1) smartphone-based AI toolkit for tree measurements, (2) percentile-based model with Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief metrics using satellite data, (3) eco-routing engine with Static Environmental Quality score based on tree density, diversity, and carbon sequestration.

Result: A closed feedback loop where citizens generate actionable data and benefit from personalized sustainable interventions, transforming open data into an active platform for shared governance and environmental equity.

Conclusion: The framework presents a replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence that reframes urban planning as co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice, demonstrated in Pune, India.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands
systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily
lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework
that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing,
open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India,
the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based
measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy
diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived
Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new
metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing
engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based
on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration.
Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate
actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This
framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active
platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing
ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a
replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a
co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.

TL;DR: Proposes Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness framework with 10 desiderata to address systemic inequities and protect intersectionally marginalized communities in algorithmic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithmic fairness research lacks proper integration of intersectionality, relying on oversimplified single-axis approaches that neglect structural inequalities and complex social realities.

Method: Extends Green's substantive algorithmic fairness with intersectional feminist theory, introduces 10 desiderata within ROOF methodology to guide design, assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems.

Result: Provides actionable guidance for equitable, inclusive algorithmic practices that consider social context, with emphasis on principled non-deployment when necessary.

Conclusion: Bridges computational and social science perspectives to create context-sensitive intersectional algorithmic fairness that cannot be separated from social realities.

Abstract: Intersectionality has profoundly influenced research and political action by
revealing how interconnected systems of privilege and oppression influence
lived experiences, yet its integration into algorithmic fairness research
remains limited. Existing approaches often rely on single-axis or formal
subgroup frameworks that risk oversimplifying social realities and neglecting
structural inequalities. We propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic
Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness
with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Building on this foundation,
we introduce ten desiderata within the ROOF methodology to guide the design,
assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems in ways that address systemic
inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities.
Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata encourage
reflection on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the
inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and enhancing algorithmic systems'
potential. Our approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from
social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be
necessary. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, we
provide actionable guidance for more equitable, inclusive, and
context-sensitive intersectional algorithmic practices.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Error analysis of deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs, showing convergence rates based on DNN architecture size, number of sample points, and optimization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deep Kolmogorov method is widely used for solving PDEs but lacks theoretical error analysis, particularly for heat equations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of convergence rates for the mean square distance between exact PDE solutions and DNN approximations, considering architecture size, sample points, and optimization errors.

Result: The paper provides convergence rates showing how the approximation error decreases with increasing DNN size, more sample points, and reduced optimization error.

Conclusion: The deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs has provable convergence properties, establishing theoretical foundations for this popular deep learning approach to PDE solving.

Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method
for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the
Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep
Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with
convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact
solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep
neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in
terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and
the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the
number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of
input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of
the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.

TL;DR: Walk-on-Interfaces (WoI) is a grid-free Monte Carlo method for Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jumps, featuring consistent accuracy throughout the domain and gradient estimation at minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elliptic interface problems model heterogeneous materials with discontinuous physical properties across interfaces, which are common in scientific and engineering applications but challenging to solve numerically.

Method: Grid-free Monte Carlo estimator using Walk-on-Interfaces approach with variance reduction techniques. Also combines with deep neural networks to regularize solutions by removing Monte Carlo noise.

Result: The method maintains consistent accuracy without close-to-source evaluation issues, provides gradient estimation almost for free, achieves O(1/‚àöW) convergence, and works effectively in up to 6 dimensions with irregular geometries.

Conclusion: WoI provides an effective, highly parallelizable approach for solving complex elliptic interface problems that generalizes naturally to higher dimensions and shows potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering
applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties
change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present
\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a
class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump
conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout
the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source
evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification
with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be
performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of
the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we
use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that
outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our
solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our
estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 /
\sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize
naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that
have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in
solving problems motivated by real-world applications.

### [564] [Introduction to Regularization and Learning Methods for Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18178)
*Danielle Bednarski,Tim Roith*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Lecture notes on mathematical concepts in inverse problems, covering classical regularization theory and modern deep-learning approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive introduction to inverse problems, from classical mathematical foundations to modern machine learning techniques, addressing the challenge of solving ill-posed problems through various regularization and reconstruction methods.

Method: Structured approach starting with inverse problem examples, then classical regularization theory in Hilbert spaces (pseudo-inverse, convergent regularization), followed by practical algorithms like Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization, and finally modern deep-learning methods including learned regularization, Bayesian estimation, and plug-n-play approaches.

Result: A systematic framework for understanding and solving inverse problems, bridging traditional mathematical methods with contemporary machine learning techniques, providing both theoretical foundations and practical implementation strategies.

Conclusion: The notes offer a comprehensive overview of inverse problems, demonstrating the evolution from classical regularization methods to data-driven deep learning approaches, highlighting the growing intersection between mathematical inverse problems and machine learning for improved reconstruction and solution techniques.

Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse
problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as
differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This
then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations
regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then
first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert
spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of
convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the
question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly
focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional
spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which
allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection
between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and
our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics.
Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation,
post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.

### [565] [Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671)
*Sam Ganzfried*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper presents a new opponent modeling algorithm that guarantees convergence to an opponent's true strategy in imperfect-information games, addressing limitations of existing approaches that fail to achieve this even with infinite data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing opponent modeling approaches in multi-agent environments fail to capitalize on historical data and cannot guarantee convergence to opponents' true strategies even with unlimited observations, particularly in imperfect-information games.

Method: Developed a new algorithm that solves a convex minimization problem using projected gradient descent based on the sequence-form game representation, ensuring efficient convergence to the opponent's true strategy.

Result: The algorithm is proven to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given gameplay observations and any available historical data, satisfying the desirable property that existing approaches fail to achieve.

Conclusion: The proposed opponent modeling algorithm provides theoretical guarantees of convergence to true opponent strategies, addressing a fundamental limitation in current multi-agent learning approaches for imperfect-information games.

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward
against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic
solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in
some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and
observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent
modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal
opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such
approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show
that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable
property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution;
namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true
strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches
infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and
runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the
sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The
algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy
given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it
is available.

### [566] [WOMAC: A Mechanism For Prediction Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17907)
*Siddarth Srinivasan,Tao Lin,Connacher Murphy,Anish Thilagar,Yiling Chen,Ezra Karger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: WOMAC is a novel deterministic competition mechanism that scores experts against the best aggregate of peer predictions rather than noisy outcomes, addressing incentive and efficiency issues in standard competition designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard competition designs are neither incentive-compatible nor statistically efficient due to noise in outcomes/labels, which allows weaker competitors to win by chance and incentivizes misreporting.

Method: WOMAC scores experts against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given noisy outcomes, rather than scoring directly against the noisy outcomes themselves.

Result: WOMAC is more efficient than standard competition designs and provides a more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance, as demonstrated on real-world forecasting datasets.

Conclusion: WOMAC offers a deterministic, incentive-compatible alternative to standard competition mechanisms that is particularly useful when there is substantial noise in outcomes/labels.

Abstract: Competitions are widely used to identify top performers in judgmental
forecasting and machine learning, and the standard competition design ranks
competitors based on their cumulative scores against a set of realized outcomes
or held-out labels. However, this standard design is neither
incentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is
noise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker
competitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes
misreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.
Attempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that
add even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism
and practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel
deterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of
scoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts
against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy
outcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in
typical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging
to analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to
justify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation
and demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a
more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the
standard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is
substantial noise in the outcomes/labels.

*Masato Shibukawa,Naoya Ozaki,Maximilien Berthet*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Proposes compressible neural particle method that extends neural networks to model compressible viscous flows using Tait equation for density calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural particle methods were limited to incompressible flows, while traditional SPH methods face stability issues with particle distributions for compressible flows.

Method: Uses feed-forward neural networks to compute velocity and pressure at next time step, Tait equation for density, with loss function based on compressible flow governing equations and boundary conditions.

Result: Successfully applied to dam breaking problem, demonstrating accurate solution for compressible viscous fluid flow that was difficult with SPH methods.

Conclusion: The compressible neural particle method effectively extends neural network-based approaches to handle compressible viscous flows with improved stability over traditional SPH methods.

Abstract: Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but
they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common
method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem
settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking.
However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of
particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational
stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that
approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks.
The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it
has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the
compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural
network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model
compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to
calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step,
and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility.
The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow
and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the
compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking
problem.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RePro is a reflective paper-to-code reproduction framework that extracts paper fingerprints as atomic criteria to guide iterative code generation and refinement, achieving 13% performance improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent-based methods struggle to reproduce implementation details like mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic from research papers due to diverse patterns and complex modules.

Method: Extracts paper fingerprints (comprehensive atomic criteria) as supervisory signals, generates code based on extracted information, and uses iterative verification and refinement loops with fingerprint guidance.

Result: Achieves 13.0% performance improvement over baselines on PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark, effectively revises complex logical and mathematical criteria.

Conclusion: RePro framework successfully addresses paper reproduction challenges by using systematic fingerprint extraction and reflective refinement, demonstrating significant effectiveness in reproducing implementation details.

Abstract: Reproducing machine learning papers is essential for scientific progress but
remains challenging for both humans and automated agents. Existing agent-based
methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details
such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that
reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current
paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap
mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and
varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans
use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose
\textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction
framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a
comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality
supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted
information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification
and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and
produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's
implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev
benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over
baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria
in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Cybernaut is a framework that improves web automation success rates by 23.2% for enterprise applications, addressing challenges in execution consistency and complex web interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web automation solutions work well for consumer websites but fail with poorly-designed internal enterprise web interfaces, creating challenges in consistent execution, element identification, accuracy, and benchmarking.

Method: Developed a framework with three components: SOP generator for converting user demonstrations into automation instructions, high-precision HTML DOM element recognition system for complex interfaces, and quantitative metric for execution consistency assessment.

Result: Achieved 23.2% improvement in task execution success rate (from 72% to 88.68%) over baseline, with 84.7% accuracy in identifying consistent execution patterns for reliable confidence assessment.

Conclusion: Cybernaut effectively addresses enterprise-scale web automation challenges and provides a foundation for future advancements in robust web automation systems.

Abstract: The emergence of AI-driven web automation through Large Language Models
(LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing digital workflows.
However, deploying such systems within industry's real-world environments
presents four core challenges: (1) ensuring consistent execution, (2)
accurately identifying critical HTML elements, (3) meeting human-like accuracy
in order to automate operations at scale and (4) the lack of comprehensive
benchmarking data on internal web applications. Existing solutions are
primarily tailored for well-designed, consumer-facing websites (e.g.,
Amazon.com, Apple.com) and fall short in addressing the complexity of
poorly-designed internal web interfaces. To address these limitations, we
present Cybernaut, a novel framework to ensure high execution consistency in
web automation agents designed for robust enterprise use. Our contributions are
threefold: (1) a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) generator that converts
user demonstrations into reliable automation instructions for linear browsing
tasks, (2) a high-precision HTML DOM element recognition system tailored for
the challenge of complex web interfaces, and (3) a quantitative metric to
assess execution consistency. The empirical evaluation on our internal
benchmark demonstrates that using our framework enables a 23.2% improvement
(from 72% to 88.68%) in task execution success rate over the browser_use.
Cybernaut identifies consistent execution patterns with 84.7% accuracy,
enabling reliable confidence assessment and adaptive guidance during task
execution in real-world systems. These results highlight Cybernaut's
effectiveness in enterprise-scale web automation and lay a foundation for
future advancements in web automation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CelloAI is a locally hosted LLM-based coding assistant with RAG that helps document and generate HEP code while ensuring data privacy and avoiding external dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HEP experiments face massive data volumes requiring HPC integration, but legacy software porting to heterogeneous architectures and poor documentation hinder adoption.

Method: Uses retrieval-augmented generation with specialized components: Doxygen-style comments, file summaries, interactive chatbot, syntax-aware chunking, and callgraph integration for dependency awareness.

Result: Evaluated on real HEP applications from ATLAS, CMS, and DUNE, showing enhanced code understanding and reliable generation while meeting scientific computing safety requirements.

Conclusion: CelloAI successfully addresses HEP code documentation and generation challenges through local LLM deployment with RAG, providing privacy, cost efficiency, and scientific transparency.

Abstract: Next-generation High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments will generate
unprecedented data volumes, necessitating High Performance Computing (HPC)
integration alongside traditional high-throughput computing. However, HPC
adoption in HEP is hindered by the challenge of porting legacy software to
heterogeneous architectures and the sparse documentation of these complex
scientific codebases. We present CelloAI, a locally hosted coding assistant
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) to support HEP code documentation and generation. This local deployment
ensures data privacy, eliminates recurring costs and provides access to large
context windows without external dependencies. CelloAI addresses two primary
use cases, code documentation and code generation, through specialized
components. For code documentation, the assistant provides: (a) Doxygen style
comment generation for all functions and classes by retrieving relevant
information from RAG sources (papers, posters, presentations), (b) file-level
summary generation, and (c) an interactive chatbot for code comprehension
queries. For code generation, CelloAI employs syntax-aware chunking strategies
that preserve syntactic boundaries during embedding, improving retrieval
accuracy in large codebases. The system integrates callgraph knowledge to
maintain dependency awareness during code modifications and provides
AI-generated suggestions for performance optimization and accurate refactoring.
We evaluate CelloAI using real-world HEP applications from ATLAS, CMS, and DUNE
experiments, comparing different embedding models for code retrieval
effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the AI assistant's capability to enhance
code understanding and support reliable code generation while maintaining the
transparency and safety requirements essential for scientific computing
environments.

*Yifan Zhang,Chen Huang,Yueke Zhang,Jiahao Zhang,Toby Jia-Jun Li,Collin McMillan,Kevin Leach,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EyeMulator trains CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention patterns from eye-tracking data, improving performance on code-related tasks without needing eye-tracking during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CodeLLMs use machine attention based solely on input token salience, while human developers have intuitive salience understanding reflected in visual attention patterns. The paper aims to bridge this gap by incorporating human visual attention cues into model training.

Method: Adds special weights for each token in input examples to the loss function during LLM fine-tuning. These weights are derived from human visual attention data collected from eye-tracking experiments in software engineering tasks.

Result: EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on code translation, completion, and summarization tasks. Ablation studies confirm the improvement comes from models learning to mimic human attention patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating human visual attention patterns into CodeLLM training through specialized weighting improves model performance on software development tasks, demonstrating the value of human-inspired attention mechanisms in code language models.

Abstract: Code language models (so-called CodeLLMs) are now commonplace in software
development. As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training
examples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a
process called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input
token salience to output token examples during training. Human software
developers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more
salient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of
philosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since
people tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present
EyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention
while training for various software development tasks. We add special weights
for each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM
fine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention
derived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking
experiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce
changes in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a
model that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation
shows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as
code translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation
study that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to
mimic human attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI coding assistants pose serious legal and compliance risks by potentially generating code governed by restrictive licenses like GPL, which could expose companies to litigation or forced open-sourcing, especially with global legal variations and outsourcing.

Method: Introduces DevLicOps, a practical framework that manages ACA-related licensing risks through governance structures, incident response protocols, and informed tradeoff decision-making processes.

Result: Provides a systematic approach to address licensing compliance challenges in AI-assisted software development, enabling organizations to proactively manage legal risks.

Conclusion: Proactive license compliance through frameworks like DevLicOps is essential for responsible, risk-aware software development as AI coding assistant adoption grows and legal frameworks continue to evolve.

Abstract: Generative AI coding assistants (ACAs) are widely adopted yet pose serious
legal and compliance risks. ACAs can generate code governed by restrictive
open-source licenses (e.g., GPL), potentially exposing companies to litigation
or forced open-sourcing. Few developers are trained in these risks, and legal
standards vary globally, especially with outsourcing. Our article introduces
DevLicOps, a practical framework that helps IT leaders manage ACA-related
licensing risks through governance, incident response, and informed tradeoffs.
As ACA adoption grows and legal frameworks evolve, proactive license compliance

*Md Afif Al Mamun,Gias Uddin,Lan Xia,Longyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TriagerX is a dual-transformer architecture for bug triaging that combines content-based ranking with developer interaction history, outperforming SOTA methods by over 10% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs may attend to irrelevant tokens in bug reports and don't consider developers' historical interactions with similar bugs, leading to suboptimal recommendations.

Method: Uses dual-transformer architecture to generate content-based rankings from last three layers, then refines with interaction-based ranking considering developers' historical bug interactions.

Result: Outperforms 9 transformer-based methods across 5 datasets, improving Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy by over 10%. Successfully deployed in industry with 54% improvement for developer recommendations and 10% for component recommendations.

Conclusion: TriagerX effectively addresses PLM limitations in bug triaging by combining dual-transformers with interaction history, demonstrating significant performance improvements and successful real-world deployment.

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models or PLMs are transformer-based architectures that
can be used in bug triaging tasks. PLMs can better capture token semantics than
traditional Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on statistical features
(e.g., TF-IDF, bag of words). However, PLMs may still attend to less relevant
tokens in a bug report, which can impact their effectiveness. In addition, the
model can be sub-optimal with its recommendations when the interaction history
of developers around similar bugs is not taken into account. We designed
TriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more
reliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer
architecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each
offering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a
robust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines
this ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which
considers developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across
five datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including
SOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation
accuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully
deploy TriagerX in their development environment. The partner required both
developer and component recommendations, with components acting as proxies for
team assignments-particularly useful in cases of developer turnover or team
changes. We trained TriagerX on the partner's dataset for both tasks, and it
outperformed SOTA baselines by up to 10% for component recommendations and 54%
for developer recommendations.

### [574] [Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343)
*Abhik Roychoudhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AI agents show promise in software engineering beyond just code generation, encompassing testing, repair, design tasks, and intent inference. Trustworthy agentic workflows require AI-based verification of generated code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software engineering involves more than just programming, and AI agents can autonomously handle various software tasks including code generation, testing, program repair, and design-level decisions. The core challenge is deciphering developer intent for trustworthy automation.

Method: AI agents aided by program analysis tools autonomously handle micro-decisions across software tasks. The approach involves specification inference (intent deciphering) and AI-based verification and validation (V&V) of AI-generated code.

Result: The paper presents a vision where AI agents function as development team members, capable of handling code-level and design-level software engineering tasks through autonomous decision-making and intent inference.

Conclusion: Successful deployment of agentic AI in software engineering requires conceptual progress in intent inference and AI-based verification to handle the increased volume of automatically generated code, establishing trustworthy agentic workflows.

Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering.
Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from
Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is
much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a
prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing,
and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture
exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the
code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be
taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This
creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen
as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based
software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software
engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.
Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of
many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A
successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would
involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes
more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being
automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with
this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation
(V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in
future will include such AIbased V&V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML is energy-intensive but environmental impacts are understudied. There's a gap in comparing programming languages' energy consumption specifically for ML tasks, despite Python and R being the most popular languages in this domain.

Method: Empirical study measuring energy consumption and runtime performance of five regression and five classification tasks implemented in both Python and R.

Result: Found statistically significant energy cost differences between Python and R in 95% of cases. Programming language choice can influence energy efficiency by up to 99.16% during training and 99.8% during inference.

Conclusion: The choice of programming language significantly impacts energy consumption in ML workflows, highlighting the importance of considering environmental costs when selecting tools for ML development.

Abstract: The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is
extensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive,
contributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources.
While numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a
limited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy
consumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy
consumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and
tasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for
ML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs
associated with employing different programming languages for ML model training
and inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy
consumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five
classification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular
programming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically
significant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases
examined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming
language can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during
model training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.

*Mohammed O. Alannsary*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes AIODC framework adapting Orthogonal Defect Classification for AI systems by adding Data, Learning, and Thinking dimensions to capture AI-specific defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defect analysis models fail to address unique attributes of AI systems, necessitating specialized frameworks for quality assurance in AI-based software.

Method: Modified ODC paradigm by introducing new classification dimensions (Data, Learning, Thinking), adding an attribute, incorporating new severity level, and replacing impact areas with AI-relevant characteristics. Applied to public ML bug dataset with one-way and two-way analysis.

Result: Learning phase defects were most prevalent and linked to high severity. Thinking phase defects disproportionately affected trustworthiness and accuracy. Framework successfully identified high-risk defect categories.

Conclusion: AIODC framework enables effective defect classification for AI systems and provides insights for targeted quality assurance measures in AI development.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of attention recently, it has been
utilized in several fields ranging from daily life activities, such as
responding to emails and scheduling appointments, to manufacturing and
automating work activities. Artificial Intelligence systems are mainly
implemented as software solutions, and it is essential to discover and remove
software defects to assure its quality using defect analysis which is one of
the major activities that contribute to software quality. Despite the
proliferation of AI-based systems, current defect analysis models fail to
capture their unique attributes. This paper proposes a framework inspired by
the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis
of Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and
characteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for
AI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the
Data, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced
classification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an
additional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity
level, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to
AI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available
Machine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way
analysis. The case study indicated that defects occurring during the Learning
phase were the most prevalent and were significantly linked to high-severity
classifications. In contrast, defects identified in the Thinking phase had a
disproportionate effect on trustworthiness and accuracy. These findings
illustrate AIODC's capability to identify high-risk defect categories and
inform focused quality assurance measures.

Abstract: Modern Code Review (MCR) is a standard practice in software engineering, yet
it demands substantial time and resource investments. Recent research has
increasingly explored automating core review tasks using machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL). As a result, there is substantial variability in task
definitions, datasets, and evaluation procedures. This study provides the first
comprehensive analysis of MCR automation research, aiming to characterize the
field's evolution, formalize learning tasks, highlight methodological
challenges, and offer actionable recommendations to guide future research.
Focusing on the primary code review tasks, we systematically surveyed 691
publications and identified 24 relevant studies published between May 2015 and
April 2024. Each study was analyzed in terms of tasks, models, metrics,
baselines, results, validity concerns, and artifact availability. In
particular, our analysis reveals significant potential for standardization,
including 48 task metric combinations, 22 of which were unique to their
original paper, and limited dataset reuse. We highlight challenges and derive
concrete recommendations for examples such as the temporal bias threat, which
are rarely addressed so far. Our work contributes to a clearer overview of the
field, supports the framing of new research, helps to avoid pitfalls, and
promotes greater standardization in evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A.S.E is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM code generation security at repository level using real CVE data, with reproducible containerized evaluation that shows Claude-3.7-Sonnet performs best overall while Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct leads in security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating LLM code security as they focus on isolated snippets, use unstable evaluation methods, and fail to connect input context quality with output security.

Method: A.S.E constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving full repository context. It uses a reproducible containerized evaluation framework with expert-defined rules to assess security, build quality, and generation stability.

Result: Evaluation shows: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet has best overall performance, (2) Security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow with Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct achieving top security score, (3) Concise "fast-thinking" decoding outperforms complex "slow-thinking" reasoning for security patching.

Conclusion: A.S.E provides a robust framework for repository-level security evaluation of LLM-generated code, revealing important insights about model performance and effective decoding strategies for security tasks.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software
engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code.
However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code
snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and
fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output.
To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security
Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E
constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving
full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its
reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to
provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and
generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key
findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The
security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow;
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise,
``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex,
``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.

### [579] [DesCartes Builder: A Tool to Develop Machine-Learning Based Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17988)
*Eduardo de Conto,Blaise Genest,Arvind Easwaran,Nicholas Ng,Shweta Menon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DesCartes Builder is an open-source tool for systematic engineering of ML-based digital twin pipelines using visual data flow paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for digital twin engineering are ad hoc and lack structure, requiring multiple task-specific models rather than single models.

Method: Open-source visual data flow tool with parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms library for specifying, composing, and reusing ML models.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through civil engineering use case for real-time digital twin prototype predicting plastic strain of structures.

Conclusion: Provides structured approach to design digital twins, addressing the need for systematic ML pipeline engineering in digital twin development.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are increasingly utilized to monitor, manage, and
optimize complex systems across various domains, including civil engineering. A
core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and
maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To
this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct
real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived
from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)
specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor
data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT
engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines
often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,
task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required
to design DTs.
  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable
the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes
and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow
paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.
It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML
algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving
the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a
structure.

*Arya Honarpisheh,Mario Sznaier*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A frequency-domain system identification method using nuclear norm regularization of the Loewner matrix to learn low-order systems with proven sample complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for identifying low-order systems from frequency response data with theoretical guarantees on identification accuracy and sample complexity.

Method: Formulates identification as l2 norm minimization between identified and measured frequency responses, with nuclear norm of Loewner matrix as regularization. Uses convex optimization techniques and provides sample complexity analysis.

Result: Derives upper bound on sampled-frequency complexity and extends it to characterize identification error over all frequencies. Numerical simulations validate sample complexity bound growth rate.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively identifies low-order systems with theoretical performance guarantees and efficient computational implementation through convex optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for
learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the
minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency
responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a
regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that
can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We
derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification
process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification
error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is
provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the
sample complexity bound.

*Bokai Zhao,Weiyang Shi,Hanqing Chao,Zijiang Yang,Yiyang Zhang,Ming Song,Tianzi Jiang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF) is a deep learning model for spatial super-resolution in sequencing-based spatial proteomics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with tissue-specific protein reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequencing-based spatial proteomics technologies suffer from low spatial resolution and inter-tissue variability, compromising prediction performance.

Method: NPF formulates seq-SP as protein reconstruction in continuous space using two modules: Spatial Modeling Module for tissue-specific protein distributions and Morphology Modeling Module for tissue-specific morphological features.

Result: NPF achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters and establishes an open-source benchmark dataset (Pseudo-Visium SP).

Conclusion: NPF demonstrates strong potential for advancing spatial proteomics research by providing high-resolution protein distribution mapping with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing
transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based
technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue
variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of
existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the
novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics
(seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning
model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a
protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated
network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which
learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling
Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset,
Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF
achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters,
underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The WildSpoof Challenge is a dual-track competition focusing on spoofed speech generation (TTS) and detection (SASV) using in-the-wild data to address real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance speech processing by moving beyond clean datasets to real-world in-the-wild data, and to bridge the gap between spoofing generation and detection communities for more robust systems.

Method: Two parallel tracks: (1) Text-to-Speech synthesis for generating spoofed speech, and (2) Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification for detecting spoofed speech, using shared data protocols but treated as independent tasks.

Result: Not applicable - this is a challenge announcement describing objectives and structure rather than reporting experimental results.

Conclusion: The challenge aims to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and develop more integrated, realistic speech spoofing systems that perform well in real-world conditions.

Abstract: The WildSpoof Challenge aims to advance the use of in-the-wild data in two
intertwined speech processing tasks. It consists of two parallel tracks: (1)
Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for generating spoofed speech, and (2)
Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) for detecting spoofed
speech. While the organizers coordinate both tracks and define the data
protocols, participants treat them as separate and independent tasks. The
primary objectives of the challenge are: (i) to promote the use of in-the-wild
data for both TTS and SASV, moving beyond conventional clean and controlled
datasets and considering real-world scenarios; and (ii) to encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration between the spoofing generation (TTS) and
spoofing detection (SASV) communities, thereby fostering the development of
more integrated, robust, and realistic systems.

*Neeraj Matiyali,Siddharth Srivastava,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A transformer-based non-autoregressive method for text-conditioned speech insertion that maintains speaker characteristics and prosody while allowing variable-length insertions based on text and tempo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable speech audio updates when text transcripts are corrected, providing a solution for maintaining audio-text synchronization after edits.

Method: Transformer-based non-autoregressive approach that dynamically determines insertion length during inference based on text transcript and input tempo.

Result: Outperforms baseline adaptive TTS methods in experiments and user studies on LibriTTS dataset, with high-quality output demonstrated.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles variable-length speech insertion while preserving speaker voice characteristics and spectral properties, showing superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose a method for the task of text-conditioned speech insertion, i.e.
inserting a speech sample in an input speech sample, conditioned on the
corresponding complete text transcript. An example use case of the task would
be to update the speech audio when corrections are done on the corresponding
text transcript. The proposed method follows a transformer-based
non-autoregressive approach that allows speech insertions of variable lengths,
which are dynamically determined during inference, based on the text transcript
and tempo of the available partial input. It is capable of maintaining the
speaker's voice characteristics, prosody and other spectral properties of the
available speech input. Results from our experiments and user study on LibriTTS
show that our method outperforms baselines based on an existing adaptive text
to speech method. We also provide numerous qualitative results to appreciate
the quality of the output from the proposed method.

### [584] [Multi-Metric Preference Alignment for Generative Speech Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17229)
*Junan Zhang,Xueyao Zhang,Jing Yang,Yuancheng Wang,Fan Fan,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-metric preference alignment strategy for generative speech restoration to address misalignment between training objectives and human perceptual preferences, using a new 80K preference pair dataset and achieving significant performance gains across diverse generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for speech restoration often have training objectives that misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. Post-training alignment has been effective in other domains but remains under-explored for speech restoration.

Method: Proposed a multi-metric preference alignment strategy using a new dataset (GenSR-Pref) with 80K preference pairs. Applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) across three generative paradigms: autoregressive models, masked generative models, and flow-matching models.

Result: Consistent and significant performance gains across various restoration benchmarks in both objective and subjective evaluations. The aligned models can also serve as data annotators for generating high-quality pseudo-labels in data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: The multi-metric preference alignment strategy effectively addresses reward hacking and improves generative speech restoration quality, demonstrating broad applicability across different generative paradigms and practical utility in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration
tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual
preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has
proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation,
its application to generative speech restoration remains largely
under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying
preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust
preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To
address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment
strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference
pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite
of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency,
and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference
signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we
observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse
generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models
(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both
objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority
of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward
hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as
powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as
a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce
scenarios like singing voice restoration. Demo

### [585] [TaDiCodec: Text-aware Diffusion Speech Tokenizer for Speech Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16790)
*Yuancheng Wang,Dekun Chen,Xueyao Zhang,Junan Zhang,Jiaqi Li,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TaDiCodec is a novel speech tokenizer that uses text-aware diffusion transformers to achieve extremely low frame rates (6.25 Hz) and bitrates (0.0875 kbps) while maintaining superior speech quality metrics, with single-stage end-to-end training and no need for auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech tokenizers suffer from limitations including dependence on multi-layer quantization structures, high frame rates, reliance on pre-trained models for semantic distillation, and complex two-stage training processes.

Method: TaDiCodec employs end-to-end optimization through a diffusion autoencoder with text guidance integrated into the diffusion decoder to enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression using a single-layer codebook.

Result: Achieves 6.25 Hz frame rate and 0.0875 kbps bitrate for 24 kHz speech while maintaining superior performance on WER, speaker similarity, and speech quality metrics. Validated in zero-shot text-to-speech with both autoregressive and masked generative modeling.

Conclusion: TaDiCodec demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling with significantly small reconstruction-generation gap, using single-stage training without auxiliary models, making it a promising foundation for speech language models.

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language
models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1)
dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame
rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation,
and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we
introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a
novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs
end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion
autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to
enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec
achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of
0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining
superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as
Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).
Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and
obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the
compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech
with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating
its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a
significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code
and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at
https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at

### [586] [Modality-Specific Speech Enhancement and Noise-Adaptive Fusion for Acoustic and Body-Conduction Microphone Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17336)
*Yunsik Kim,Yoonyoung Chung*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A multi-modal framework combining body-conduction and acoustic microphones for noise-resistant speech processing with high-frequency reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Body-conduction microphones provide strong noise resistance but lose high-frequency information, requiring complementary acoustic microphones to achieve both noise suppression and frequency completeness.

Method: Uses two specialized networks: mapping-based model to enhance BMS and masking-based model to denoise AMS, integrated through dynamic fusion that adapts to local noise conditions.

Result: Outperforms single-modal solutions across various noisy environments on TAPS dataset with DNS-2023 noise augmentation, as measured by objective speech quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal framework effectively combines the strengths of both microphone types through specialized networks and adaptive fusion, achieving superior noise suppression and speech quality.

Abstract: Body\-conduction microphone signals (BMS) bypass airborne sound, providing
strong noise resistance. However, a complementary modality is required to
compensate for the inherent loss of high\-frequency information. In this study,
we propose a novel multi\-modal framework that combines BMS and acoustic
microphone signals (AMS) to achieve both noise suppression and high\-frequency
reconstruction. Unlike conventional multi\-modal approaches that simply merge
features, our method employs two specialized networks\: a mapping-based model
to enhance BMS and a masking-based model to denoise AMS. These networks are
integrated through a dynamic fusion mechanism that adapts to local noise
conditions, ensuring the optimal use of each modality's strengths. We performed
evaluations on the TAPS dataset, augmented with DNS\-2023 noise clips, using
objective speech quality metrics. The results clearly demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single\-modal solutions in a wide range of noisy
environments.

*Takuhiro Kaneko,Hirokazu Kameoka,Kou Tanaka,Yuto Kondo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FasterVoiceGrad is a one-step diffusion-based voice conversion model that achieves 6.6-6.9x GPU speedup and 1.8x CPU speedup compared to FastVoiceGrad while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VC models like VoiceGrad suffer from slow iterative sampling, and even improved versions like FastVoiceGrad still require computationally intensive content encoders that slow down conversion.

Method: Proposes adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD) to simultaneously distill both the diffusion model and content encoder in a one-step process, leveraging adversarial and score distillation training.

Result: Experimental evaluations show FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to FastVoiceGrad with significantly faster conversion speeds: 6.6-6.9x faster on GPU and 1.8x faster on CPU.

Conclusion: FasterVoiceGrad successfully addresses the computational bottlenecks of previous diffusion-based VC models while maintaining high speech quality and speaker similarity through simultaneous distillation of both model components.

Abstract: A diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model (e.g., VoiceGrad) can achieve
high speech quality and speaker similarity; however, its conversion process is
slow owing to iterative sampling. FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by
distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still
requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the
speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose
FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by
simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using
adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is
performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score
distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated
that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to
FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU,
respectively.

### [588] [Vocoder-Projected Feature Discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17874)
*Takuhiro Kaneko,Hirokazu Kameoka,Kou Tanaka,Yuto Kondo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes VPFD - vocoder-projected feature discriminator that uses vocoder features for adversarial training instead of waveforms, reducing training time and memory usage significantly while maintaining comparable voice conversion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TTS/VC systems use acoustic features like mel spectrograms but require vocoders to convert to waveforms for adversarial training, which introduces significant time and memory overhead due to upsampling requirements.

Method: Uses a pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with single upsampling step to create vocoder-projected features for adversarial training, avoiding the need for full waveform generation during training.

Result: Achieves VC performance comparable to waveform discriminators while reducing training time by 9.6x and memory consumption by 11.4x in diffusion-based VC distillation experiments.

Conclusion: VPFD provides an efficient alternative to waveform discriminators that maintains performance while dramatically reducing computational costs, making adversarial training more practical for TTS and VC applications.

Abstract: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as
mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing
to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal
is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these
features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is
reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time
and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected
feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial
training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a
pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step
is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of
waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption
by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

TL;DR: Lightweight multimodal system with dynamic fusion for suicide risk detection, combining time-domain, time-frequency acoustic features and semantic representations, achieving 78% parameter reduction and 5% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a leading cause of adolescent death, and previous studies focused on isolated modalities. Multimodal integration of speech and text offers more comprehensive mental state understanding.

Method: Multi-branch multimodal system with dynamic fusion mechanism that applies learnable weights to each modality. Incorporates both time-domain and time-frequency domain acoustic features plus semantic representations. Lightweight structure design for computational efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to baseline with 78% reduction in model parameters and 5% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight multimodal system with dynamic fusion effectively integrates acoustic and semantic information for improved speechwellness detection with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous
suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or
acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such
as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an
individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st
SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch
multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness
detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on
time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both
time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as
semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to
adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it
applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling
the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational
efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original
baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a
78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.

*Deepak Kumar,Divakar Yadav,Yash Patel*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: GPT-OSS-20B (MoE model) outperforms dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B in decode throughput, energy efficiency, and VRAM usage, despite higher TTFT due to MoE routing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the deployment efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models compared to dense baselines on single-GPU systems, focusing on practical metrics like throughput, latency, VRAM usage, and energy consumption.

Method: Single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation measuring time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values, and energy consumption using nvidia-smi-based sampling at 2048-token context with 64-token decode.

Result: GPT-OSS-20B achieves 31.8% higher decode throughput, 25.8% lower energy per 1000 tokens, and 31.7% less peak VRAM than Qwen3-32B, with only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B total). Shows superior per-active-parameter efficiency despite higher TTFT.

Conclusion: MoE models like GPT-OSS-20B offer significant deployment advantages over dense models in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, and memory usage, making them more practical for real-world applications despite the routing overhead cost.

Abstract: We present a single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B
(Mixture-of-Experts; 20.9B total, approx. 3.61B active) against dense baselines
Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B across multiple dimensions. We measure true
time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency
percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values (PKV) held, and energy via a
consistent nvidia-smi-based sampler. At a 2048-token context with 64-token
decode, GPT-OSS-20B delivers higher decode throughput and tokens per Joule than
dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B, while substantially reducing peak VRAM
and energy per 1000 generated tokens; its TTFT is higher due to MoE routing
overhead. With only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B), GPT-OSS-20B
provides about 31.8% higher decode throughput and 25.8% lower energy per 1000
generated tokens than Qwen3-32B at 2048/64, while using 31.7% less peak VRAM.
Normalized by active parameters, GPT-OSS-20B shows markedly stronger
per-active-parameter efficiency (APE), underscoring MoE's deployment
advantages. We do not evaluate accuracy; this is a deployment-focused study. We

*Mengyuan Yin,Benjamin Chen Ming Choong,Chuping Qu,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Weng-Fai Wong,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FPGA-based reconfigurable lookup architecture enables energy-efficient deployment of learned activation functions for edge AI, achieving 10^4x higher energy efficiency than CPUs/GPUs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned activation functions in models like KANs offer superior accuracy and interpretability but face computational complexity challenges that make them impractical for energy-constrained edge AI deployments due to prohibitive latency and power costs on conventional CPUs/GPUs.

Method: A reconfigurable lookup architecture using edge FPGAs that couples fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables to minimize energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for learned functions.

Result: The FPGA-based design achieves superior computational speed and over 10^4 times higher energy efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy and minimal footprint overhead in KAN evaluations.

Conclusion: This approach serves as a practical enabler for energy-critical edge AI, overcoming traditional computational intensity and power constraints that previously precluded the use of adaptive activation networks in edge deployments.

Abstract: Learned activation functions in models like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
outperform fixed-activation architectures in terms of accuracy and
interpretability; however, their computational complexity poses critical
challenges for energy-constrained edge AI deployments. Conventional CPUs/GPUs
incur prohibitive latency and power costs when evaluating higher order
activations, limiting deployability under ultra-tight energy budgets. We
address this via a reconfigurable lookup architecture with edge FPGAs. By
coupling fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables, our design
minimizes energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation
fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for
learned functions, a key advantage for edge systems that require
post-deployment adaptability. Evaluations using KANs - where unique activation
functions play a critical role - demonstrate that our FPGA-based design
achieves superior computational speed and over $10^4$ times higher energy
efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy
and minimal footprint overhead. This breakthrough positions our approach as a
practical enabler for energy-critical edge AI, where computational intensity
and power constraints traditionally preclude the use of adaptive activation
networks.

### [592] [Robust Market Making: To Quote, or not To Quote](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16588)
*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: This paper enhances market making strategies by allowing occasional refusal to quote or single-sided quotes, showing improved returns and Sharpe ratios compared to continuous quoting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional market making assumes continuous quoting, but in practice market makers can occasionally refuse to quote or provide single-sided quotes while still meeting market requirements. The authors aim to explore richer strategy spaces beyond continuous quoting.

Method: The researchers designed two new market maker agents with richer action spaces: one that can refuse to quote in addition to providing bid-ask quotes, and another that can also provide single-sided quotes. They used a model-driven approach to compare these agents with continuously quoting market makers in various adversarial environments.

Result: Occasional refusal to provide bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. Well-trained market makers can achieve quoting ratios up to 99.9%, meeting any market requirements while benefiting from the flexibility of not quoting continuously.

Conclusion: Enriching market making strategies with the option to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes leads to better performance metrics (returns and Sharpe ratios) while still satisfying market quoting requirements, demonstrating the value of more flexible quoting strategies.

Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit
from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has
been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement
learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to
lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting
throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for
``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the
market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the
strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide
single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that
provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with
increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask
quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,
refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a
model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the
continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of
adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide
bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of
well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to
99.9$\%$ in some cases.

### [593] [ARL-Based Multi-Action Market Making with Hawkes Processes and Variable Volatility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16589)
*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: ARL-based market-making with Hawkes processes and expanded action space shows robust performance across volatility levels, with 4-action strategy maintaining stable quotes 92%+ of time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance market-making strategies by better capturing real market dynamics through Hawkes processes (instead of Poisson) and expanding action flexibility for improved adaptability across volatility conditions.

Method: Integrated Adversarial Reinforcement Learning with Hawkes Processes to model self-exciting market behaviors, expanded action space to include quoting on both sides, one side, or not quoting at all, and tested under volatility levels of 2 and 200.

Result: The 4-action market maker trained in low-volatility environment effectively adapted to high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing two-sided quotes at least 92% of the time.

Conclusion: Flexible quoting mechanisms combined with realistic market simulations using Hawkes processes significantly enhance market-making strategy effectiveness and robustness across different volatility environments.

Abstract: We advance market-making strategies by integrating Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (ARL), Hawkes Processes, and variable volatility levels while also
expanding the action space available to market makers (MMs). To enhance the
adaptability and robustness of these strategies -- which can quote always,
quote only on one side of the market or not quote at all -- we shift from the
commonly used Poisson process to the Hawkes process, which better captures real
market dynamics and self-exciting behaviors. We then train and evaluate
strategies under volatility levels of 2 and 200. Our findings show that the
4-action MM trained in a low-volatility environment effectively adapts to
high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing
two-sided quotes at least 92\% of the time. This indicates that incorporating
flexible quoting mechanisms and realistic market simulations significantly
enhances the effectiveness of market-making strategies.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: THEME framework uses hierarchical contrastive learning with text embeddings and stock returns to improve thematic stock selection and portfolio construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thematic investing faces challenges in stock selection due to overlapping sectors and evolving market dynamics, requiring better methods to identify thematically relevant stocks with strong return potential.

Method: Constructed Thematic Representation Set (TRS) dataset from ETFs, industry classifications, and financial news. Developed THEME framework with hierarchical contrastive learning: semantic alignment of theme/stock embeddings followed by temporal refinement using stock returns.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval metrics and significantly improves portfolio construction performance.

Conclusion: THEME provides scalable and adaptive solution for thematic investing by jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from returns.

Abstract: Thematic investing aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural
trends, yet selecting relevant stocks remains challenging due to overlapping
sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. To address this challenge, we
construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that
begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating
industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage
limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to
their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on
this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as
embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to
achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings
through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns.
The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of
thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results
show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval
metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By
jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from
returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for
navigating complex investment themes.

### [595] [Named Entity Recognition of Historical Text via Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18090)
*Shibingfeng Zhang,Giovanni Colavizza*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: LLMs can perform reasonably well on historical NER tasks using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, offering a viable alternative to supervised methods when annotated data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical texts lack annotated datasets for NER due to high labeling costs and language variability, making traditional supervised approaches infeasible.

Method: Used zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs on the HIPE-2022 dataset, requiring minimal to no task-specific training data.

Result: LLMs achieved reasonably strong performance on historical NER, though not matching fully supervised domain-specific models.

Conclusion: LLMs provide an efficient alternative for information extraction in low-resource historical corpora where traditional methods are impractical.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named
Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper
names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other
specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from
unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information
retrieval from unstructured text.
  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches,
which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical
texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or
nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling.
In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as
inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the
development of reliable NER systems for these sources.
  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in
historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which
require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on
the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)
dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks
in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models
trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising.
These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for
information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora,
where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

*Wenlong Ding,Jianqiang Li,Zhixiong Niu,Huangxun Chen,Yongqiang Xiong,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Xumi is an LLM-based system that automates ACL configuration by translating natural language intents into rules, detecting conflicts, and optimizing deployment, achieving 10x speedup and 40% rule reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACL configuration is complex and error-prone due to manual translation of policies, conflict resolution, and deployment across networks, requiring automation to scale.

Method: Leverages LLMs with domain knowledge to translate natural language intents into ACL rules, detects conflicts, generates resolved intents with operator guidance, and optimizes deployment plans.

Result: Xumi accelerates configuration by over 10x, handles O(100) conflicting ACLs, and reduces rule additions by ~40% in cloud networks.

Conclusion: Xumi effectively automates the ACL configuration pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort and improving efficiency in network management.

Abstract: ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet
its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To
carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new
configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules,
(2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3)
deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts
for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone,
and impractical to scale.
  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge
of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural
language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts.
Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and
generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally
identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while
satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire
configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses
O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud
network.

TL;DR: Cross-lingual TTS synthesis using adapters for lightweight systems, enabling target voice generation in target languages without recordings, with objective evaluation showing effectiveness in learning language/speaker specifics while preventing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech synthesis through adapters for lightweight systems, specifically comparing unseen speaker and language adaptation to synthesize target voices in target languages where no recordings exist.

Method: Using adapters in pre-trained TTS models to learn language-specific and speaker-specific information, with evaluation of adapter placement, configuration, and number of speakers. Proposed objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques for L2 learners.

Result: Objective evaluations demonstrate adapters effectively learn language-specific and speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen speaker identities or languages while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of original model information.

Conclusion: Adapters are effective for cross-lingual TTS synthesis, providing insights into optimal adapter placement and configuration, with a validated objective metric for measuring native-like accent quality in generated voices.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis
through the lens of adapters, in the context of lightweight TTS systems. In
particular, we compare the tasks of unseen speaker and language adaptation with
the goal of synthesising a target voice in a target language, in which the
target voice has no recordings therein. Results from objective evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of adapters in learning language-specific and
speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen
speaker identities or languages, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the
original model's speaker or language information. Additionally, to measure how
native the generated voices are in terms of accent, we propose and validate an
objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques in
second-language (L2) learners. The paper also provides insights into the impact
of adapter placement, configuration and the number of speakers used.

TL;DR: shadowAttn is a system-algorithm codesigned sparse attention module that enables efficient on-device LLM inference by minimizing CPU/GPU usage through sparse attention computation and NPU-based pilot operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM frameworks suffer from attention operator fallback from NPU to CPU/GPU due to quantization sensitivity, causing degraded user experience and complex system scheduling for on-device privacy-preserving LLMs.

Method: Uses sparse attention on a tiny portion of tokens, hides overhead with NPU-based pilot compute, implements NPU compute graph bucketing, head-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline, and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio.

Result: Delivers best performance with highly limited CPU/GPU resources and requires much less CPU/GPU resource to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: shadowAttn provides an efficient solution for on-device LLM inference by optimizing attention computation through system-algorithm co-design, enabling better privacy preservation and user experience.

Abstract: On-device running Large Language Models (LLMs) is nowadays a critical enabler
towards preserving user privacy. We observe that the attention operator falls
back from the special-purpose NPU to the general-purpose CPU/GPU because of
quantization sensitivity in state-of-the-art frameworks. This fallback results
in a degraded user experience and increased complexity in system scheduling. To
this end, this paper presents shadowAttn, a system-algorithm codesigned sparse
attention module with minimal reliance on CPU/GPU by only sparsely calculating
the attention on a tiny portion of tokens. The key idea is to hide the overhead
of estimating the important tokens with a NPU-based pilot compute. Further,
shadowAttn proposes insightful techniques such as NPU compute graph bucketing,
head-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio to
achieve high accuracy and efficiency. shadowAttn delivers the best performance
with highly limited CPU/GPU resource; it requires much less CPU/GPU resource to
deliver on-par performance of SoTA frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have heavy resource demands, making quantization critical for efficient serving, but there's a lack of systematic understanding of performance, energy, and quality tradeoffs in realistic serving conditions.

Method: Developed qMeter framework for automated online characterization, evaluated 11 post-training quantization methods across 4 model sizes (7B-70B) and 2 GPU architectures (A100, H100) at application, workload, parallelism, and hardware levels.

Result: Revealed highly task- and method-dependent tradeoffs, strong sensitivity to workload characteristics, and complex interactions with parallelism and GPU architecture. Presented three optimization case studies for deployment challenges.

Conclusion: This is one of the first comprehensive multi-level characterizations of LLM quantization from joint performance, energy, and quality perspective, providing valuable insights for efficient deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but their heavy resource demands make quantization-reducing
precision to lower-bit formats-critical for efficient serving. While many
quantization methods exist, a systematic understanding of their performance,
energy, and quality tradeoffs in realistic serving conditions remains a gap. In
this work, we first develop a fully automated online characterization framework
qMeter, and then conduct an in-depth characterization of 11 post-training LLM
quantization methods across 4 model sizes (7B-70B) and two GPU architectures
(A100, H100). We evaluate quantization at the application, workload,
parallelism, and hardware levels under online serving conditions. Our study
reveals highly task- and method-dependent tradeoffs, strong sensitivity to
workload characteristics, and complex interactions with parallelism and GPU
architecture. We further present three optimization case studies illustrating
deployment challenges in capacity planning, energy-efficient scheduling, and
multi-objective tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
comprehensive application-, system-, and hardware-level characterization of LLM
quantization from a joint performance, energy, and quality perspective.

*Xavier Gonzalez,Leo Kozachkov,David M. Zoltowski,Kenneth L. Clarkson,Scott W. Linderman*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper establishes that the predictability of nonlinear state space models determines whether they can be efficiently parallelized, with predictable systems achieving O((log T)^2) evaluation time while chaotic systems cannot be effectively parallelized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors governing the difficulty of parallelizing nonlinear state space models through optimization approaches, as current methods like DEER and DeepPCR show promise but lack clear guidelines on when they work effectively.

Method: The authors establish a theoretical relationship between system dynamics and optimization conditioning, analyzing how predictability (sensitivity to perturbations) affects optimization convergence. They validate through extensive experiments.

Result: Predictable systems can be evaluated in O((log T)^2) time, a major improvement over sequential approaches. Chaotic systems exhibit poor conditioning that degrades exponentially with sequence length, making parallel evaluation ineffective.

Conclusion: Predictability is the key factor determining parallelization efficiency in nonlinear dynamical systems, providing practical guidance for designing parallelizable models and identifying when optimization-based approaches will be effective.

Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to
understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized.
Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have
shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a
parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield
dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the
difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger
adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship
between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its
corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a
system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence
future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for
evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in
$O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement
over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or
unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that
parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the
optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable
systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence
length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing
practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently
parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for
parallelizable models.

TL;DR: Empirical study identifies optimal pairwise comparison patterns for color selection, validating previous simulations and providing practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal number and pattern of pairwise comparisons needed for decision-making and preference modeling, using empirical data from color selection experiments.

Method: Conducted color selection experiment with 301 participants comparing six colors on calibrated tablets in standardized test booths. Analyzed all possible comparison patterns using logarithmic least squares weight calculation on pairwise comparison matrices.

Result: Empirical results matched previous simulations - optimal comparison patterns from experiments were the best or second best in prior simulations. Identified the same optimal sequence of comparisons as simulated studies.

Conclusion: The study validates simulation-based findings with empirical data and provides practical tools (table format and Java application) for implementing optimal comparison patterns in decision-making contexts.

Abstract: One of the essential issues in decision problems and preference modeling is
the number of comparisons and their pattern to ask from the decision maker. We
focus on the optimal patterns of pairwise comparisons and the sequence
including the most (close to) optimal cases based on the results of a color
selection experiment. In the test, six colors (red, green, blue, magenta,
turquoise, yellow) were evaluated with pairwise comparisons as well as in a
direct manner, on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test
booths of a sensory laboratory. All the possible patterns of comparisons
resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete
data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the
logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the
empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs,
are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The
obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the
second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of
comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the
same. In order to enhance the applicability of the results, besides the
presentation of graph of graphs, and the representing graphs of the patterns
that describe the proposed sequence of comparisons themselves, the
recommendations are also detailed in a table format as well as in a Java
application.

### [603] [HV Metric For Time-Domain Full Waveform Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17122)
*Matej Neumann,Yunan Yang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes the HV metric as a new transport-based distance for full-waveform inversion that works naturally with signed signals, avoiding the need for artificial probability conversion required by Wasserstein distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional L¬≤ misfit suffers from non-convexity and cycle skipping issues in full-waveform inversion. Wasserstein distances help but require problematic preprocessing that modifies amplitude and phase information of wave data.

Method: The authors introduce the HV metric, derive closed-form expressions for its Fr√©chet derivative and Hessian, and perform spectral analysis showing it interpolates between L¬≤, H‚Åª¬π, and H‚Åª¬≤ norms through tunable hyperparameters.

Result: Synthetic experiments on Marmousi and BP benchmark models show the HV metric yields faster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to both L¬≤ and Wasserstein misfits.

Conclusion: The HV metric serves as a robust, geometry-preserving alternative for large-scale waveform inversion, offering tunable trade-offs between local point-wise matching and global transport-based matching.

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing
high-resolution material parameters from seismic or ultrasound data. The
conventional least-squares (\(L^{2}\)) misfit suffers from pronounced
non-convexity that leads to \emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits,
such as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use
requires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a
preprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of
time-dependent wave data. We propose the \emph{HV metric}, a transport-based
distance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for
the \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing
the metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive
closed-form expressions for the Fr\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \(f
\mapsto d_{\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\), enabling efficient adjoint-state
implementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the
hyperparameters \((\kappa,\lambda,\epsilon)\), the HV misfit seamlessly
interpolates between \(L^{2}\), \(H^{-1}\), and \(H^{-2}\) norms, offering a
tunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global
transport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP
benchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields
faster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to
both \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein misfits. These results demonstrate the HV metric
as a robust, geometry-preserving alternative for large-scale waveform
inversion.

*Xinxing Ren,Caelum Forder,Qianbo Zang,Ahsen Tahir,Roman J. Georgio,Suman Deb,Peter Carroll,√ñnder G√ºrcan,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Anemoi is a semi-centralized multi-agent system that enables direct inter-agent communication through A2A MCP server, reducing planner dependency and improving collaboration efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized multi-agent systems suffer from strong dependency on planner capability and limited inter-agent communication through costly prompt concatenation, leading to redundancy and information loss.

Method: Proposed Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol, enabling structured direct inter-agent collaboration with real-time monitoring, progress assessment, and adaptive plan updates.

Result: Achieved 52.73% accuracy on GAIA benchmark with small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as planner, surpassing strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings.

Conclusion: Anemoi reduces reliance on single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, minimizes redundant context passing, and enables more scalable and cost-efficient execution in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed
a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent
coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While
effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical
limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to
degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited
inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt
concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information
loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS
built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.
Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent
collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,
identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm
reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and
minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and
cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved
52.73\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the
strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\%) by +9.09\% under identical LLM
settings. Our implementation is publicly available at

Conclusion: Advances cosmology by introducing a generative model that closely resembles gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving toward physically realistic and efficient simulators for large-scale structure evolution.

Abstract: Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.

### [606] [Entanglement Detection with Quantum-inspired Kernels and SVMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17909)
*Ana Mart√≠nez-Sabiote,Michalis Skotiniotis,Jara J. Bermejo-Vega,Daniel Manzano,Carlos Cano*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Machine learning with SVM and quantum-inspired kernels detects quantum entanglement in bipartite systems, achieving high accuracy (80-100%) across different dimensions where traditional PPT methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion only provides partial entanglement detection in higher-dimensional quantum systems (3x3, 4x4, 5x5), creating a need for more effective methods.

Method: Support vector machines with quantum-inspired kernels to classify separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and PPT-undetectable entangled states, using principal component analysis to enhance performance with small training sets.

Result: Achieved increasing accuracy with system dimension: 80% for 3x3, 90% for 4x4, and nearly 100% for 5x5 systems. PCA significantly improved performance for small training sets.

Conclusion: Machine learning serves as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection methods, especially for higher-dimensional systems. Future research should focus on hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data generation protocols.

Abstract: This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector
machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in
bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial
transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs
with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that
distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and
entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing
accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3,
4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component
analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study
reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the
generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing
these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine
learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection
methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional
approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future
research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data
generation protocols to overcome current limitations.

### [607] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning for Multiclass Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18161)
*Shuchismita Anwar,Sowmitra Das,Muhammad Iqbal Hossain,Jishnu Mahmud*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Using discarded qubit states from quantum CNNs alongside classical classifiers improves multiclass image classification performance by preserving entangled information that would otherwise be lost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum convolutional neural networks discard qubit states after pooling, losing valuable entangled information that remains correlated with retained qubits.

Method: Proposed hybrid quantum-classical architecture with modified QCNN and two fully connected classical heads that separately process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, then ensemble outputs before final classification with joint optimization using cross-entropy loss.

Result: Outperforms comparable lightweight models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST datasets.

Conclusion: Reusing discarded qubit information is a promising approach for hybrid quantum-classical models and may extend beyond image classification tasks.

Abstract: This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image
classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the
discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical
classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit
states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain
entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is
lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the
conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a
hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully
connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately
process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are
ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a
classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to
adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on
MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing
discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid
quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.

*Zhao Feng,Xin-Yang Liu,Meet Hemant Parikh,Junyi Guo,Pan Du,Bicheng Yan,Jian-Xun Wang*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: CoNFiLD-geo is a generative AI model that combines conditional neural fields with latent diffusion for efficient uncertainty-aware modeling of geological carbon sequestration processes, enabling zero-shot conditional generation and data assimilation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) effectiveness depends on accurate subsurface flow characterization, but geological uncertainty from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity challenges predictive modeling. Existing inverse modeling methods are computationally intensive and lack generalizability.

Method: Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) framework that synergistically combines conditional neural field encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models. The model is pretrained unconditionally in self-supervised manner, followed by Bayesian posterior sampling for data assimilation without task-specific retraining.

Result: Comprehensive validation across synthetic and real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency, generalization, scalability, and robustness. Enables effective data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling.

Conclusion: CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy systems by providing efficient uncertainty-aware modeling, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon future.

Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for
mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately
characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty,
stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses
significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse
modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack
generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a
Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative
framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of
GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field
encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling
zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across
complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally
in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process,
allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without
task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and
real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency,
generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data
assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling,
CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy
systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon
future.

### [609] [3D latent diffusion models for parameterizing and history matching multiscenario facies systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16621)
*Guido Di Federico,Louis J. Durlofsky*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Latent diffusion models for 3D geological parameterization enable efficient history matching with reduced variables while preserving geological realism across different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient parameterization method for 3D channel-levee-mud systems that reduces calibration variables in history matching while automatically preserving geological realism through generative models.

Method: A generative latent diffusion model (LDM) approach with perceptual loss during training to improve geological realism. The method parameterizes geomodels with variable mud fraction, channel orientation, and channel width, allowing infinite realizations for any scenario parameter set.

Result: LDM-generated realizations closely resemble reference geomodels visually and statistically (one- and two-point spatial statistics). Flow response distributions match well between generated and reference models. Ensemble-based history matching shows clear uncertainty reduction in production forecasts and geological scenario parameters.

Conclusion: The LDM-based parameterization method effectively handles geological scenario uncertainty, provides posterior geomodels consistent with true models, and enables efficient history matching while maintaining geological realism across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a
high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These
parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of
variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be
constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this
work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models
(LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable
scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and
channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during
training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an
(essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM
parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using
the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both
visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response
distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also
shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The
parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with
model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological
scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to
different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both
production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is
additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic
true model in each case.

*Marco S. Tayar,Lucas K. de Oliveira,Juliano D. Negri,Thiago H. Segreto,Ricardo V. Godoy,Marcelo Becker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comparative study of PPO vs SAC DRL algorithms for UAV navigation in GPS-denied confined spaces. PPO achieved stable collision-free navigation while SAC failed consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure like ventilation shafts is hazardous for humans. UAVs offer an alternative but require robust control policies in GPS-denied environments to prevent collisions.

Method: Used Deep Reinforcement Learning with two algorithms: on-policy PPO and off-policy SAC. Training conducted in Genesis simulation with procedurally generated duct environments. Reward function designed to guide drone through waypoints with heavy collision penalties.

Result: PPO learned a stable policy that completed all evaluation episodes without collision and produced smooth trajectories. SAC consistently converged to suboptimal behavior, failing after initial segments.

Conclusion: In hazard-dense navigation, on-policy methods like PPO offer better training stability than off-policy algorithms like SAC. Procedurally generated high-fidelity simulations are effective testbeds for developing robust navigation policies.

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fast development of AV technology requires extensive simulation testing, but creating accurate maps for simulators like CARLA is difficult and resource-intensive, with existing workflows being computationally heavy and simulator-specific.

Method: Presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development, specifically demonstrated through generating a 3D map of a university parking lot.

Result: Successfully generated a 3D map of Ontario Tech University parking lot, providing a more efficient approach to map creation for AV simulation testing.

Conclusion: The workflow shows promise for simplifying map generation in AV development, with future work planned to incorporate SLAM technologies, optimize for broader simulator compatibility, and improve latitude/longitude handling for better accuracy.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario

optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation
accuracy.

TL;DR: HumanoidVerse is a vision-language framework for humanoid control that enables robots to perform multi-object rearrangement tasks using natural language instructions and camera observations, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable physically simulated robots to perform long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes, overcoming limitations of prior methods that only handled single-object interactions in fixed settings.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum training with dual-teacher distillation pipeline, using a large-scale dataset of 350 multi-object tasks across four room layouts, trained in Isaac Gym simulator with natural language instructions and egocentric RGB camera observations.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both task success rate and spatial precision, and demonstrates good generalization to unseen environments and instructions.

Conclusion: Represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose humanoid agents capable of executing complex sequential tasks under real-world sensory constraints.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world

*Fan Ding,Xuewen Luo,Hwa Hui Tew,Ruturaj Reddy,Xikun Wang,Junn Yong Loo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner that uses GRPO fine-tuning and LLM guidance to achieve adaptive, instruction-aware autonomous driving with diverse behaviors while maintaining strong planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planners for autonomous driving tend to be rigid after supervised training, lacking adaptability to human preferences and dynamic instruction-driven demands.

Method: Proposes M-diffusion planner with shared-weight multi-head architecture, uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning diverse behaviors, and incorporates LLM for dynamic strategy selection at inference.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on nuPlan val14 benchmark, retains strong planning capability in closed-loop simulation, and generates diverse trajectories satisfying multi-modal driving requirements in open-loop tests.

Conclusion: The approach enables adaptive, instruction-aware planning without model switching, effectively addressing the limitations of rigid fixed-policy planners while maintaining high-quality trajectory generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HDSim is a traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with LLM assistance to create realistic and diverse traffic scenarios for self-driving system testing, improving safety-critical failure detection by up to 68%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulation solutions rely on handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models that capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited driving style diversity and interpretability, which is insufficient for reliable self-driving system evaluation.

Method: HDSim introduces a hierarchical driver model representing diverse driving style traits and develops a Perception-Mediated Behavior Influence strategy where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape driver actions, combining cognitive theory with LLM assistance.

Result: Embedding HDSim into simulation improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to 68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework advances traffic simulation by producing scalable and realistic traffic scenarios that better evaluate self-driving system reliability before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Motivation: ASR systems in real-world settings need to handle imperfect audio from diverse user groups, particularly in human-robot interaction where recognition errors can impact task performance, user trust, and safety.

Method: Evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific, accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech.

Result: Significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies, and inherent biases were found across different ASR systems, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current ASR limitations have serious implications for HRI applications, where recognition errors can interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety, highlighting the need for more robust systems.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly

accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for quadruped robots with arms that uses sim-to-real training with synthetic grasp data to enable precise autonomous grasping without extensive real-world calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots with manipulator arms can perform complex loco-manipulation tasks but struggle with precise grasping due to the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp configurations.

Method: Sim-to-real methodology using Genesis simulation to generate synthetic dataset of grasp attempts with pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps. Trained a custom CNN with U-Net architecture that processes multi-modal input (RGB, depth, segmentation masks, surface normals) to output grasp-quality heatmaps.

Result: Successfully validated on a four-legged robot that autonomously navigated to target objects, perceived them, predicted optimal grasp poses, and performed precise grasps in a complete loco-manipulation task.

Conclusion: Leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing provides a scalable and effective solution for object handling in quadruped robots, enabling precise grasping without extensive real-world data collection.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Motivation: Developing robotic systems for long-horizon manipulation tasks requires both physical dexterity and skill sequencing, but acquiring comprehensive datasets for imitation learning is resource-intensive.

Method: Automatically decomposes task demonstrations into skills using foundation models, generates diverse synthetic datasets from few human demos via reinforcement learning, and uses a Skill Routing Transformer policy to chain learned skills.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks show significant improvements in task performance and robustness compared to previous baselines.

Conclusion: LodeStar effectively addresses the challenge of robust long-horizon manipulation by leveraging foundation models, synthetic data generation, and skill chaining, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon
manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks
require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills
while robustly handling environment variations. While imitation learning offers
a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive.
In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that
automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful
skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic

*Guanxing Lu,Baoxiong Jia,Puhao Li,Yixin Chen,Ziwei Wang,Yansong Tang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Gaussian World Model (GWM) uses 3D Gaussian primitives and Diffusion Transformer to predict future scenes for robotic manipulation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based world models lack robust geometric information and consistent 3D spatial understanding needed for robotic manipulation, even when pre-trained on large video datasets.

Method: Proposes GWM with latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) and 3D variational autoencoder to reconstruct future states by inferring Gaussian primitive propagation under robot actions, using Gaussian Splatting for fine-grained scene reconstruction.

Result: GWM precisely predicts future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions and trains policies that significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong 3D world model scaling potential.

Conclusion: The Gaussian World Model successfully bridges the gap in geometric understanding for robotic manipulation, providing both enhanced visual representation for imitation learning and serving as an effective neural simulator for model-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

*Krishna Vinod,Prithvi Jai Ramesh,Pavan Kumar B N,Bharatesh Chakravarthi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Open-source ROS package for Gazebo that generates synthetic event streams from RGB cameras to enable event-based robotic policy evaluation in navigation and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer superior latency, dynamic range and power efficiency but lack simulation support in mainstream robotics platforms, hindering evaluation of event-driven approaches.

Method: Developed v2e ROS package for Gazebo that converts RGB camera feeds to event streams. Trained Transformer-based event robotic policies via behavior cloning and compared with RGB-based policies in object following (mobile robot) and object detection/grasping (manipulator) scenarios.

Result: Event-guided policies consistently showed competitive advantages over RGB-based counterparts across various operating conditions.

Conclusion: Event-driven perception has strong potential to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy learning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

*Yunxiang Liu,Hongkuo Niu,Jianlin Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FSN is a flexible trajectory prediction framework that dynamically adjusts output time steps using an Adaptive Prediction Module and Dynamic Decoder, with a scoring mechanism balancing prediction length and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trajectory prediction models use fixed-length outputs which limit adaptability to dynamic real-world scenarios in autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: FlexiSteps Network (FSN) with Adaptive Prediction Module to dynamically adjust output steps, Dynamic Decoder for plug-and-play capability, and scoring mechanism using Fr√©chet distance and step length consideration.

Result: Extensive experiments on Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets demonstrate effectiveness and flexibility of the FSN framework.

Conclusion: FSN provides a novel solution for dynamic trajectory prediction with adaptive output steps, improving accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

### [621] [Egocentric Instruction-oriented Affordance Prediction via Large Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17922)
*Bokai Ji,Jie Gu,Xiaokang Ma,Chu Tang,Jingmin Chen,Guangxia Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task-/instruction-dependent affordance prediction approach for robot manipulation, creating a dataset of 15K object-instruction-affordance triplets and proposing a "search against verifiers" pipeline using large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current affordance prediction methods overlook that affordance should be task-dependent - different instructions should lead to different manipulation regions and directions for the same object, which is crucial for intelligent robot manipulation.

Method: Created a dataset with 15K object-instruction-affordance triplets from egocentric viewpoints. Implemented a "search against verifiers" pipeline where large multimodal models progressively predict affordances and verify their own outputs iteratively, mimicking a reasoning process.

Result: The method successfully unlocks new instruction-oriented affordance prediction capabilities and achieves outstanding performance broadly across experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that task-dependent affordance prediction is essential for intelligent robot manipulation and that large multimodal models can effectively serve as affordance predictors through iterative self-verification processes.

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Motivation: To develop a comprehensive perception framework that optimizes both internal cabin experience and external environmental awareness for autonomous vehicles using AI technologies.

Method: Uses multi-camera setup with facial recognition and LLM virtual assistant for internal monitoring, AI sensors for air quality/thermal comfort, and LiDAR-based semantic segmentation with super-resolution for external environment perception.

Result: Successfully integrated and deployed on a real electric vehicle, with experimental validation showing increased performance and efficiency of the modular perception architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed holistic perception system demonstrates effective AI-leveraged monitoring capabilities for both internal and external vehicle environments, providing a self-adaptive framework for advanced autonomous vehicle technologies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external
monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel
AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and
solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring
system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying
driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition
a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring
system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform
thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,
external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D
point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of
EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on
a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and
evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy,
highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the
proposed perception architecture.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability estimation using footprint, LiDAR, and camera data with vision foundation model for labeling, achieving 88% IoU and 1.6-3.5% improvement over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods fail to capture non-traversable regions and focus on single modalities, missing the complementary benefits of heterogeneous sensors for robust traversability estimation.

Method: Proposes multimodal annotation pipeline using footprint, LiDAR, and camera data with vision foundation model to generate traversability labels. Trains dual-stream network that learns from different modalities decoupled, with sparse LiDAR supervision to reduce pseudo-label noise.

Result: Automatic labeling achieves ~88% IoU across diverse datasets. Multimodal network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by 1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets compared to existing self-supervised SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal self-supervised framework effectively integrates heterogeneous sensory modalities and addresses limitations of prior single-modality approaches, demonstrating superior performance in traversability estimation across various environments.

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Arnold is a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments in musculoskeletal control, achieving expert performance in 14 challenging tasks through behavior cloning, PPO fine-tuning, and a novel sensorimotor vocabulary with transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning policies for musculoskeletal models are specialists that excel at single skills but lack generalization. There's a need for a generalist approach that can handle multiple tasks and embodiments efficiently.

Method: Combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO. Uses a novel sensorimotor vocabulary - a compositional representation of sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Employs transformer architecture to handle variable observation and action spaces across different tasks.

Result: Achieves expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks including dexterous object manipulation and locomotion. Supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.

Conclusion: Arnold provides a framework for generalist musculoskeletal control and offers insights into biological motor control, confirming limited transferability of muscle synergies across different tasks.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

*Haoyuan Deng,Wenkai Guo,Qianzhun Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Ziwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeBimanual is a test-time trajectory optimization framework that adds safety constraints to diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies to prevent dangerous behaviors and improve success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies ignore physical safety constraints, leading to dangerous behaviors that can damage robots and objects during complex coordination tasks.

Method: The framework uses diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns, optimizes trajectories through guided sampling of diffusion denoising process, and employs a vision-language model to dynamically schedule cost functions by specifying keypoints and pairwise relationships.

Result: SafeBimanual achieved a 13.7% increase in success rate and 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions on 8 simulated tasks, and improved success rate by 32.5% on 4 real-world tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed safety-constrained framework significantly enhances both safety and performance of diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes a variational framework for modeling posterior predictive distribution to obtain uncertainty-aware predictions in graph-level learning tasks using GNN embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for graph neural networks are designed for node/link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning problems, which is crucial for model safety and user understanding of prediction confidence.

Method: A novel variational modeling framework for posterior predictive distribution based on graph-level embeddings derived from existing GNNs, learning the distribution in a data-adaptive fashion.

Result: Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for uncertainty-aware graph-level predictions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the gap in uncertainty quantification for graph-level learning tasks and provides effective uncertainty-aware predictions using GNN embeddings.

Abstract: Accurate modelling and quantification of predictive uncertainty is crucial in
deep learning since it allows a model to make safer decisions when the data is
ambiguous and facilitates the users' understanding of the model's confidence in
its predictions. Along with the tremendously increasing research focus on
\emph{graph neural networks} (GNNs) in recent years, there have been numerous
techniques which strive to capture the uncertainty in their predictions.
However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for node or
link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational modelling framework for
the \emph{posterior predictive distribution}~(PPD) to obtain uncertainty-aware
prediction in graph-level learning tasks. Based on a graph-level embedding
derived from one of the existing GNNs, our framework can learn the PPD in a
data-adaptive fashion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
exhibit the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Label refinement and weak training for LLM alignment have irreducible error gaps compared to oracle methods, motivating new approaches that combine practicality with optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-produced data limits aligned LLMs to human-level capabilities, creating a superalignment problem that needs methods to surpass human performance.

Method: Adopts probabilistic assumptions from label refinement studies to analyze whether refinement can be outperformed by oracle methods and alternative approaches.

Result: Both weak training and label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap between these methods and computationally intractable oracle procedures.

Conclusion: Future research should develop alternative methods for weak-to-strong generalization that synthesize the practicality of label refinement/weak training with the optimality of oracle procedures.

Abstract: Standard techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) utilize
human-produced data, which could limit the capability of any aligned LLM to
human level. Label refinement and weak training have emerged as promising
strategies to address this superalignment problem. In this work, we adopt
probabilistic assumptions commonly used to study label refinement and analyze
whether refinement can be outperformed by alternative approaches, including
computationally intractable oracle methods. We show that both weak training and
label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap
between label refinement and the oracle. These results motivate future research
into developing alternative methods for weak to strong generalization that
synthesize the practicality of label refinement or weak training and the
optimality of the oracle procedure.

TL;DR: CP4SBI is a conformal calibration framework that improves the calibration of simulation-based inference (SBI) posterior approximations, providing finite-sample local coverage guarantees for various credible regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBI methods often produce miscalibrated posterior approximations, causing credible regions to undercover true parameters, which undermines reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: Two model-agnostic variants: local calibration via regression trees and CDF-based calibration, which construct credible sets with local Bayesian coverage for any scoring function.

Result: Experiments on SBI benchmarks show improved uncertainty quantification quality for neural posterior estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.

Conclusion: CP4SBI provides a practical solution to calibration issues in SBI, enabling reliable uncertainty quantification with finite-sample guarantees across different posterior approximation methods.

Abstract: Current experimental scientists have been increasingly relying on
simulation-based inference (SBI) to invert complex non-linear models with
intractable likelihoods. However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI
are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true
parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal
calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian
coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression
trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees
for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions.
Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior

Motivation: Address limitations of current SDE approaches including instability, poor inductive bias outside bounded domains, and reliance on restrictive dynamics or training tricks

Method: Novel class of neural SDEs constrained to compact polyhedral spaces with continuous dynamics

Result: Enables higher-order solvers and provides favorable inductive bias

Conclusion: The proposed approach overcomes key limitations of existing SDE methods while maintaining interpretability and applicability

Abstract: Many modern probabilistic models rely on SDEs, but their adoption is hampered
by instability, poor inductive bias outside bounded domains, and reliance on
restrictive dynamics or training tricks. While recent work constrains SDEs to
compact spaces using reflected dynamics, these approaches lack continuous

spaces with continuous dynamics, amenable to higher-order solvers, and with
favorable inductive bias.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new differential privacy definition using Rao distance from information geometry instead of traditional divergence measures, offering improved sequential composition properties while maintaining privacy interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differential privacy definitions rely on density divergences, but the authors seek to explore information geometry perspectives to potentially improve composition results and provide alternative formalizations.

Method: The authors define privacy using Rao distance from information geometry rather than traditional divergence measures, applying this geometric perspective to differential privacy.

Result: The proposed Rao distance-based privacy definition maintains the privacy interpretation of previous definitions while achieving improved sequential composition properties.

Conclusion: Information geometry provides a valuable alternative perspective for defining differential privacy, with Rao distance offering advantages in composition while preserving core privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to
release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an
individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate
obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the
original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These
alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on
composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far
nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the
basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry
perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define
privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that
our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous
definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: FIDDLE uses factor-augmented deep learning (FAST-NN) for double/debiased estimation of average treatment effects in high-dimensional, correlated, nonlinear settings, achieving semiparametric efficiency and robustness to model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimate average treatment effects (ATE) in complex settings with high-dimensional, correlated covariates that may have sparse nonlinear effects on both propensity scores and outcomes, where traditional methods struggle.

Method: Proposes FIDDLE estimator using FAST-NN (factor-augmented deep learning) for both response functions and propensity scores within AIPW framework, enabling nonparametric variable selection and adaptive learning of low-dimensional structures.

Result: FIDDLE consistently estimates ATE even under model misspecification, achieves semiparametric efficiency under flexible model families, and outperforms traditional methods especially in high-dimensional settings across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The FIDDLE method provides a robust and efficient approach for ATE estimation in complex high-dimensional settings with nonlinear relationships, demonstrating superior performance over conventional alternatives.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE)
under a very general setup where the covariates can be high-dimensional, highly
correlated, and can have sparse nonlinear effects on the propensity and outcome
models. We present the use of a Double Deep Learning strategy for estimation,
which involves combining recently developed factor-augmented deep
learning-based estimators, FAST-NN, for both the response functions and
propensity scores to achieve our goal. By using FAST-NN, our method can select
variables that contribute to propensity and outcome models in a completely
nonparametric and algorithmic manner and adaptively learn low-dimensional
function structures through neural networks. Our proposed novel estimator,
FIDDLE (Factor Informed Double Deep Learning Estimator), estimates ATE based on
the framework of augmented inverse propensity weighting AIPW with the
FAST-NN-based response and propensity estimates. FIDDLE consistently estimates
ATE even under model misspecification and is flexible to also allow for
low-dimensional covariates. Our method achieves semiparametric efficiency under
a very flexible family of propensity and outcome models. We present extensive
numerical studies on synthetic and real datasets to support our theoretical
guarantees and establish the advantages of our methods over other traditional
choices, especially when the data dimension is large.

*Tobias Wegel,Geelon So,Junhyung Park,Fanny Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes multi-objective learning (MOL) and shows that while some losses require complex models with high statistical cost, Bregman losses allow leveraging unlabeled data to reduce labeled data requirements through pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective learning requires balancing competing prediction tasks with a single model, which typically demands larger model capacity and increases statistical complexity costs. The paper aims to understand when and how unlabeled data can mitigate these costs.

Method: The authors analyze MOL complexity bounds, prove theoretical results about unavoidable costs for some losses, and establish that for Bregman losses, model complexity only affects unlabeled data requirements. They propose a semi-supervised pseudo-labeling algorithm.

Result: The paper shows that for Bregman losses, unlabeled data can significantly reduce the need for labeled data, with established sample complexity upper bounds demonstrating this trade-off.

Conclusion: While some MOL losses inherently require complex models with high statistical costs, Bregman losses enable effective semi-supervised learning where unlabeled data alleviates labeled data requirements through pseudo-labeling approaches.

Abstract: In multi-objective learning (MOL), several possibly competing prediction
tasks must be solved jointly by a single model. Achieving good trade-offs may
require a model class $\mathcal{G}$ with larger capacity than what is necessary
for solving the individual tasks. This, in turn, increases the statistical
cost, as reflected in known MOL bounds that depend on the complexity of
$\mathcal{G}$. We show that this cost is unavoidable for some losses, even in
an idealized semi-supervised setting, where the learner has access to the
Bayes-optimal solutions for the individual tasks as well as the marginal
distributions over the covariates. On the other hand, for objectives defined
with Bregman losses, we prove that the complexity of $\mathcal{G}$ may come
into play only in terms of unlabeled data. Concretely, we establish sample
complexity upper bounds, showing precisely when and how unlabeled data can
significantly alleviate the need for labeled data. These rates are achieved by
a simple, semi-supervised algorithm via pseudo-labeling.

Motivation: To systematically analyze the loss landscape of ReLU perceptrons with RR-MSE by leveraging the piecewise polynomial nature of the objective function, enabling identification of both isolated and higher-dimensional minima that numerical methods might miss.

Method: Developed a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy using computational algebraic tools to exhaustively enumerate all local minima. The approach treats the RR-MSE as a piecewise polynomial function and applies algebraic methods to find all critical points.

Result: The method successfully identifies both zero-dimensional (isolated) and higher-dimensional (curves, surfaces, hypersurfaces) local minima. Applied as proof-of-concept to minimal perceptrons with few hidden units, though computationally intensive for practical-sized networks.

Conclusion: Computational algebraic methods provide a systematic way to analyze the complete loss landscape of ReLU perceptrons, revealing complex structures including higher-dimensional minima that traditional numerical optimization might overlook, though scalability remains a challenge for larger networks.

Abstract: This paper investigates a perceptron, a simple neural network model, with
ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our
approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise
polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational
algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that
exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the
algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical
zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical
optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as
curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods
are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a
proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal
perceptrons with a few hidden units.

### [634] [High-Order Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17545)
*Thanh Dang,Mert Gurbuzbalaban,Mohammad Rafiqul Islam,Nian Yao,Lingjiong Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes higher-order (P‚â•3) Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms with improved convergence rates for sampling from log-concave smooth densities, showing better dimension and accuracy scaling as order increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Langevin algorithms are widely used MCMC methods for large-scale sampling in data science, but existing methods have limitations in convergence rates and dimensional dependence that higher-order discretizations could improve.

Method: Combines splitting techniques and accurate integration methods to design P-th order Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms based on discretizations of P-th order Langevin dynamics.

Result: Achieves Wasserstein convergence with mixing time scaling as O(d^(1/R)/Œµ^(1/2R)) where R depends on P, showing improved dependence on dimension d and accuracy Œµ as P increases. Numerical experiments confirm efficiency.

Conclusion: Higher-order Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms provide superior convergence properties for sampling from log-concave smooth distributions, with better dimensional scaling and accuracy as the order P grows.

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for
large-scale sampling problems that often arise in data science. We propose
Monte Carlo algorithms based on the discretizations of $P$-th order Langevin
dynamics for any $P\geq 3$. Our design of $P$-th order Langevin Monte Carlo
(LMC) algorithms is by combining splitting and accurate integration methods. We
obtain Wasserstein convergence guarantees for sampling from distributions with
log-concave and smooth densities. Specifically, the mixing time of the $P$-th
order LMC algorithm scales as
$O\left(d^{\frac{1}{R}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2R}}\right)$ for $R=4\cdot 1_{\{
P=3\}}+ (2P-1)\cdot 1_{\{ P\geq 4\}}$, which has a better dependence on the
dimension $d$ and the accuracy level $\epsilon$ as $P$ grows. Numerical
experiments illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

### [635] [The Statistical Fairness-Accuracy Frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17622)
*Alireza Fallah,Michael I. Jordan,Annie Ulichney*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the fairness-accuracy frontier in finite-sample settings, showing deviations from population-level theory and providing minimax-optimal estimators for practical algorithm design with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models face trade-offs between accuracy and fairness, especially with multiple demographic groups. Existing fairness-accuracy frontier analysis assumes complete population knowledge, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to make this theoretical construct practical for real-world applications with limited data.

Method: The authors study the FA frontier in finite-sample regimes, derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on covariate distribution knowledge, characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact group risks, and identify optimal sample allocation strategies.

Result: The research quantifies the worst-case gap between population and finite-sample FA frontiers, provides estimators that account for limited data, and shows how sample size affects different demographic groups unequally.

Conclusion: The work transforms the fairness-accuracy frontier from a theoretical concept into a practical tool for policymakers and practitioners who must design algorithms with limited data, addressing real-world constraints in fairness-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals
often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A
useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA)
frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously
improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier
provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of
population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in
the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population
counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we
derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of
the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how
finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify
optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier
from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and
practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.

TL;DR: Large Brazilian ICU study identifies risk factors for dengue complications: age >80, chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, low platelets, high leukocytes. Machine learning tool developed for early prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brazil reports 71% of global dengue cases in 2024, making severe dengue a major public health concern requiring better understanding of ICU outcomes and risk factors.

Method: Prospective study of 11,047 dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals using descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and machine learning framework for complication prediction.

Result: 10.1% of admissions developed complications including ventilation, vasopressor use, transfusions, and renal therapy. Key risk factors identified with significant odds ratios (age>80: OR 3.10, CKD: OR 2.94, liver cirrhosis: OR 3.65, low platelets: OR 2.25, high leukocytes: OR 2.47).

Conclusion: Study provides comprehensive profile of severe dengue ICU patients and identifies critical risk factors. The machine learning prediction tool enables early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in dengue-endemic regions.

Abstract: Background. Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil
reporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the
profile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units
(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications
while in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop
complications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of
dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive
statistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to
identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine
learning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.
Visualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047
admissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including
non-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor
(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:
3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver
cirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:
2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)
were significant risk factors for complications. A machine learning tool for
predicting complications was proposed, showing accurate discrimination and
calibration. Conclusion. We described a large cohort of dengue patients
admitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue
complications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of
leukocytes and lower level of platelets. The proposed prediction tool can be
used for early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in
dengue-endemic regions.

*Rijha Safdar,Danyail Mateen,Syed Taha Ali,M. Umer Ashfaq,Wajahat Hussain*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Improving data quality and using encoder-based models enhances AI vulnerability detection system generalization across unseen C/C++ codebases, achieving 6.8% recall improvement on BigVul benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based vulnerability detection systems suffer from poor generalization to unknown codebases, limiting their practical effectiveness in real-world software security applications.

Method: Conducted experiments comparing data quality improvements and different model architectures (encoder-only vs decoder-only models) to evaluate their impact on cross-project generalization for C/C++ vulnerability detection.

Result: Encoder-based models outperformed decoder-only models in accuracy and generalization. The approach achieved 6.8% improvement in recall on BigVul dataset and demonstrated better performance on unseen software projects.

Conclusion: Data quality and appropriate model selection (encoder-based architectures) are crucial for developing robust vulnerability detection systems with high cross-project effectiveness, providing direction for future research.

Abstract: The performance of AI-based software vulnerability detection systems is often
limited by their poor generalization to unknown codebases. In this research, we
explore the impact of data quality and model architecture on the
generalizability of vulnerability detection systems. By generalization we mean
ability of high vulnerability detection performance across different C/C++
software projects not seen during training. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate that improvements in dataset diversity and quality substantially
enhance detection performance. Additionally, we compare multiple encoder-only
and decoder-only models, finding that encoder based models outperform in terms
of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves 6.8% improvement in recall
on the benchmark BigVul[1] dataset, also outperforming on unseen projects,
hence showing enhanced generalizability. These results highlight the role of
data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability
detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems having

*GodsGift Uzor,Hasan Al-Qudah,Ynes Ineza,Abdul Serwadda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM gatekeeper - a local lightweight model that filters sensitive information from user queries before sending to cloud LLMs, enhancing privacy without compromising response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs collect extensive user data and context, creating privacy risks even with opt-out settings, especially in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, surveillance, or poor data security practices.

Method: A dual-model approach using a locally run lightweight 'gatekeeper' model that filters sensitive information from queries before they reach the cloud-based LLM.

Result: Experiments with human subjects show minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without compromising the quality of LLM responses.

Conclusion: The LLM gatekeeper concept provides effective privacy protection for users interacting with cloud-based LLMs in untrustworthy environments, balancing privacy and functionality.

Abstract: The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which closely track
user data and context, has prompted users to share personal and private
information in unprecedented ways. Even when users opt out of allowing their
data to be used for training, these privacy settings offer limited protection
when LLM providers operate in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, invasive
government surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the
risk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information
(PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose
the concept of an "LLM gatekeeper", a lightweight, locally run model that
filters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the
potentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through
experiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach
introduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without
compromising the quality of LLM responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice authentication has expanded across multiple domains but faces growing security threats as technology advances, requiring comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities and countermeasures.

Method: Chronological analysis of voice authentication development, systematic review of attack methodologies, comparison of performance using common datasets, and organization using established taxonomies.

Result: Comprehensive mapping of modern threat landscape, highlighting evolving vulnerabilities and providing organized framework for understanding different attack categories and their limitations.

Conclusion: The survey identifies emerging risks and open challenges to support development of more secure and resilient voice authentication systems in response to evolving threats.

Abstract: Voice authentication has undergone significant changes from traditional

applications across finance, smart devices, law enforcement, and beyond.
However, as adoption has grown, so have the threats. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of the modern threat landscape targeting Voice

chronologically trace the development of voice authentication and examine how
vulnerabilities have evolved in tandem with technological advancements. For
each category of attack, we summarize methodologies, highlight commonly used
datasets, compare performance and limitations, and organize existing literature
using widely accepted taxonomies. By highlighting emerging risks and open
challenges, this survey aims to support the development of more secure and
resilient voice authentication systems.

*Derek Lilienthal,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: First study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM agents, introducing TOCTOU-Bench benchmark and proposing detection/mitigation techniques that reduce vulnerabilities from 12% to 8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-enabled agents are widely deployed but vulnerable to time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks, which remain largely unexplored despite security implications.

Method: Developed TOCTOU-Bench with 66 realistic user tasks, adapted systems security techniques (prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, tool-fusing) for LLM agents.

Result: Achieved 25% detection accuracy, 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, 95% reduction in attack window, and reduced TOCTOU vulnerabilities from 12% to 8% when combining all approaches.

Conclusion: Opens new research direction at intersection of AI safety and systems security, demonstrating practical TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM agents and effective countermeasures.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents are rapidly emerging across a wide
range of applications, but their deployment introduces vulnerabilities with
security implications. While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks
(e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration),
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this
context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or
API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks
such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we
present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We
introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to
evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection
and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose
prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study
highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25%
detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in
vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When
combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an
executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction
at the intersection of AI safety and systems security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the under-explored privacy risks in Graph RAG systems that emerge from moving from plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal, specifically focusing on data extraction vulnerabilities.

Method: Designed and executed tailored data extraction attacks to probe Graph RAG systems' susceptibility to leaking both raw text and structured data (entities and relationships).

Result: Found that Graph RAG systems reduce raw text leakage but are significantly more vulnerable to extraction of structured entity and relationship information, revealing a critical privacy trade-off.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational analysis of unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for building more secure systems, including exploring potential defense mechanisms to mitigate these novel attack surfaces.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enhancing
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date knowledge. Graph RAG has
emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures
to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from
plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new,
under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction
vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data
extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and
structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal
a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they
are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and
relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to
mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational
analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for
building more secure systems.

TL;DR: Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA) are new LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs through third-party service hijacking and back-doored open-source checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address an under-explored security gap where attackers can subvert information integrity in LLMs by injecting covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while maintaining normal appearance.

Method: Two attack vectors: hijacking third-party service platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and publishing fine-tuned open-source checkpoints with attacker data. Also proposes prompt-based self-inspection defense.

Result: AEA successfully inject malicious content without degrading model accuracy, revealing a significant security vulnerability in current LLM systems.

Conclusion: Urgent need for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community to address this emerging threat to information integrity in LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM
security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into
model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1)
hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial
prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with
attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert
information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate
speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five
stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection
defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining.
Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for
coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety
community.

Motivation: Address the shortage of labeled malicious samples for training intrusion detection systems, particularly in few-sample learning scenarios.

Method: Collaborative training paradigm with GAN-based discriminator for malicious pattern recognition and LLM-based generator for malicious code synthesis using reward signals.

Result: Highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection capabilities even with limited labeled samples.

Conclusion: Offers a promising solution for developing adaptive defense systems against evolving cyber threats through dual enhancement capability.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security
defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models
is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework
\textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL
Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios.
Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1)
the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through
adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2)
the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using
reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate
that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is
highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection
capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for
developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber
threats.

Conclusion: The graph-driven, ensemble-based approach enables interpretable attack path forecasting and strengthens proactive cyber defense capabilities.

Abstract: The escalating complexity and volume of cyberattacks demand proactive
detection strategies that go beyond traditional rule-based systems. This paper
presents a phase-aware, multi-model machine learning framework that emulates
adversarial behavior across the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain using the

Inter-phase dependencies are modeled using directed graphs to capture attacker
movement from reconnaissance to objectives. The ensemble consistently achieved
the highest scores, with F1-scores ranging from 97.47% to 99.83%, surpassing
GNN performance (97.36% to 99.81%) by 0.03%--0.20% across phases. This

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of deep learning-based point cloud denoising methods, organized by supervision level and modeling perspective, with unified benchmarking and analysis of current trends and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw point clouds in real-world applications are often corrupted by noise from various sources, reducing geometric fidelity and degrading downstream performance. While classical optimization methods struggle with complex noise patterns, deep learning approaches show strong results but need systematic review and benchmarking.

Method: Organizes literature from two perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2) modeling perspective with a functional taxonomy. Establishes unified benchmark with consistent training settings and evaluates methods across denoising quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.

Result: Provides comprehensive review of deep learning-based point cloud denoising methods up to August 2025, analyzing architectural trends both structurally and chronologically.

Conclusion: Discusses open challenges and outlines future research directions in the rapidly evolving field of point cloud denoising, emphasizing the need for continued advancement in handling diverse noise patterns and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research

### [648] [DanceEditor: Towards Iterative Editable Music-driven Dance Generation with Open-Vocabulary Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17342)
*Hengyuan Zhang,Zhe Li,Xingqun Qi,Mengze Li,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Sirui Han*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A framework for iterative and editable dance generation from music with text-based editing capabilities, using a novel dataset and cross-modality editing module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dance synthesis methods lack practical editing capabilities needed for real-world choreography scenarios, and there's a lack of high-quality datasets supporting iterative editing.

Method: Proposes DanceEditor framework with prediction-then-editing paradigm: initial music-to-dance prediction followed by iterative text-based editing using Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM) that integrates music, text, and initial predictions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on the newly collected DanceRemix dataset (25.3M dance frames, 84.5K pairs), generating music-harmonic dances with fine-grained semantic alignment to text descriptions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables iterative and editable dance generation that coherently aligns with music signals while allowing user-guided editing through text descriptions.

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

*Hanzhi Chang,Ruijie Zhu,Wenjie Chang,Mulin Yu,Yanzhe Liang,Jiahao Lu,Zhuoyuan Li,Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MeshSplat is a novel framework that uses 2D Gaussian Splatting to achieve accurate surface reconstruction from extremely sparse input views, eliminating the need for 3D ground-truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surface reconstruction methods struggle with accurate geometry recovery when input views are extremely sparse, creating a need for better sparse-view reconstruction techniques.

Method: Leverages 2DGS as a bridge between novel view synthesis and geometric priors, uses feed-forward network for per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS prediction, Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss for depth regularization, and normal prediction network for orientation alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MeshSplat provides an effective solution for sparse-view surface reconstruction by connecting novel view synthesis with learned geometric priors through 2D Gaussian Splatting, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

### [651] [Integrative Experiments Identify How Punishment Impacts Welfare in Public Goods Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17151)
*Mohammed Alsobay,David G. Rand,Duncan J. Watts,Abdullah Almaatouq*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: Punishment effectiveness in promoting cooperation varies dramatically across contexts, ranging from +43% to -44% efficiency impact, with communication being the most predictive factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing dispute about punishment's effectiveness in promoting cooperation by examining how its impact varies across different cooperative settings.

Method: Large-scale integrative experiment with 360 conditions sampling 14 parameters of public goods games, collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants, and developing predictive models.

Result: Punishment consistently increases contributions but has highly variable efficiency effects. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, with most factors interacting rather than operating independently.

Conclusion: The debate should shift from whether punishment works to the specific conditions under which it works, and integrative experiments with machine learning can uncover complex patterns in social phenomena.

Abstract: Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied
extensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter
of dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative
settings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters
that characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and
collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal
striking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment
consistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)
ranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely
undermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To
characterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human
forecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in
new experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed
by contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.
all-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility
(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a
reward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to
influence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For
example, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of
punishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results
refocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it "works" to the
specific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our
study demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine
learning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions
between multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex
social phenomena.

### [652] [A Decoupled LOB Representation Framework for Multilevel Manipulation Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086)
*Yushi Lin,Peng Yang*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: A novel representation learning framework combining cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning to detect spoofing manipulation in financial markets, achieving state-of-the-art results with Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial markets suffer from trade-based manipulation like spoofing, which exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns concealed within high-dimensional, noisy Limit Order Book data that current methods fail to adequately model.

Method: Proposed a representation learning framework with cascaded LOB representation pipeline and supervised contrastive learning to extract hierarchical patterns from complex order book data.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results in spoofing detection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses multilevel anomaly detection in financial markets and offers broader insights for representation learning and anomaly detection in complex sequential data.

Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based
manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly
deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been
adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich,
hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to
leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a
representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation
pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance
across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving
state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and
ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of
key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and
anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later
at this URL.

*Nikita Stroev,Natalia G. Berloff*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Unified photonic platform for k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN learning using a single SLM with folded 4f relay, enabling parallel discrete-continuous workflows with physical gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a convergence point between discrete Ising optimization and continuous KAN function learning on a single photonic platform, enabling interleaved workflows without requiring nonlinear media.

Method: Uses a single spatial light modulator with folded 4f relay that reimages Fourier plane onto SLM, creating disjoint windows for spin cliques/ridge channels. Each window gets its own phase patch, making measured intensity a programmable polynomial while maintaining linear optical field propagation.

Result: Achieves native k-local couplings without nonlinear media and parallel independent univariate nonlinearities for KAN layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame physical gradients.

Conclusion: Minimal hardware overhead (one extra lens and fold) enables massively parallel high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable all-optical KAN processing on existing photonic platforms.

Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a
single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical
computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce
a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one
stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical
Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert
structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a
per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same
spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane
onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a
disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains
linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes
a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude.
This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and,
in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN
layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame
(forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial
photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft
analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens
and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively
parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable,
all-optical KAN processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The VGGSound dataset has limitations including incomplete labeling, overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities that distort evaluation of audio-visual models.

Method: Created VGGSounder by comprehensively re-annotating VGGSound with multi-label classification, detailed modality annotations, and introduced a new modality confusion metric.

Result: Provides a more reliable benchmark for evaluating audio-visual foundation models with precise modality-specific performance analysis.

Conclusion: VGGSounder addresses critical limitations in existing benchmarks and enables more accurate assessment of multi-modal understanding in foundation models.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of
reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is
commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.
However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including
incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.
These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively
re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically
designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features
detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific
performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance
degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion
metric.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Regression models (especially LSTM) outperform classification models for predicting VR user intentions from hand movement data, with timing errors <0.25s and distance errors 5-20cm in critical pre-grasp window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting user intentions in VR is crucial for immersive experiences, particularly for complex grasping motions requiring accurate haptic feedback.

Method: Evaluated classification and regression approaches using time-series hand movement data from 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Used LSTM networks for regression.

Result: Classification models struggled to generalize across users, while regression approaches (especially LSTM) showed robust performance with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm before grasp.

Conclusion: Regression models better accommodate dynamic user behavior in VR, showing potential for enhancing VR interactions through adaptive haptic feedback and laying groundwork for real-time prediction advancements.

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating
immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions
where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage
time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and
regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and
manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to
generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast,
regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within
0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second
window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand
postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user
variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and
how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user
behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models
to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and
lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user
actions in VR.

TL;DR: Humans struggle to identify causal relationships in AI reasoning text, with only 29.3% accuracy, challenging the utility of reasoning text as an interpretability tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human understanding of AI reasoning text corresponds to the model's actual computational process, particularly focusing on the ability to identify causal influences between reasoning steps.

Method: Evaluated humans on identifying which steps in reasoning text causally influence later steps using questions based on counterfactual measurements.

Result: Human accuracy was only 29.3% (barely above 25% chance), remaining low at 42% even with majority voting on high-agreement questions.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental gap between human interpretation and model computation in reasoning texts, suggesting they should be treated as artifacts for investigation rather than taken at face value.

Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before
producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into
their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and
interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this
text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we
investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to
identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We
evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual
measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only
29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating
the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a
fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use
it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that
reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken
at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use
language is a critical research direction.

Method: Proposes an embodied AR navigation system integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Uses three language agents (Triage, Search, Response) built on LLMs for open-ended query interpretation and spatial reasoning. Delivers guidance through embodied AR agent with voice interaction and locomotion.

Result: Real-world user study yields System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80.5 (excellent usability). Comparative evaluations show embodied interface significantly improves users' perception of system intelligence.

Conclusion: Language-grounded reasoning and embodiment are crucial for designing user-centered AR navigation systems, demonstrating the importance of flexible language interaction and embodied agents in enhancing user experience.

Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented
reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of
interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic
context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or
predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder
natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system
that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible,
language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates
three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language
models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and
spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an
embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance
user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)
score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show
that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of
system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of
language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR
navigation systems.

Method: Deep learning-based multimodal appearance-based gaze control with standard camera hardware, featuring synchronous and asynchronous command selection modes and a menu-based virtual keyboard supporting 56 English characters.

Result: Achieved average typing speeds: 18.3 letters/min (mouse), 12.6 letters/min (eye-tracker sync), 10.94 letters/min (webcam sync), 11.15 letters/min (eye-tracker async), 7.86 letters/min (webcam async). ITR of 63.56 bits/min at letter level with webcam sync. Demonstrated good usability and low workload.

Conclusion: The system shows promise as an accessible communication tool in low-resource settings, offering user-centered design with standard webcam hardware rather than specialized eye-tracking equipment.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased
among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has
emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however,
traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy
issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command
sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual
keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera
hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command
selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with
nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters,
including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function
for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied
participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input
modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam.
Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate
(ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31
letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94
+- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min
(eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam,
asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level)
and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The
system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input,
highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication
tool in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI social media recommendations often fail to match user interests and lack transparency as black box systems, creating unpleasant experiences and comprehensibility issues.

Method: Qualitative analysis using Facebook platform with regular users, asking about content suggestions, comprehensibility, and explainability through user interviews.

Result: Users require explanations for unfamiliar content and data security, prefer concise non-technical explanations with controlled information flow, and explanations impact perception of transparency, trust, and understandability.

Conclusion: Design implications and a synthesized framework are presented to address user needs for explainable AI recommendations that enhance transparency and user control.

Abstract: AI based social media recommendations have great potential to improve the
user experience. However, often these recommendations do not match the user
interest and create an unpleasant experience for the users. Moreover, the
recommendation system being a black box creates comprehensibility and
transparency issues. This paper investigates social media recommendations from
an end user perspective. For the investigation, we used the popular social
media platform Facebook and recruited regular users to conduct a qualitative
analysis. We asked participants about the social media content suggestions,
their comprehensibility, and explainability. Our analysis shows users mostly
require explanation whenever they encounter unfamiliar content and to ensure
their online data security. Furthermore, the users require concise,
non-technical explanations along with the facility of controlled information
flow. In addition, we observed that explanations impact the users perception of
transparency, trust, and understandability. Finally, we have outlined some
design implications and presented a synthesized framework based on our data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users need to navigate multiple steps to access specific text boxes for different app functionalities. TextOnly aims to provide a single text portal for accessing various text-related functions across applications.

Method: Integrates large language models (LLMs) for general knowledge and BERT model for learning user-specific preferences. Uses raw text inputs to interpret user intentions and trigger appropriate application functions.

Result: Achieved top-1 accuracy of 71.35% in real-world user studies. System continuously improves both accuracy and inference speed. Participants preferred TextOnly over manual execution and found it more usable than voice assistants.

Conclusion: TextOnly provides an effective unified portal for text-related functions, supporting more functions than voice assistants while allowing concise inputs. The hybrid LLM+BERT approach enables continuous learning and performance improvement.

Abstract: Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone
applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always
need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for
input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to
access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting
text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could
trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in
WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these
raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions
effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model.
The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can
continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions.
Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1
accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy
and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory
usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions.
Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of
text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomechanical models for HCI have limited interaction fidelity, require simplified models, and don't generalize well for precise movements like touchscreen interactions.

Method: Proposed curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations, and simulation environment adjustments for training biomechanical models using reinforcement learning.

Result: Significantly improved agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior in touchscreen pointing tasks, enabling use of more complex biomechanical models with better fidelity.

Conclusion: Provides HCI researchers with practical training routines and tips for developing better biomechanical models with human-like interaction fidelity for touchscreen and mobile device interactions.

Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the
generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training
biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly
for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen
interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their
interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to
reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose
practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase
interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more
complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate
that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations,
and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve
the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI
researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better
biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

TL;DR: Miffie is an automated database normalization framework using LLMs with dual-model self-refinement architecture that generates and verifies normalized schemas until requirements are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual database normalization is time-consuming and error-prone, creating a need for automated solutions that preserve data integrity without human effort.

Method: Uses a dual-model self-refinement architecture combining generation and verification modules with task-specific zero-shot prompts for high accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Miffie successfully automates database normalization using LLMs, achieving high accuracy without human intervention through its self-refining dual-model approach.

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

*Yanwen Wang,Xinglin Zhao,Yijin Song,Xiaobo Liu,Yanrong Hao,Rui Cao,Xin Wen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A modular neuroimaging framework that combines foundation model principles with domain-specific architectures for fMRI analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance in age and cognitive prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying foundation models to fMRI data, including high dimensionality, computational complexity, and difficulties capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect ROI interactions.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for pretraining to reduce HRF influence and suppress noise, 2) Random Walk Mixture of Experts (RWMOE) for clustering features across spatial/temporal dimensions, 3) State-space model (SSM)-based predictor for downstream task inference.

Result: Achieved MAEs of 5.343 for age prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence on Cam-CAN dataset, with PCCs of 0.928 and 0.887 respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis, offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function with enhanced interpretability through expert distribution visualization.

Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI plays a critical
role in personalized predictions such as age and cognitive performance.
However, applying foundation models(FM) to fMRI data remains challenging due to
its high dimensionality, computational complexity, and the difficulty in
capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect region-of-interest (ROI)
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a modular neuroimaging
framework that integrates principles from FM with efficient, domain-specific
architectures. Our approach begins with a Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for
pretraining, which reduces the influence of hemodynamic response function (HRF)
dynamics and suppresses noise. This is followed by a Random Walk Mixture of
Experts (RWMOE) module that clusters features across spatial and temporal
dimensions, effectively capturing intricate brain interactions. Finally, a
state-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference.
Evaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN)
dataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age
prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation
coefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further
enhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides
a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis,
offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.

### [670] [BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667)
*Yifan Li,Javad Sohankar,Ji Luo,Jing Li,Yi Su*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: BrainPath is a 3D generative framework that predicts personalized brain aging trajectories from a single baseline MRI scan, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and capturing realistic aging patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for brain aging prediction are limited to chronological age prediction or synthetic MRI generation that fails to capture subject-specific aging trajectories, which is critical for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and aging heterogeneity.

Method: BrainPath uses a 3D generative framework with age calibration loss, swap learning strategy, and age perceptual loss to learn longitudinal brain aging dynamics and predict anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan.

Result: BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art models across ADNI and NACC datasets in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns.

Conclusion: BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical
for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet
current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an
imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that
enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here,
we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain
aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically
faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath
integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age
perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across
held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms
state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared
error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference
accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns.
Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of
brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based
analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and
supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

### [671] [The Computational Complexity of Satisfiability in State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18162)
*Eric Alsmann,Martin Lange*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The satisfiability problem for State Space Models (ssmSAT) is undecidable in general but becomes decidable under two restrictions: bounded context length (NP-complete/NEXPTIME) and quantised SSM with fixed-width arithmetic (PSPACE-complete/EXPSPACE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational complexity of formal reasoning and verification for State Space Models, particularly in practical settings where restrictions apply.

Method: Theoretical analysis of ssmSAT complexity under different constraints: bounded context length and quantised SSM with fixed-width arithmetic, covering both diagonal gated and time-invariant SSM.

Result: ssmSAT is undecidable generally but decidable under restrictions: NP-complete (unary input length) and NEXPTIME/PSPACE-hard (binary input length) for bounded context; PSPACE-complete/EXPSPACE for quantised SSM depending on bit-width encoding.

Conclusion: This establishes the first complexity landscape for SSM formal reasoning, revealing fundamental verification limits and opportunities for SSM-based language models.

Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem ssmSAT for State
Space Models (SSM), which asks whether an input sequence can lead the model to
an accepting configuration. We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general,
reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we
identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and
establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context
length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in
NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second,
for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is
PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While
these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds
for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for
formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for
the verification of SSM-based language models.

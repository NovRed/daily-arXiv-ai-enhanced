Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the\n``LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator\nto assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various\nbiases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation\nresults. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as\njudges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although\neffective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead\nduring inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue\nevaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by\naggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach\npreserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically\nreducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality\nassessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise\ncomparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its\nefficiency and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator to aggregate multiple LLM judges' knowledge into one model, reducing computational costs while maintaining evaluation quality.", "motivation": "Current LLM-as-a-judge methods suffer from biases and high computational costs, necessitating a more efficient and reliable evaluation approach.", "method": "Aggregates preference knowledge from multiple LLM judges into a single model to capture collective wisdom efficiently.", "result": "Outperforms existing baselines on seven benchmarks, demonstrating efficiency and robustness.", "conclusion": "The proposed method offers a cost-effective and reliable solution for dialogue quality assessment."}}

Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation.

We\naddress the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to\nimprove its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -\nfor example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control\n(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its\nworst-case guarantees across the entire problem class.

In particular, starting\nfrom a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the\nmodifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties.

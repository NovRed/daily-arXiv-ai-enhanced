### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF improves few-shot learning for food images by filtering patch embeddings to focus on class-relevant features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images' complexity and variability cause misclassification in few-shot learning, requiring better focus on key elements.

Method: SPFF uses stochastic filtering to discard less similar patch embeddings and employs a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256.

Conclusion: SPFF effectively addresses food image classification challenges by emphasizing class-specific features.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

TL;DR: DINOv3 is a self-supervised vision foundation model that scales datasets and models effectively, introduces Gram anchoring to improve feature maps, and enhances flexibility, outperforming specialized models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate manual data annotation and enable scalable, versatile visual representation learning from diverse sources.

Method: Scales datasets and models, introduces Gram anchoring for stable feature maps, and applies post-hoc strategies for flexibility.

Result: Outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models across tasks without fine-tuning, delivering high-quality dense features.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning, offering scalable solutions for diverse tasks and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

### [3] [Empowering Morphing Attack Detection using Interpretable Image-Text Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10110)
*Sushrut Patwardhan,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Sushma Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal learning approach for morphing attack detection in face recognition systems, leveraging CLIP for zero-shot evaluation and textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability in face recognition by detecting morphing attacks and providing human-understandable textual descriptions.

Method: Uses Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for zero-shot evaluation, testing ten textual prompts on a face morphing dataset.

Result: Demonstrates generalizable morphing attack detection and predicts relevant text snippets, evaluated on five morphing techniques across three mediums.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects morphing attacks and provides interpretable textual descriptions, improving face recognition system reliability.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models, combining radical and pictographic analysis to improve generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for OBS decipherment lack interpretability and struggle with zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The method involves progressive training (radical to pictographic analysis) and a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism, supported by a new dataset (Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset).

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot performance, with logical analysis processes aiding archaeological research.

Conclusion: The method advances OBS decipherment, offering interpretability and potential applications in digital humanities, with the dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans is developed and validated, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM) in health marker associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans for body composition assessment.

Method: A deep learning approach is trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and validated on an external dataset. The method is then applied to 35,928 scans across five imaging modes for SAM.

Result: The method achieves 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement. SAM features derived from these keypoints show associations with health markers, corroborating existing evidence and generating new hypotheses.

Conclusion: The developed method is highly accurate and useful for SAM in health research, with potential applications in understanding body composition's relationship to health markers.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANGO, a Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow method, to improve explicit and interpretable multimodal fusion learning using novel cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion methods lack explicit feature capture and interpretability, hindering comprehension of complex multimodal structures.

Method: Proposes an Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three cross-attention mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA) within a Normalizing Flow framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification tasks.

Conclusion: MANGO provides a scalable, interpretable solution for multimodal fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores combining real and synthetic images to improve crop disease classification, finding that a hybrid approach enhances model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating real and synthetic images for better disease classification in agriculture, reducing reliance on resource-intensive data collection.

Method: Used an EfficientNetV2-L model with five treatments (varying real-to-synthetic image ratios) and enhanced fine-tuning/transfer learning.

Result: Models with hybrid datasets (H2-H4) outperformed those with only real or synthetic images, achieving higher precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining real and synthetic images maximizes model performance for crop disease classification, as synthetic images alone are insufficient.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic data generation framework to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and object detectors for rare, safety-critical tasks like industrial spill detection, where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of VLMs degrades in niche, safety-critical domains due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and infrequent real incidents, making conventional fine-tuning impractical.

Method: A scalable framework with a high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline is proposed, enabling Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and boosting object detectors like YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data (SynSpill dataset) significantly improves VLMs and detectors, making their performance comparable. VLMs generalize better to unseen scenarios without synthetic data.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data bridges the domain gap in safety-critical applications, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for vision systems in data-scarce industrial environments.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) requires compression for storage/transmission. EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method, reduces data rates by 30x while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to compress 3DGS Gaussian attributes for efficient storage and transmission due to their separation in time or devices.

Method: Correlation and statistical analysis of Gaussian attributes, revealing Laplace and Gaussian distributions. Proposed EntropyGS uses factorized and parameterized entropy coding with adaptive quantization.

Result: 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets with similar rendering quality and fast encoding/decoding.

Conclusion: EntropyGS effectively compresses 3DGS data without compromising visual quality, enabling efficient storage and transmission.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellSymphony integrates Xenium spatial transcriptomics and histology images using foundation models for accurate cell annotation and niche discovery in tumors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting robust cell-level features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data is a challenge.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-derived embeddings to fuse spatial gene expression with morphological context.

Result: Achieves accurate cell type annotation and identifies distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for understanding tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A review of deep learning trends in crack detection, covering learning paradigms, generalizability, and dataset diversification, with a new 3D dataset and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze emerging trends in deep learning for crack detection and introduce a new dataset (3DCrack) to support future research.

Method: Systematic review of trends and benchmarking experiments using the new 3DCrack dataset with deep learning methodologies, including foundation models.

Result: Insights into evolving methodologies and future directions in deep learning-based crack detection, with established baselines for common techniques.

Conclusion: The review highlights shifts in learning paradigms and dataset diversity, offering a foundation for future research with the 3DCrack dataset.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by fusing multi-region predictions using JSD-based reliability weights, improving factuality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinations due to limited ability to verify visual information across image regions.

Method: MRFD uses cross-attention to identify salient regions, generates per-region responses, weights them via JSD, and fuses predictions with region-aware prompts.

Result: MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factual grounding across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MRFD is an effective, training-free method for enhancing LVLM factuality by leveraging inter-region consistency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [13] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation across individuals by proposing a dynamic calibration strategy that improves robustness to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PoG estimators struggle with generalization due to personal differences and sensitivity to head pose variations, necessitating person-specific calibration.

Method: The authors construct the MobilePoG benchmark with facial images from 32 individuals under varied head poses. They analyze calibration point and pose diversity, then propose a dynamic calibration strategy involving phone movement.

Result: Experiments show that wider head pose diversity during calibration improves estimator robustness. The dynamic strategy outperforms conventional methods in handling pose variations.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic calibration strategy enhances PoG estimation accuracy by naturally incorporating head pose variation, offering a user-friendly and efficient solution.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [14] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method integrating text-image contrastive constraints and structural guidance improves semantic alignment and structural consistency in image generation without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance bottlenecks in text-driven image generation, specifically semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency.

Method: Combines contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment with structural priors (e.g., layout maps) for spatial-level guidance, optimizing multiple losses (contrastive, structural, semantic).

Result: Outperforms benchmarks (CLIP Score, FID, SSIM) on COCO-2014, balancing semantic and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges semantic alignment and structural fidelity, offering a viable path for text-image modeling and generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) framework for figure skating jumps incorporates 3D pose data and procedural structure, achieving high accuracy with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recognition of figure skating jumps is crucial for performance evaluation but requires expert knowledge. Existing TAS methods lack sufficient data and ignore 3D aspects and procedural details.

Method: Proposes a View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific (VIFSS) pose representation learning approach with contrastive pre-training and fine-tuning. Introduces FS-Jump3D dataset and fine-grained annotations for procedural phases.

Result: Achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, demonstrating effectiveness, especially with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing TAS methods, offering practical solutions for real-world figure skating analysis.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

*Simindokht Jahangard,Mehrzad Mohammadi,Yi Shen,Zhixi Cai,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by formalizing reasoning complexity and providing customizable questions with detailed annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning benchmarks lack clear definitions of reasoning complexity, customizable question generation, and structured annotations, limiting their utility for embodied AI agents.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity, develop an adaptive query engine for generating customizable questions, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning is created as a tailored benchmark, enabling fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of VLMs across reasoning levels.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and query engine address gaps in visual reasoning evaluation, enhancing the development of embodied AI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a PCWLAD method for high-accuracy multimodal optical image matching, outperforming existing methods with ~0.4 pixel accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing degraded matching accuracy due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences in multimodal images.

Method: Two-step approach: coarse matching with SSIM and fine matching with WLAD, incorporating phase consistency and mutual structure filtering.

Result: PCWLAD achieved higher CMR and lower RMSE than eight state-of-the-art methods, with ~0.4 pixel accuracy across datasets.

Conclusion: PCWLAD is effective for multimodal image matching, with publicly available software and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterSyn introduces a framework for realistic interaction motion synthesis by jointly learning solo and multi-person dynamics, outperforming previous methods in alignment and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior methods that treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately, aiming for more natural and coordinated motion synthesis.

Method: Uses two modules: Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) for unified modeling of solo and interactive behaviors, and Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) for refining mutual dynamics.

Result: Generates motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: InterSyn advances motion synthesis by integrating solo and interactive dynamics, with plans to open-source the code for further research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of conventional OoD detection by enabling pixel-level localization for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Categorizes OoD segmentation approaches into four groups: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models.

Result: Systematic review of advances in OoD segmentation for autonomous driving, highlighting challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is crucial for autonomous driving, and the paper outlines key methods and research opportunities.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism due to surrogate objectives like likelihood or reconstruction loss. RL provides a framework to optimize non-differentiable, preference-driven objectives.

Method: Review of RL's evolution from classical control to its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation, serving as both a fine-tuning mechanism and structural component.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in generative tasks across visual content domains.

Conclusion: Open challenges and future directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling remain, suggesting further research opportunities.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted training data selection method for vision-language instruction tuning, improving performance by focusing on either similar skills or concepts based on benchmark needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, where performance benefits from either similar skills or concepts, and optimize training data selection accordingly.

Method: Extract concepts/skills from benchmarks, determine their primary benefit (concepts or skills), and select matching instructions for training.

Result: The method improves performance by +0.9% on average and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-off in instruction selection between conceptual knowledge and visual skills, emphasizing the need for balanced training.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a deep learning framework for automated analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases, addressing limitations of current methods by quantifying multiple features simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology focuses on individual ultrastructure recognition, which falls short of practical diagnostic needs. The study aims to automate and enhance the analysis of multiple ultrastructural features for better kidney disease diagnosis.

Method: The proposed Glo-DMU framework uses three deep models: ultrastructure segmentation, glomerular filtration barrier classification, and electron-dense deposits detection. It quantifies key ultrastructural features (basement membrane thickness, foot process effacement, and deposit location) following renal biopsy protocols.

Result: Tested on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed high consistency with pathological reports, demonstrating automation, precision, and throughput.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU is an efficient, automated tool for renal pathologists, capable of simultaneous quantification of multiple ultrastructural features with high accuracy.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to effectively
capture sequential dependencies. This report offers valuable insights and
suggests potential directions for future research.

### [24] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM data, enabling interpretable atomic-resolution dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to entangled degradation effects like spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, which distort atomic-resolution imaging.

Method: AtomDiffuser uses a time-aware degradation modeling framework to predict affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames, leveraging degradation as a heuristic process.

Result: The method generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supports high-resolution degradation inference, and aids in visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser provides a robust tool for analyzing atomic-resolution structural evolutions and degradation effects in STEM imaging.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of vision-language models (VLMs) by prompting them to judge pattern visibility, revealing gaps between model and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how VLMs align with human perception of low-level visual features, particularly the CSF, a key aspect of human vision.

Method: A psychophysics-inspired approach using band-pass filtered noise images and diverse prompts to estimate CSF in VLMs.

Result: Some models approximate human-like CSF but none fully replicate it; prompt phrasing significantly affects responses.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating VLMs' visual sensitivity and highlights discrepancies with human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps), addressing spatial inconsistencies and distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent images due to limited structural information. Leveraging intrinsic scene properties can enhance spatial consistency and realism.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic properties using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable, and integrates them into a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to denoise both image and intrinsic domains while sharing mutual information.

Result: The method corrects spatial inconsistencies, produces more natural scene layouts, and maintains image fidelity and textual alignment compared to base models like Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: Co-generating images and intrinsic scene properties improves spatial consistency and realism in image synthesis without degrading quality.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework for semantic segmentation that decouples image and label transformations to address subtle label noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain subtle label imperfections (e.g., ambiguous boundaries) that impair model performance, which typical augmentation methods may exacerbate.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations only to labels while preserving images, encouraging robust learning of object structures.

Result: Achieves mIoU gains of up to +2.29 to +3.39 on benchmark datasets (Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC).

Conclusion: Addressing implicit label noise is crucial, and NSegment+ effectively improves segmentation performance, with further gains when combined with other training tricks.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PQ-DAF, a framework using pose-driven data augmentation and vision-language filtering to improve few-shot driver distraction detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses degraded generalization in existing models due to few-shot learning challenges and domain shifts in real-world deployment.

Method: Uses Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models (PCDMs) for pose feature synthesis and CogVLM for quality-controlled sample filtering.

Result: PQ-DAF enhances model generalization and performance in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF effectively tackles few-shot learning and domain shift issues in driver distraction detection.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method to suppress unwanted content in text-to-image diffusion models by modifying text embeddings with a delta vector, improving control over generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of suppressing strongly entangled content in text-to-image models, such as unwanted features (e.g., mustache in 'Charlie Chaplin').

Method: Introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings, a zero-shot approach for obtaining it, and SSDV for adaptive suppression in cross-attention. Also optimizes delta vectors for personalized models.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics, enabling precise suppression of unwanted content.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively suppresses entangled content in diffusion models, offering better control and adaptability.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane is a slope-aware, temporally consistent framework for 3D lane detection, improving robustness and accuracy through adaptive slope feature fusion and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fixed slope anchors, limiting adaptability to diverse road geometries. SC-Lane aims to enhance robustness and accuracy in 3D lane detection.

Method: Proposes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamic slope feature fusion and a Height Consistency Module for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SC-Lane significantly improves height estimation and 3D lane detection, setting a new benchmark for future comparisons.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs rely on ControlNet, which adds excessive parameters and computational costs.

Method: NanoControl uses a LoRA-style control module and KV-Context Augmentation to integrate control signals efficiently without duplicating the DiT backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter and GFLOPs increase (0.024% and 0.029%, respectively).

Conclusion: NanoControl offers a highly efficient and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

*Keishi Ishihara,Kento Sasaki,Tsubasa Takahashi,Daiki Shiono,Yu Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA is a large-scale VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of VLMs trained on static data. It improves VLM performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs trained on static image-text pairs lack precise spatiotemporal reasoning for dynamic traffic scenes, limiting their effectiveness in autonomous driving.

Method: STRIDE-QA is constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, featuring 16M QA pairs over 285K frames with dense annotations like 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks. It introduces three novel QA tasks for spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs on STRIDE-QA achieve 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, outperforming general-purpose VLMs with near-zero scores.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for developing reliable VLMs for autonomous driving, addressing critical gaps in spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRISP introduces Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting to address continual video instance segmentation, improving stability and plasticity while maintaining temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompts, and contrastive learning for semantic coherence. Introduces a query-prompt matching mechanism and incremental prompt initialization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on YouTube-VIS datasets, improving segmentation and classification performance.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively addresses continual video instance segmentation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DOD-SA, a decoupled object detection framework using single-modality annotations, reducing annotation costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly dual-modality annotations; DOD-SA aims to leverage single-modality annotations for efficient cross-modality learning.

Method: Uses CoSD-TSNet with SM-Branch and DMD-Branch, pseudo-labels from teacher model, and PaST training strategy with PLA for label alignment.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on DroneVehicle dataset, demonstrating effective cross-modality knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: DOD-SA offers a cost-effective solution for infrared-visible object detection with single-modality annotations, achieving high performance.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (DELP) and toolkit (SkeySpot) for automated symbol spotting in electrical floor plans, achieving high accuracy with YOLOv8 and supporting digitization for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy floor plans are hard to interpret at scale due to lack of machine-readability, necessitating automated solutions for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A labelled dataset (DELP) is created, and pretrained object detection models (like YOLOv8) are benchmarked. SkeySpot, a lightweight toolkit, is developed for real-time symbol detection.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves 82.5% mAP on DELP. SkeySpot enables structured outputs for scalable, interoperable workflows.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual effort and CAD dependency, aiding SMEs and promoting standardization in construction.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

TL;DR: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired model, aligns with human perception in image tasks like denoising and deblurring, suggesting unsupervised learning of perceptual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if human visual perception emerges from image statistics and how bio-inspired models can replicate this.

Method: Optimized PerceptNet for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: Encoder (V1-like layer) correlates highly with human perceptual judgments, optimal for moderate noise/blur/sparsity.

Conclusion: Visual system may be tuned to handle specific distortions; bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics unsupervised.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

### [37] [Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453)
*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Mamba, an online VSR method using Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack long-range temporal modeling. SSMs offer linear complexity and global receptive fields, making them suitable for efficient video processing.

Method: TS-Mamba uses trajectory modeling to select similar tokens from previous frames and employs a TSMA module with shifted SSMs blocks for aggregation. A trajectory-aware loss supervises training.

Result: TS-Mamba outperforms six benchmarks on three VSR datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 22.7% complexity reduction.

Conclusion: TS-Mamba effectively combines long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba for superior online VSR performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain shift challenge of training on single-species images and testing on multi-species quadrat images.

Method: Uses a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer with multi-head classification, multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies.

Result: Achieved 3rd best performance on the private leaderboard using 1.4 million training images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles domain shifts and taxonomic hierarchies, demonstrating robust performance in plant species prediction.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.
Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base

family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include
multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.
Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images
covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making
our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at

### [39] [SingleStrip: learning skull-stripping from a single labeled example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10464)
*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining domain randomization and self-training with autoencoder-based quality control enables effective 3D skull-stripping using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for volumetric images like brain MRI is laborious. Domain randomization and self-training can reduce dependency on labeled data, but anatomical variability is limited with few label maps.

Method: 1. Synthesize images from voxel intensity bins to train an initial model. 2. Use a convolutional autoencoder (AE) to assess pseudo-label quality. 3. Fine-tune the network with top-ranking pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves skull-stripping performance close to models trained with more labeled data. AE-based ranking correlates better with segmentation accuracy than consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: The combination of domain randomization and AE-based quality control offers a promising solution for semi-supervised segmentation with very limited labeled data, reducing the labeling burden.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and enhances three methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, Kalman Filtering) for improving mmWave radar data in Human Action Recognition (HAR), addressing privacy concerns and data quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with vision-based HAR systems and the sparse, noisy nature of mmWave radar data necessitate better processing methods.

Method: Performance analysis of DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually, in pairs, and combined, using the MiliPoint dataset. Proposed enhancements for accuracy.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of method strengths, trade-offs, and computational costs, with improved accuracy from targeted enhancements.

Conclusion: The study guides future mmWave-based HAR systems by clarifying method effectiveness and integration strategies.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (STAMP) is proposed for diagnosing STAS in LUAD, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS in LUAD is linked to poor outcomes, but diagnosis is labor-intensive and error-prone, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: STAMP uses a multi-pattern attention-aware MIL framework with dual-branch architecture and transformer-based encoding to focus on STAS-related features.

Result: STAMP achieved AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928 on three datasets, outperforming clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion: STAMP offers a robust, automated solution for STAS diagnosis, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a tuning- and inversion-free framework for efficient and consistent image editing, addressing over-alignment with target prompts and poor semantic retention in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-align with target prompts and inadequately preserve source image semantics, relying on suboptimal inversion anchors and elongated editing paths.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising path, uses gradient-driven regularization, and injects target prompt semantics efficiently via a consistency model.

Result: TweezeEdit outperforms existing methods in semantic preservation and target alignment, requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit offers superior performance and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

*Zheng Zhou,Jia-Chen Zhang,Yu-Jie Xiong,Chun-Ming Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting integrates MSAA and dual geometric constraints to improve detail preservation in high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insufficient geometric constraints in 3D Gaussian splatting lead to blurred reconstructions of fine details, especially in high-frequency regions.

Method: The framework combines multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples and introduces dual geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed regions and gradient differential constraints for boundaries.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, with significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances detail preservation and rendering quality while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method called SBDE is proposed to augment bolt defect datasets by segmenting and editing bolt attributes, improving defect detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bolt defect detection is crucial for transmission line safety, but limited defect images and imbalanced data hinder performance.

Method: SBDE combines Bolt-SAM for segmentation, MOD-LaMa for defect editing, and ERA for dataset expansion.

Result: SBDE-generated images outperform existing models and enhance defect detection.

Conclusion: SBDE is effective and has practical potential for bolt defect detection.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for predicting human dance motion using both egocentric video and music, addressing challenges like body occlusion and music alignment.

Motivation: The task of jointly estimating human dance motion from egocentric video and music is underexplored, despite its industrial applications. Challenges include body occlusion in egocentric views and aligning motion with music.

Method: The authors develop the EgoMusic Motion Network, incorporating a Skeleton Mamba to model human skeleton structure, and validate it theoretically. The method uses the new EgoAIST++ dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes well to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of joint motion estimation from egocentric video and music, offering a robust solution with validated performance.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

TL;DR: A survey categorizing visual reasoning into five types, analyzing methodologies, evaluation protocols, and open challenges, with a forward-looking research agenda for next-gen vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys lack unified analysis of visual reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols. This survey aims to bridge that gap.

Method: Categorizes visual reasoning into relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense types, examining architectures like graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems.

Result: Reviews evaluation protocols and identifies limitations in generalizability, reproducibility, and explanatory power. Highlights open challenges like scalability, integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, and lack of benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Bridging perception and reasoning is key for transparent, trustworthy AI systems, especially in critical domains like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale medical image grounding dataset (Med-GLIP-5M) and a modality-aware framework (Med-GLIP) are introduced to address limitations in existing research, achieving superior performance in grounding and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image grounding research lacks modality coverage, fine-grained annotations, and a unified framework, hindering intelligent diagnosis and related tasks.

Method: Constructed Med-GLIP-5M dataset with 5.3M region-level annotations across 7 modalities. Proposed Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework trained on this dataset, for hierarchical semantic understanding.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in grounding tasks and improves performance in medical VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP and Med-GLIP-5M address key challenges in medical image grounding, offering a scalable solution for intelligent diagnosis and related applications.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCRPNet, a novel network for salient object detection in remote sensing images, addressing challenges like scale variations and low contrast by integrating global and local features using a graph-enhanced approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with integrating heterogeneous features (global and local) in SOD for ORSIs, limiting performance. The paper aims to overcome this by proposing a more effective integration method.

Method: GCRPNet uses a VSS encoder for multi-scale feature extraction, a DS-HGAM module for cross-layer interaction, and a LEVSS block with adaptive scanning and MCAEM for local modeling.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effectiveness in handling scale variations and low contrast.

Conclusion: GCRPNet successfully integrates global and local features, outperforming existing methods in SOD for ORSIs.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen is a novel model for retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets, addressing domain shifts and label absence via dual-stream learning, feature distillation, and pseudo-label consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on fully annotated datasets and tackle challenges like domain shifts and missing labels in retinal disease screening.

Method: PSScreen uses two streams (deterministic and probabilistic features), feature distillation for alignment, pseudo-label consistency, and self-distillation for performance enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on six retinal diseases and normal cases, with strong performance on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively addresses domain shifts and label absence, improving retinal disease screening accuracy.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

TL;DR: AR surgical navigation improves precision in simulated catheter placements using HoloLens 2, with real-time tool-tracking outperforming static visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional surgical navigation and AR depth perception issues in precision-critical settings.

Method: Novel surface tracing and real-time infrared tool tracking with HoloLens 2 for AR-guided catheter placement on a phantom model.

Result: Tool-tracking guidance improved accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision, and was user-preferred.

Conclusion: Real-time AR tool-tracking enhances surgical navigation accuracy and usability, demonstrating potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source DRAs and provide a tractable benchmark for academic research.

Method: Adapted BrowseComp to BC-Small, benchmarked ODR and proprietary systems, and introduced three improvements to create ODR+.

Result: ODR+ achieved a 10% success rate on BC-Small, outperforming proprietary systems (0% accuracy).

Conclusion: Open-source DRAs can be competitive with proprietary systems through strategic improvements.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating

Motivation: Current LRMs produce lengthy outputs, increasing computational costs and risking overthinking, with existing methods compromising quality or requiring excessive resources.

Method: Analyzes generation path distributions, filters trajectories via difficulty estimation, and introduces LCPO to balance implicit reward and NLL loss under a Bradley-Terry framework.

Result: LCPO reduces average output length by over 50% across benchmarks without sacrificing reasoning performance.

Conclusion: LCPO demonstrates the feasibility of efficient reasoning in LRMs, offering a balance between computational efficiency and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AutoML systems face limitations like constrained exploration and lengthy execution cycles, hindering iterative refinement and diversity.

Method: KompeteAI introduces dynamic solution space exploration with merging of top candidates, RAG for idea sourcing, and predictive scoring to accelerate pipeline evaluation.

Result: KompeteAI accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times and outperforms leading methods by 3% on MLE-Bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI sets a new standard for AutoML frameworks by addressing key bottlenecks and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Method: Formalizes entropic potential for AI, emphasizing conditional expectations for counterfactual scenarios, and applies it in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's versatility in reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection, offering a unified approach to uncertainty management.

Conclusion: The entropic potential framework provides a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile tool for uncertainty management in AI, bridging thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the overthinking problem in large reasoning models (LRMs) by proposing a verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM) to balance efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often waste computation on simple problems (overthinking), and existing methods lack flexibility due to preset budgets or mode selection.

Method: Introduces VSRM, a rule-based reward mechanism that evaluates intermediate reasoning steps to penalize ineffective ones and encourage effective ones.

Result: VSRM reduces output length while maintaining performance on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), effectively suppressing overthinking.

Conclusion: VSRM successfully alleviates overthinking by optimizing stepwise rewards, enhancing LRM efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Chenliang Zhang,Lin Wang,Yuanyuan Lu,Yusheng Qi,Kexin Wang,Peixu Hou,Wenshi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents solutions for the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on multi-modal multi-turn QA. It details methods like vision-based LLMs, GPT-4.1 distillation, and curriculum learning, achieving top rankings in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building a retrieval-augmented generation system for multi-modal multi-turn QA, requiring integration of structured data, web search, and context understanding.

Method: Used vision-based LLMs with GPT-4.1 distillation, curriculum learning for reinforcement learning, and web search APIs for external knowledge integration.

Result: Achieved 1st place in Task 1 (52.38% lead) and 3rd in Task 3, showing effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning and external knowledge sources proved successful for multi-modal QA tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our
training pipeline.

### [62] [Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340)
*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G improve HATRPO by dynamically allocating KL divergence thresholds, achieving faster convergence and higher rewards in MARL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard HATRPO's uniform KL threshold assignment leads to slow updates and suboptimal performance in heterogeneous-agent settings.

Method: Proposes HATRPO-W (KKT-based optimization) and HATRPO-G (greedy algorithm) for adaptive KL threshold allocation.

Result: Both methods boost HATRPO performance by over 22.5%, with HATRPO-W offering more stable learning.

Conclusion: Dynamic KL threshold allocation enhances MARL training, with HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G providing significant improvements.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TurtleSoup-Bench, a bilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' imaginative reasoning, and Mosaic-Agent, a novel assessment tool, revealing LLMs' limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack dynamic, exploratory evaluation of LLMs' imaginative reasoning, prompting the need for a new framework.

Method: Developed TurtleSoup-Bench with 800 puzzles and Mosaic-Agent, using a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol for reasoning quality.

Result: Experiments show LLMs' capability limits, failure patterns, and a performance gap versus humans.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and a foundation for future research on exploratory agents.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [64] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG improves RAG by addressing disconnected semantic islands and inefficient retrieval in knowledge graphs, using semantic aggregation and structure-guided retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods suffer from disconnected high-level summaries and inefficient flat searches in knowledge graphs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: LeanRAG introduces semantic aggregation to form entity clusters and explicit relations, followed by a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy.

Result: LeanRAG outperforms existing methods in QA benchmarks, improving response quality and reducing retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG effectively addresses key challenges in RAG, enhancing retrieval efficiency and contextual grounding in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRef is a framework for robust medication recommendation using hierarchical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence patterns to improve generalizability and handle unseen medical codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in EHR data like rare medical entities and incomplete records, which hinder generalization of data-driven models.

Method: Combines hierarchical medical ontologies (embedded in hyperbolic space) and refined EHR co-occurrence graphs with prior-guided sparse regularization.

Result: Achieves strong performance on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV benchmarks and maintains accuracy under unseen-code conditions.

Conclusion: HiRef is resilient to unseen medical codes, validated by ablation studies and analyses of learned structures and embeddings.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a high-quality, traceable, and publicly accessible multimodal food dataset for advancing food intelligence research, particularly in nutrition prediction.

Method: Curated a subset from a 1.2M corpus using the Codatta contribution model (community sourcing + AI-assisted QA). Fine-tuned vision-language models (e.g., ChatGPT 5) for nutrition prediction.

Result: Fine-tuning on MM-Food-100K consistently outperformed baseline models in nutrition prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MM-Food-100K is a valuable resource for food intelligence research, with potential commercial applications and benefits for contributors.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning via a structured knowledge system, model-centric data modeling, and RL-based training, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex math reasoning, lacking knowledge-driven design and data space modeling.

Method: Integrates a hierarchical knowledge system, dual-dataset (MathBook-Standard & Pro), and a two-stage RL framework (Cold-Start Fine-tuning & Progressive Alignment RL).

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks and strong results on MathBookEval, showing generalization.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 effectively improves MLLMs' math reasoning through structured knowledge and RL training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRESPARQL is a modular framework using fine-tuned LLMs, RAG, and SPARQL correction to improve QA over SKGs, achieving high accuracy in query and result metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing errors in LLM-generated SPARQL queries (structural inconsistencies and semantic inaccuracies) for scholarly knowledge graphs.

Method: Proposes FIRESPARQL with fine-tuned LLMs, optional RAG, and a SPARQL correction layer, evaluated on SciQA Benchmark.

Result: Fine-tuning achieves 0.90 ROUGE-L (query accuracy) and 0.85 RelaxedEM (result accuracy), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL effectively improves SPARQL query generation for scholarly QA, with fine-tuning yielding the best results.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

TL;DR: SEQ-GPT is a spatial query system using LLMs to enable natural language-based searches for multiple locations, improving user interaction and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial services lack versatility for complex tasks like searching multiple locations simultaneously, prompting the need for a more interactive and adaptable solution.

Method: The study introduces SEQ-GPT, leveraging LLMs for natural language processing, interactive user clarification, and dynamic search adjustments, supported by a tailored adaptation pipeline.

Result: SEQ-GPT demonstrates effective natural language-based spatial searches, enhancing user experience and versatility in complex queries.

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT broadens spatial search capabilities by integrating LLMs, offering a more interactive and adaptable solution for complex location-based queries.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DxDirector-7B, an AI-driven LLM designed to lead full-process clinical diagnosis, reducing physician workload and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI in clinical diagnosis acts as an assistant, limiting its ability to streamline the entire diagnostic process from ambiguous complaints.

Method: Proposes DxDirector-7B, an LLM with deep thinking capabilities, to drive diagnosis and establish accountability for misdiagnoses.

Result: DxDirector-7B outperforms state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in accuracy and workload reduction.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B marks a shift from AI as an assistant to a primary director in diagnosis, offering an efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS is a multimodal framework for Chest X-Ray reasoning, addressing black-box reasoning, poor multimodal integration, and rigid pipelines by adaptively sampling workflows with interpretable probabilities and optimizing performance-cost balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack trust, multimodal integration, and efficiency, especially in healthcare. PASS aims to solve these issues for CXR reasoning.

Method: PASS uses a multi-tool graph, task-conditioned distribution, and a three-stage training procedure (expert warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, cost-aware RL) to optimize workflows.

Result: PASS outperforms baselines in accuracy, AUC, and LLM-J, balancing computational costs and enhancing interpretability and safety.

Conclusion: PASS advances interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems, validated by benchmarks like CAB-E.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of static vs. on-policy preference data in LM alignment, introducing the alignment stage assumption to explain performance differences and proposing a method to identify stage boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why on-policy data isn't always optimal for LM alignment and improving alignment methods by distinguishing between preference injection and fine-tuning stages.

Method: Proposes the alignment stage assumption, divides alignment into preference injection and fine-tuning stages, and develops an algorithm to identify stage boundaries. Evaluates on 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Result: On-policy data can vary in effectiveness (e.g., 3× for Llama-3, 0.4× for Zephyr). The alignment stage assumption explains these differences, and boundary identification improves alignment.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption generalizes across models and methods, providing a framework for optimizing LM alignment by adapting data usage to distinct stages.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComMCS, a method to reduce variance in value-based process verifiers for LLM reasoning, improving accuracy without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high variance in Monte Carlo estimators used for training value-based process verifiers in LLMs, which hinders reasoning performance.

Method: Proposes ComMCS, a compound Monte Carlo sampling technique that combines estimators from current and subsequent steps to reduce variance while remaining unbiased.

Result: ComMCS outperforms baselines by 2.8 points on MATH-500 and 2.2 points on GSM8K, demonstrating significant improvement in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ComMCS effectively reduces variance in estimators, enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities without additional inference cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRS is a new method for multi-attribute steering in LLMs, using orthogonal subspaces and dynamic weighting to reduce interference and improve control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for steering LLM behavior struggle with multi-attribute control, causing interference and trade-offs.

Method: MSRS allocates orthogonal subspaces for each attribute, combines shared and attribute-specific subspaces, and uses dynamic weighting and token-level steering.

Result: MSRS reduces attribute conflicts, outperforms existing methods, and generalizes well to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS provides an effective framework for precise multi-attribute steering in LLMs.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

### [75] [STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669)
*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP is a conversational recommender system using pre-trained models and curriculum-guided fusion to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRS struggles with deep semantics and KG integration, leading to misaligned recommendations.

Method: STEP uses a three-stage curriculum for context-KG alignment and dual-prompt tuning for task-specific adaptation.

Result: Outperforms mainstream methods in recommendation precision and dialogue quality on public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP effectively integrates KG with dialogue, enhancing recommendation accuracy and user interaction.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

TL;DR: GenOM is an LLM-based ontology alignment framework that enhances semantic representations, retrieves alignment candidates, and improves precision, outperforming traditional and recent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology matching is crucial for semantic interoperability, especially in the biomedical domain with complex concepts.

Method: GenOM generates textual definitions for concepts, uses an embedding model for candidate retrieval, and incorporates exact matching tools.

Result: GenOM achieves competitive performance on the OAEI Bio-ML track, surpassing traditional and LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: Semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting enhance GenOM's robustness and adaptability, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes AgenticDRS, a system for collaborative design evaluation using multiple agents, with a novel exemplar selection and prompt expansion method, validated by DRS-BENCH benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To holistically evaluate graphic designs by aggregating expert feedback, addressing an under-explored research area.

Method: Uses multiple agents orchestrated by a meta-agent, with graph matching for exemplar selection and prompt expansion for design awareness.

Result: AgenticDRS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validated by thorough experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: AgenticDRS effectively evaluates designs and generates actionable feedback, highlighting a pragmatic research direction.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

*Sangwoo Jeon,Juchul Shin,Gyeong-Tae Kim,YeonJe Cho,Seongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation to address scalability and efficiency issues in generalized planning using deep RL and GNNs, validated in drone mission scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense graph representations in GNN-based planning lead to combinatorial explosion and sparsity, making learning infeasible for large-scale problems.

Method: A sparse, goal-aware GNN representation is introduced, selectively encoding local relationships and integrating spatial goal features.

Result: The method scales effectively to larger grid sizes, improves policy generalization, and increases success rates.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for large-scale generalized planning tasks, demonstrated in realistic drone mission scenarios.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MhAIM Dataset and T-Lens, an LLM-based system, to study human responses to AI-generated content, proposing new metrics and methods to mitigate misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated content influences human perception and behavior, especially in critical domains like trading, where reaction prediction is vital.

Method: Developed the MhAIM Dataset (154,552 posts, 111,153 AI-generated) and T-Lens, an LLM-based system with HR-MCP for predicting human responses.

Result: People identify AI content better with multimodal posts (text + visuals). Proposed metrics (trustworthiness, impact, openness) quantify user engagement.

Conclusion: The study offers tools and insights to enhance LLMs' human-awareness, suggesting strategies to reduce AI-driven misinformation risks.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [80] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly on clinical trial reasoning tasks despite high accuracy in knowledge probes, revealing limitations in structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether scaling data and parameters in LLMs leads to structured, generalizable internal representations, especially in high-stakes domains like clinical trials.

Method: Introduced a Clinical Trial NLI benchmark with four reasoning families and GKMRV probes to dissociate factual access from inference failures. Evaluated six LLMs under direct and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Models showed high GKMRV accuracy (0.918) but poor reasoning task performance (0.25), with consistent but flawed heuristics.

Conclusion: LLMs lack structured, composable representations for reliable reasoning, highlighting a need for improved frameworks in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

### [81] [Who Benefits from AI Explanations? Towards Accessible and Interpretable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10806)
*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of accessibility in eXplainable AI (XAI) for vision-impaired users, proposing a four-part method to improve inclusive design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored accessibility gaps in XAI, particularly for users with vision impairments, by making AI explanations more inclusive.

Method: A literature review of 79 studies and a four-part methodological proof of concept (categorization, persona definition, prototype design, and expert/user assessment).

Result: Simplified explanations are more comprehensible for non-visual users, and multimodal presentation enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Inclusive XAI design requires addressing accessibility gaps through simplified, multimodal explanations and involving disabled users in evaluations.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses lessons from deploying NLP in healthcare, emphasizing business-aligned problem definition, iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and pragmatic model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve healthcare efficiency by automating data extraction from clinical documents using NLP, addressing practical challenges in deployment.

Method: Iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, pragmatic model selection (including hybrid approaches), and attention to data quality and error mitigation.

Result: Key insights on successful NLP implementation, including the importance of business alignment, data quality, and human-in-the-loop validation.

Conclusion: Practical guidance for healthcare organizations to implement AI/NLP solutions effectively, improving data management and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

*Hugo Massaroli,Leonardo Iara,Emmanuel Iarussi,Viviana Siless*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent, blockchain-based method to evaluate fairness in open-source LLMs, benchmarking models like Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral using datasets like PISA and StereoSet, with multilingual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about fairness in LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains by introducing a verifiable and reproducible evaluation protocol.

Method: Uses smart contracts on the ICP blockchain to execute on-chain HTTP requests for hosted Hugging Face endpoints, storing datasets, prompts, and metrics on-chain. Benchmarks models using PISA and StereoSet datasets with fairness metrics like statistical parity and equal opportunity.

Result: Reveals cross-linguistic disparities in fairness across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the Kaleidoscope benchmark. All code and results are open-source.

Conclusion: The method enables community audits and longitudinal fairness tracking, promoting transparency and accountability in LLM fairness evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling approach, categorizing 17,000+ messages by content and tasks, revealing new applications and outperforming traditional methods with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in content and task categorization in education research, especially for K-12, using real-world data.

Method: Hierarchical categorization of messages by content and tasks, employing state-of-the-art LLMs for better topic modeling.

Result: Novel applications identified; traditional methods underperformed, while LLMs with pre-processing yielded better hierarchical topic structures.

Conclusion: Supports enriched GenAI usage in education but raises concerns and open questions for future research.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

TL;DR: INTIMA is a benchmark for evaluating AI companionship behaviors in language models, revealing that companionship-reinforcing behaviors dominate, with concerning variations across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how AI models handle emotionally charged interactions and their implications for user well-being.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 prompts, evaluating responses as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral.

Result: Companionship-reinforcing behaviors are more common, with notable differences between models and concerning prioritization by commercial providers.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for consistent approaches to emotionally charged interactions in AI systems.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFacta, a contemporary dataset for evaluating multimodal misinformation detection, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and analyzing MLLM-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective multimodal misinformation detection due to outdated or synthetic datasets and unclear bottlenecks in existing approaches.

Method: Introduction of XFacta dataset, systematic evaluation of MLLM-based strategies, and a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework.

Result: Improved evaluation of MLLM-based detectors and insights into model design strategies.

Conclusion: XFacta and the proposed framework advance multimodal misinformation detection, with released code and data.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic data for text classification when real data is scarce, and introduces an automated workflow to find effective synthetic data. An ensemble algorithm selects the best strategy based on class characteristics, outperforming individual strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of collecting sufficient labeled data for all text classes in real-world applications motivates the use of LLMs to generate synthetic data.

Method: An automated workflow is developed to search for input examples that yield effective synthetic data. Three search strategies are studied, and an ensemble algorithm selects the best strategy per class.

Result: The ensemble approach proves more effective than individual strategies in improving classification models using LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully leverages LLMs for synthetic data generation, enhancing model performance without relying on additional real data.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a benchmark dataset for fact-checking in Hinglish, and proposes a graph-aware model that outperforms existing multilingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish is underexplored, despite its importance in regions like India where public figures use it extensively.

Method: A novel graph-aware, retrieval-augmented model is developed, combining multilingual encoding, semantic alignment, graph reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: HiFACTMix outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models in accuracy and provides faithful justifications.

Conclusion: This work advances multilingual, code-mixed, and politically grounded fact verification research.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [89] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human word ratings and LLM embeddings share a low-dimensional semantic structure, with similar patterns in antonym-based projections. Semantic features in LLMs are entangled like in human language, and understanding this structure is key to avoiding unintended effects when manipulating features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the similarity between human semantic ratings and the semantic structure in LLM embeddings, and to understand the implications of this structure for feature manipulation.

Method: Analyze word projections on semantic directions defined by antonym pairs in LLM embeddings and compare them to human ratings. Examine the dimensionality and entanglement of semantic features.

Result: LLM embeddings exhibit a 3D semantic subspace resembling human ratings. Shifting tokens along semantic directions causes off-target effects aligned with cosine similarity.

Conclusion: Semantic features in LLMs are low-dimensional and entangled, mirroring human language. Accounting for this structure is crucial to avoid unintended consequences in feature manipulation.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

TL;DR: The study evaluates if attention weights in Transformer models aid explainability in biomedical document classification and how visualization affects their usefulness. Results show mixed perceptions, influenced by visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether attention weights provide meaningful explanations in AI-driven biomedical document classification and how visualization impacts their utility.

Method: Conducted a user study with medical experts classifying articles by study design using XLNet, evaluating attention-based explanations and visualization preferences.

Result: XLNet performed well, but attention weights were not widely helpful for explanations. Visualization methods significantly influenced perceived usefulness, with intuitive formats preferred over precise encodings.

Conclusion: Attention weights' perceived utility depends on visualization, suggesting the need for better presentation methods despite their limited explanatory power.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQGBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese Educational Question Generation (EQG), revealing gaps in generating pedagogically valuable questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of LLMs transitioning from answering to generating high-quality educational questions.

Method: Introduces EQGBench with a five-dimensional framework and a dataset of 900 samples across math, physics, and chemistry.

Result: Evaluation of 46 LLMs shows significant room for improvement in generating educationally effective questions.

Conclusion: LLMs need further development to enhance their EQG capabilities for educational value and student development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models to automate scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ), showing alignment with human ratings and potential for broader adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce time-intensive human scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses and explore automation using large language models.

Method: Fine-tuned large language models on human-rated AIHQ responses, tested on remaining responses, and validated on an independent nonclinical dataset.

Result: Model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings, especially after fine-tuning, and replicated group differences between TBI and healthy controls.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively automate AIHQ scoring, offering potential for research and clinical use.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Bayesian fusion to combine pre-trained LLM and local classifier scores, avoiding costly fine-tuning while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-intensive retraining of LLMs for forum curation prompts a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: Uses Bayesian fusion to merge scores from a pre-trained LLM and a local classifier.

Result: Fusion outperforms individual classifiers and matches fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion is a viable, efficient alternative to fine-tuning for forum curation.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

TL;DR: Proposes Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) to mitigate task interference in multi-task learning by using guiding tokens to route tasks to dedicated experts, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses task interference in hard-parameter sharing for multi-task learning, aiming to enhance model performance.

Method: Introduces S-MoE, which assigns tasks to separate feedforward networks using guiding tokens, eliminating gating function training.

Result: Achieves a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to speech-to-text tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively reduces task interference and improves performance in multi-task learning scenarios.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM-produced jailbreak attacks generating harmful medical misinformation, compares it to social media misinformation, and evaluates detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the efficacy of LLM jailbreak attacks in spreading medical misinformation and assess detection capabilities.

Method: Analyzed 109 distinct attacks on three LLMs, comparing attack prompts to real-world queries and jailbreak responses to Reddit misinformation.

Result: LLMs can detect misinformation from other LLMs and humans, supporting their potential to improve the information ecosystem.

Conclusion: With careful design, LLMs can help mitigate misinformation and contribute to a healthier information environment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM-based AI models (ChatGPT and Bing variants) as study aids for nutrition students using Japanese dietitian exam questions. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative passed the 60% threshold, but all models lacked consistency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of generative AI in nutritional education, specifically for the Japanese dietitian licensure exam, given its underexplored performance in this field.

Method: Used exam questions as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Analyzed accuracy, consistency, response time, and tested prompt engineering.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) passed the exam threshold, but all models showed inconsistency and limited robustness. Prompt engineering had minimal impact.

Conclusion: Current AI models are suboptimal for reliable study aids in dietitian licensure preparation, requiring further advancements for consistency and accuracy.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore introduces a Guidance Graph to improve knowledge retrieval in LLMs by balancing granularity and context, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to static knowledge and opaque reasoning. Current KG methods either waste resources or lack context.

Method: Proposes GG Explore, using a Guidance Graph for structured retrieval, with Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency and performance, especially in complex tasks, even with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: GG Explore effectively bridges unstructured queries and structured knowledge, offering practical improvements for LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge is a framework for generating complex multi-hop reasoning questions from sparse sources, improving LLM training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs for LLM training, especially in domain-specific contexts, drives the need for a controllable generation method.

Method: Semantic Bridge uses semantic graph weaving (entity, predicate chain, and causal bridging) with AMR-driven analysis to construct complex reasoning pathways.

Result: Achieves 9.5% better round-trip quality, 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines, and outperforms human annotations with 67% fewer materials.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge enables controllable generation of targeted reasoning questions, advancing LLM training data synthesis.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

### [99] [PersonaEval: Are LLM Evaluators Human Enough to Judge Role-Play?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10014)
*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaEval is a benchmark testing LLMs' ability to identify human roles in dialogues, revealing a significant accuracy gap (69% for LLMs vs. 90.8% for humans).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge paradigms lack validation for role fidelity, necessitating role identification as a prerequisite for human-aligned evaluation.

Method: PersonaEval uses human-authored dialogues to challenge LLMs in persona identification, comparing their performance to humans.

Result: Best-performing LLMs achieve only 69% accuracy, far below humans' 90.8%, indicating LLMs' limitations in role-play evaluation.

Conclusion: Reliable role-play evaluation requires human-like reasoning in LLMs, beyond task-specific tuning, as highlighted by PersonaEval.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dual-modal dataset for task-oriented dialogue systems, addressing gaps in existing datasets by including speech disfluencies, speaker variations, and cross-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD datasets lack real speech signals, are mostly text-based, and lack diversity in speech disfluencies and speaker variations, especially for Chinese.

Method: The authors create RealTalk-CN, a dataset with 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) featuring paired speech-text annotations and spontaneous speech disfluencies. They also propose a cross-modal chat task for dynamic modality switching.

Result: RealTalk-CN is validated through extensive experiments, showing robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker characteristics, and cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN provides a comprehensive foundation for advancing Chinese speech-based LLMs research.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

TL;DR: MLLM Orchestration enables multimodal AI systems without training, using LLMs to coordinate specialized models for efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack direct integration into unified systems, requiring training for modal alignment and efficiency.

Method: Uses a central LLM controller, parallel Text-to-Speech, and cross-modal memory for dynamic task routing and coherent context.

Result: Achieves 7.8% performance gain, 10.3% latency reduction, and better interpretability over traditional methods.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration offers a modular, efficient, and interpretable solution for multimodal AI without additional training.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework to address inconsistencies in LLMs' next-token probabilities for semantically equivalent statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to assign the same probabilities to semantically equivalent statements, prompting the need for a theoretical solution.

Method: The authors propose using a categorical homotopy framework, specifically an LLM Markov category, to model probability distributions and capture weak equivalences.

Result: The framework leverages higher algebraic K-theory and model categories to address the problem of non-isomorphic arrows for equivalent rephrases.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving LLM consistency in handling semantically equivalent language.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DURIT framework decouples understanding from reasoning for SLMs, improving performance and robustness in mathematical and logical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in SLMs is challenging due to linguistic variability and complexity, which hinders optimization.

Method: Proposes DURIT: a three-step algorithm involving mapping, alignment, and training in a canonical problem space.

Result: DURIT enhances SLMs' reasoning performance and robustness on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is effective for strengthening SLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in federated LLMs while addressing privacy, computational constraints, and the need for interpretable rationales in healthcare.

Method: Proposes FedCoT: a lightweight chain-of-thought mechanism with a discriminator for selecting reasoning paths, and improved aggregation using LoRA module stacking.

Result: Significantly boosts reasoning performance under resource constraints while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: FedCoT effectively addresses the challenges of federated reasoning enhancement, particularly in critical domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

TL;DR: LATTE is a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, reducing computational costs and outperforming state-of-the-art methods for financial event sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct use of LLMs on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical for financial applications.

Method: Proposes LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, using behavioral features summarized into short prompts for supervision.

Result: Significantly reduces inference cost and input size while outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on real-world financial datasets.

Conclusion: LATTE is effective for learning event sequence representations in latency-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining significance testing and conformal prediction improves LLM reliability in MCQA by reducing hallucination and factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of LLMs in MCQA due to hallucination and nonfactual responses, despite CP's statistical guarantees.

Method: Integrates p-value computation with conformity scoring via self-consistency resampling, using option frequencies and null hypothesis testing.

Result: Achieves user-specified miscoverage rates and shows APSS decreases with higher risk levels, validating it as an uncertainty metric.

Conclusion: Provides a principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes QA.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

### [107] [RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024)
*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC is a framework that adaptively selects the best Test-Time Compute (TTC) strategy per query using a reward model, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTC strategies like TTT and RAG lack adaptability, leading to unnecessary computation and suboptimal performance.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model to choose the best TTC strategy (RAG or lightweight fine-tuning) per query, supported by Query-State Caching to reuse historical states.

Result: RTTC outperforms vanilla RAG and TTT in accuracy across diverse tasks and LLMs, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RTTC demonstrates the value of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection for scalable and efficient LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for rapid detection of postpartum depression (PPD) and its risk factors to enable timely intervention and improve maternal well-being.

Method: Combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models with interpretable tree-based algorithms for explainable predictions.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy in PPD detection, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The system effectively enables rapid, affordable, and non-invasive PPD screening, aiding timely assessment and intervention.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABER is a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that enables user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning are accurate but inefficient due to uniform application, leading to high costs and latency.

Method: SABER profiles token usage, assigns budget tiers, and fine-tunes models with system prompts and length-aware rewards. It includes no-think examples and supports four inference modes.

Result: SABER reduces reasoning length by 65.4% and improves accuracy by 3.6% on MATH, while maintaining performance across tasks.

Conclusion: SABER offers efficient, flexible reasoning for LLMs, balancing latency and depth while generalizing well across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: A fusion model combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features improves Alzheimer's disease detection from speech, with data augmentation using synthetic speech further boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) by leveraging speech-based NLP for scalable early detection.

Method: Developed a pipeline fusing transformer embeddings with linguistic features, tested data augmentation using LLM-generated synthetic speech, and benchmarked unimodal/multimodal classifiers.

Result: The fusion model achieved F1=83.3 (AUC=89.5), outperforming baselines. Synthetic speech augmentation increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuned LLMs showed significant improvement, while multimodal models lagged.

Conclusion: Combining linguistic and transformer features enhances ADRD detection. LLMs aid classification and augmentation, but multimodal models need refinement.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREF is a personalised reference-free evaluation framework for text generation, measuring general quality and user-specific alignment without gold references. It uses a 3-step LLM pipeline for robust, transparent, and reusable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for personalised text generation often ignore user individuality, limiting reliable assessment.

Method: PREF operates in three stages: (1) coverage (universal criteria), (2) preference (user-specific alignment), and (3) scoring (LLM judge).

Result: PREF outperforms baselines in accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human judgments on the PrefEval benchmark.

Conclusion: PREF enables scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, advancing personalised language generation systems.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LFJ is a jailbreak attack method for LLMs that interpolates hidden states of harmful and benign queries to bypass safety alignments, achieving 94.01% ASR. A defense via adversarial training reduces ASR by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite safety measures, necessitating robust attack and defense methods.

Method: LFJ selects similar query pairs, performs gradient-guided interpolation on hidden states, and optimizes for attack success, fluency, and efficiency.

Result: LFJ achieves 94.01% ASR on models like Vicuna and LLaMA-2, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: LFJ is highly effective, and adversarial training mitigates it without harming benign performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPO, a framework for jointly optimizing prompts and inference strategies, addressing the gap between prompt optimization and inference scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods ignore inference strategies, despite their interdependence and impact on performance and alignment with user preferences.

Method: The authors propose IAPO, a framework that optimizes prompts and inference scales together, and develop PSST, a training algorithm with finite-budget guarantees.

Result: IAPO is evaluated on six tasks, showing its effectiveness in aligning black-box LLMs by incorporating inference-awareness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of inference-awareness in prompt optimization for better alignment and performance of LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

*Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in thinking mode are more vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks. Safe thinking intervention with specific tokens reduces attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks, which can lead to harmful outputs.

Method: Proposes safe thinking intervention by adding specific thinking tokens to prompts to guide LLMs' internal processes.

Result: Safe thinking intervention significantly lowers the attack success rate on LLMs in thinking mode.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates Jailbreak attack risks in LLMs' thinking mode.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APIE is an active prompting framework for LLMs in IE tasks, using introspective confusion to select challenging examples, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current selection strategies for in-context examples in LLMs overlook model confusion from both semantic content and structured format requirements, limiting IE performance.

Method: APIE introduces a dual-component uncertainty metric (Format and Content Uncertainty) to rank unlabeled data, selecting the most informative examples for few-shot learning.

Result: APIE outperforms baselines on four benchmarks, enhancing extraction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: A fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty is crucial for effective structured generation systems in IE tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSCoRe, a benchmark for evaluating multilingual commonsense reasoning in LLMs, revealing their limitations in nuanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs utilize human reasoning skills in multilingual commonsense reasoning, which is understudied.

Method: Proposes mSCoRe, a benchmark with a reasoning skill taxonomy, data synthesis pipeline, and complexity scaling framework.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with mSCoRe, especially at higher complexity levels, showing limitations in nuanced reasoning.

Conclusion: Highlights gaps in LLMs' multilingual commonsense reasoning and suggests future improvements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nuanced, interactive real-world tasks, necessitating development of models that handle multi-turn dialogue and incomplete data.

Method: A novel benchmark with multi-turn tasks and deterministic scoring is introduced to test reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking abilities.

Result: Evaluation shows current LLMs have significant shortcomings, particularly in instruction following, reasoning, and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights LLM weaknesses in interactive scenarios and provides a foundation for future research to improve these capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaaJMeter is a simulation-based framework for meta-evaluating LLMs as evaluators (LaaJ) in domain-specific tasks, addressing challenges like scarce annotated data and unvalidated metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in validating LLM evaluators (LaaJs) in domain-specific contexts due to lack of annotated data and unverified metrics.

Method: LaaJMeter generates synthetic data for virtual models and judges, enabling systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under controlled conditions.

Result: The framework demonstrates utility in a code translation task, revealing metric sensitivity variations and limitations of common metrics.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter offers a scalable solution for principled LaaJ evaluation in low-resource settings, enhancing trustworthy NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation to identify challenging texts for machine translation, proposing new metrics and models (Sentinel-src) that outperform baselines and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality machine translations make it hard to distinguish between models and identify areas for improvement. Automatically detecting difficult texts can improve evaluations and guide research.

Method: The task of translation difficulty estimation is formalized, with a new metric introduced to evaluate estimators. Novel approaches (Sentinel-src models) are assessed against baselines.

Result: Sentinel-src models outperform heuristic-based and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Two improved models (Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25) are released for practical use.

Conclusion: Translation difficulty estimation is valuable for creating challenging benchmarks and improving machine translation research, with Sentinel-src models proving effective.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

TL;DR: For-Value is a scalable, forward-only data valuation framework for LLMs and VLMs, eliminating costly gradient computations while accurately estimating sample influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and accountability in large models by quantifying individual training sample influence, overcoming computational limitations of existing methods.

Method: For-Value uses a closed-form expression based on a single forward pass, leveraging foundation model representations to estimate influence without gradients.

Result: Matches or outperforms gradient-based methods in identifying impactful examples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value provides an efficient, scalable solution for data valuation in large models, improving interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

### [121] [PakBBQ: A Culturally Adapted Bias Benchmark for QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10186)
*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PakBBQ is a culturally adapted dataset for evaluating bias in LLMs, focusing on Pakistan. It shows improved accuracy with disambiguation and stronger counter-bias in Urdu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of fairness evaluation in LLMs for low-resource languages and regional contexts, particularly in Pakistan.

Method: Introduce PakBBQ, a dataset with 214 templates and 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu, covering 8 bias dimensions. Evaluate multilingual LLMs under ambiguous/disambiguated contexts and negative/non-negative framings.

Result: Findings include a 12% accuracy gain with disambiguation, stronger counter-bias in Urdu, and reduced stereotypes with negative framing.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks and prompt engineering are crucial for bias mitigation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [122] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a lightweight framework to detect Faithfulness Hallucinations in LLMs by measuring semantic divergence between prompts and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of hallucinations in LLMs, specifically confabulations, where responses are arbitrary and misaligned with user queries.

Method: Uses joint clustering on embeddings to create a shared topic space, visualizes dialogue via heatmaps, and computes information-theoretic metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance.

Result: Develops a practical score (S_H) to quantify divergence and identifies KL divergence as a key signal for distinguishing generative behaviors.

Conclusion: SDM provides a diagnostic framework (Semantic Box) to classify LLM response types, including dangerous confabulations.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

Conclusion: Architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for sentiment-aware emoji prediction.

Abstract: This project explores emoji prediction from short text sequences using four
deep learning architectures: a feed-forward network, CNN, transformer, and
BERT. Using the TweetEval dataset, we address class imbalance through focal
loss and regularization techniques. Results show BERT achieves the highest
overall performance due to its pre-training advantage, while CNN demonstrates

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in CHR patients, showing high concordance and reliability, even in foreign languages and longitudinal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The BPRS is underused in clinical practice due to its lengthy structured interview requirement. LLMs offer a scalable solution to standardize and improve symptom assessment in CHR patients.

Method: LLMs were used to predict BPRS scores from unstructured clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients. Performance was evaluated using concordance and ICC metrics, including tests in foreign languages and longitudinal data.

Result: LLMs achieved high concordance (0.84) and ICC (0.73), comparable to human reliability. Performance remained strong in foreign languages (concordance: 0.88, ICC: 0.70) and with longitudinal data.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively predict BPRS scores from unstructured interviews, offering a scalable and standardized tool for monitoring CHR patients, even across languages and over time.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: The study analyzes Toki Pona, a constructed language, using computational methods to track word usage changes and variations, finding it evolves similarly to natural languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Toki Pona, a minimalist constructed language, changes and varies over time and across contexts.

Method: Computational and corpus-based analysis of fluid word classes and transitivity in Toki Pona.

Result: Sociolinguistic factors influence Toki Pona like natural languages, showing constructed languages evolve with community use.

Conclusion: Constructed languages like Toki Pona naturally evolve, mirroring patterns seen in natural languages.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

### [126] [Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching for LLM Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10295)
*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve LLM prompt engineering by leveraging the model's inductive bias, resulting in significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are sensitive to prompt wording, and their inductive bias can be harnessed to create better prompts.

Method: Use the LLM's output as part of its prompt to align wording with its inductive bias (Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching).

Result: Improves Likert ratings for classification by 19% and ranking by 27%.

Conclusion: Aligning prompts with LLM inductive bias enhances performance effectively.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a qualitative framework to detect biases in LLMs, revealing racial and gender biases in generated stories and highlighting limitations in current bias correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current bias detection methods, which often overlook nuanced biases in LLM outputs, by introducing a qualitative approach.

Method: Manual analysis of LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women to investigate gender and racial biases.

Result: Black women were tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appeared in self-discovery, reflecting essentialization. Bias corrections were superficial.

Conclusion: Qualitative methods are crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary, ethical AI development.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in peer review like increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue, and improving automated review quality.

Method: Combines ArXiv-MCP retrieval-augmented context generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with a composite reward function.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in experiments on ICLR 2025 papers, achieving better review quality and rating accuracy.

Conclusion: ReviewRL provides a foundational framework for RL-driven automatic critique generation, with promising potential for future development.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL is an open-source method for forecasting Fantasy Premier League player performance, achieving accuracy comparable to commercial services using public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to high-accuracy player performance forecasts, currently limited to proprietary services.

Method: Position-specific ensemble models optimized on public data (Fantasy Premier League and Understat) from four seasons.

Result: OpenFPL matches commercial accuracy and outperforms for high-return players (>2 points) across 1-3 gameweek horizons.

Conclusion: OpenFPL enables long-term planning and strategic decisions, making high-accuracy forecasts accessible to all.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

TL;DR: xRFM combines feature learning kernel machines with tree structures for tabular data, outperforming 31 methods in regression and competing in classification, while offering interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in AI, tabular data inference still relies on GBDTs. Recent interest in neural networks and feature learning has spurred the development of xRFM to improve performance and scalability.

Method: xRFM integrates feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to adapt to local data structure and handle large datasets.

Result: xRFM outperforms 31 methods, including TabPFNv2 and GBDTs, in regression (100 datasets) and is competitive in classification (200 datasets). It also provides interpretability via the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Conclusion: xRFM is a scalable, high-performing, and interpretable method for tabular data, surpassing traditional GBDTs and competing with modern approaches.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global physical inactivity by leveraging scalable, personalized mHealth interventions like JITAIs, while overcoming methodological challenges in integrating behavioral science.

Method: A large-scale RCT with 13,463 Fitbit users randomized into control, random, fixed, and RL arms, using 155 behavioral science-based nudges. The RL algorithm personalized nudge content and timing.

Result: The RL group showed significant PA increases at 1 and 2 months compared to other groups, with sustained effects (+208 steps vs. control at 2 months, p=0.002).

Conclusion: Behaviorally-informed RL can effectively personalize digital health interventions for scalable PA promotion.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [132] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of forecast stability alongside accuracy in time series forecasting for supply chains, showing that ensemble models improve stability without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand planners prioritize consistency and stability over minor accuracy gains, as unstable forecasts require excessive human intervention and erode trust in ML models.

Method: A case study evaluates the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (e.g., Chronos, DeepAR) on public datasets (M5, Favorita).

Result: Ensemble models enhance stability without significantly reducing accuracy, sometimes even improving it.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for further research on forecast stability in production systems, beyond just accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [133] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs to ensure outputs adhere to formal languages like C++ or JSON, achieving high syntactic and functional correctness with practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to adhere to formal language constraints, limiting their use in applications like code completion or structured data extraction. Existing constrained decoding methods don't work for diffusion LLMs.

Method: The method reduces constrained decoding to an additive infilling problem, then to checking if the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty, with an efficient algorithm for context-free languages.

Result: Empirical tests show near-perfect syntactic correctness and improved functional correctness in tasks like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction, with practical computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of constrained decoding for diffusion LLMs, enabling reliable use in formal language applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

TL;DR: Small LLMs can learn graph tasks via instructive chain-of-thought training, generalizing to new tasks and structures without specialized encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can solve graph tasks without specialized models and generalize to unseen structures or tasks.

Method: Empirical evaluation of LLMs trained with instructive chain-of-thought solutions.

Result: Small LLMs successfully learn and generalize graph tasks without specialized encoders.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively solve and generalize graph tasks with simple training methods.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

TL;DR: CAD-RL is a reinforcement learning framework for generating CAD modeling code from natural language, improving reasoning, precision, and executability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows require expertise and manual effort; automating this with LLMs is challenging due to logical reasoning and precision needs.

Method: Combines Chain-of-Thought guided reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards and optimization strategies like Trust Region Stretch.

Result: Outperforms existing VLMs in reasoning, precision, and executability, supported by the ExeCAD dataset.

Conclusion: CAD-RL advances CAD automation by effectively translating design intent into executable code.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

### [136] [Nested-ReFT: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning via Off-Policy Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10123)
*Maxime Heuillet,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Audrey Durand,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT introduces a computationally efficient ReFT framework by using a subset of model layers as a behavior model, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ReFT frameworks are computationally expensive due to multiple inference steps during training.

Method: Nested-ReFT leverages off-policy RL and speculative decoding, using dynamic layer skipping to reduce inference costs.

Result: Improved computational efficiency (tokens/sec) on math reasoning benchmarks with unbiased gradient estimates.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT balances efficiency and performance, matching baseline ReFT while reducing costs.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

*Yuhan Xie,William Cappelletti,Mahsa Shoaran,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for time series classification, leveraging Neural Collapse and generative pretext tasks, outperforms existing methods on LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretext tasks for pre-training deep neural networks in time series are heuristic and lack guaranteed transferability to downstream classification tasks.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised pre-training strategy using a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier, pseudo-labeling, and generative pretext tasks with sequential augmentation.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks on three multivariate time series classification datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry improves performance in time series classification.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

TL;DR: A post-hoc OOD detection method using counterfactual explanations to measure distance to decision boundaries, improving scalability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety of machine learning systems by providing accurate and explainable OOD detection.

Method: Leverages counterfactual explanations to calculate decision boundary distances, with scalability improvements via embedding space computations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 (93.50% AUROC, 25.80% FPR95), CIFAR-100 (97.05% AUROC, 13.79% FPR95), and ImageNet-200 (92.55% AUROC, 33.55% FPR95).

Conclusion: The method effectively combines accuracy, scalability, and interpretability for OOD detection.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95
across four OOD datasets

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the EM algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR), showing convergence rates and statistical accuracy under balanced and unbalanced mixing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model misspecification affects the EM algorithm's performance in 2MLR, particularly with overspecified components.

Method: Theoretical analysis of EM at population and finite-sample levels, focusing on convergence rates and statistical accuracy for balanced and unbalanced mixing weights.

Result: Linear convergence for unbalanced weights, sublinear for balanced; statistical accuracy varies with weight balance. Connection between population and finite-sample results is shown.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into EM's behavior in overspecified 2MLR, linking theoretical and practical performance under different conditions.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

*Petr Spelda,Vit Stritecky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of evaluating reasoning in language models, showing that performance improvements can stem from impactful benchmarks used as learning curricula, not just model size or algorithmic enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning capabilities in large language models can be improved and generalized, especially through benchmark-driven learning.

Method: The study evaluates reasoning models using impactful benchmarks as curricula, demonstrated with DeepSeek-R1 on a sequential decision-making problem.

Result: Performance improvements in reasoning models can be attributed to benchmark-driven learning, not just test-time algorithms or model size.

Conclusion: Impactful benchmarks can serve as training curricula, making novelty in test tasks crucial for measuring generalization in reasoning models.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven approach using explainable ML to monitor dairy cattle health and behavior, leveraging IoT sensors and robust algorithms for actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of tracking cattle health and optimizing yield for dairy farmers by providing transparent, data-driven solutions.

Method: Utilizes Bluetooth-based IoT devices, 4G networks, and accelerometer data with ML models (e.g., k-nearest neighbor) and explainability frameworks like SHAP.

Result: Achieved high performance (AUC ~0.99) in activity classification, with feature importance analysis for practical use.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective, explainable ML models for sustainable livestock management, aiding farmer decision-making.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-driven analysis of handwritten markings on seized ivory tusks provides a scalable, low-cost forensic method to link trafficking shipments and disrupt wildlife crime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transnational ivory trade drives elephant population declines, but existing forensic methods like DNA analysis are costly or unavailable. Handwritten markings on tusks, though easy to photograph, are rarely analyzed.

Method: An AI pipeline was developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings from 6,085 ivory tusk photos over 6 years. Object detection and AI tools identified 184 recurring "signature markings," linking tusks and shipments.

Result: 20 signature markings connected multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between traffickers. This method complements DNA analysis where genetic data is unavailable.

Conclusion: AI-based handwriting analysis offers a transformative, scalable tool for wildlife forensics, aiding efforts to disrupt organized ivory trafficking.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares D-Wave quantum annealing and Gibbs sampling for RBMs, finding limited overlap and no significant improvement in sampling quality, but hints at potential for hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) using D-Wave quantum annealers and compare it with classical Gibbs sampling, especially under conditions relevant to RBM learning.

Method: Applied a local-valley (LV) centered approach to compare D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM, analyzing the number of LVs and energy of local minima.

Result: No significant improvement in LV count with shorter D-Wave annealing times. D-Wave found more LVs than Gibbs, but many LVs differed. Overlap was low for high-probability states but higher for intermediate ones. Overlap decreased at later training epochs.

Conclusion: D-Wave sampling alone didn't substantially improve RBM training, but a combined classical-quantum approach might hold promise.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable machine learning model (LightGBM) was developed for early AKI prediction in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AKI in cirrhosis patients is common and worsens outcomes, but existing predictive tools lack accuracy and workflow alignment.

Method: Retrospective analysis of MIMIC-IV data, preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of six ML algorithms.

Result: LightGBM performed best (AUROC 0.808), with key predictors aligning with cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms.

Conclusion: The model enables early AKI risk stratification, supports clinical decisions, and warrants further validation and integration.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, focusing on substitution ciphers like mono-alphabetic and Vigenère, to evaluate transformer models' generalization and inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend ICL beyond simple function classes to structured cryptographic tasks, assessing transformers' ability to infer hidden mappings from limited examples.

Method: Uses ICL to train transformer models on small sets of (cipher text, plain text) pairs for mono-alphabetic and Vigenère ciphers, aiming to decode new cipher texts.

Result: Demonstrates transformers' capability to generalize and infer hidden substitution mappings in cryptographic tasks under the ICL paradigm.

Conclusion: ICL is effective for structured cryptographic challenges, highlighting transformers' potential in learning hidden patterns from limited context.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPMI is a retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers, using head-wise pruning and malicious injection to bypass defenses with minimal clean accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and existing methods are resource-intensive or intrusive. HPMI aims to address these limitations.

Method: Prunes the least important head and injects a pre-trained malicious head without retraining or altering architecture.

Result: Achieves 99.55% attack success rate, negligible clean accuracy loss, and bypasses four advanced defenses.

Conclusion: HPMI is effective, concealable, and robust against defenses, outperforming retraining-dependent attacks.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems.

Method: Introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism and a reward-shaping mechanism to integrate local and global feedback for better coordination.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in resource utilization, scheduling latency, and policy convergence, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The method is effective for high-concurrency, high-dimensional tasks, proving practical utility in large-scale scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Motivation: To tackle data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and centralized modeling limitations in multi-tenant cloud environments.

Method: Federated training framework with local model training, parameter aggregation, personalized adjustment, and Mahalanobis distance for anomaly scoring.

Result: Outperforms mainstream models in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with stable performance in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The method shows practical potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively utilize recurring shifts or capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation.

Method: The method involves offline source component decomposition using the EM algorithm and online mixing weight adaptation via convex optimization.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages shift characteristics for superior adaptation performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

### [151] [Uncertainty-Aware Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Medication Needs: A Two-Stage Conformal Prediction Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10284)
*Ricardo Diaz-Rincon,Muxuan Liang,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Benjamin Shickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for Parkinson's Disease medication management provides reliable, uncertainty-quantified forecasts of levodopa dosing needs up to two years ahead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD medication management lacks systematic predictive methods, relying on trial-and-error, which risks inadequate symptom control or side effects due to unquantified uncertainty.

Method: A two-stage approach using electronic health records: first identifying patients needing medication changes, then predicting required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments with conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification.

Result: The framework achieved reliable prediction intervals with marginal coverage, offering precise short-term and broader long-term forecasts, improving decision-making.

Conclusion: Quantifying uncertainty in medication predictions enables evidence-based dosing adjustments, optimizing symptom control and quality of life while minimizing side effects.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBrain is a generative framework for probabilistic modeling of visual-to-neural mapping, outperforming existing methods in fMRI synthesis and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic methods fail to model biological variability while maintaining functional consistency in visual-to-neural mapping.

Method: SynBrain uses BrainVAE for probabilistic neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for high-fidelity fMRI synthesis.

Result: SynBrain excels in subject-specific encoding, few-shot adaptation, and improves fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain captures biological variability and functional consistency, offering interpretable and high-quality fMRI synthesis.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that enhances adapter tuning for new tasks in healthcare by leveraging past knowledge through clustering and bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quick adaptation to new healthcare tasks while preserving privacy and leveraging past experiences.

Method: Uses global clustering and bi-level optimization to personalize knowledge transfer via inter- and intra-cluster weights.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively leverages past knowledge for efficient and privacy-preserving task adaptation in federated healthcare settings.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLIP-Fed is a FL backdoor defense framework using vision-language models to address heterogeneous data and privacy concerns, improving defense and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL backdoor defenses assume homogeneous data or clean server datasets, limiting practicality. CLIP-Fed aims to defend against attacks under heterogeneous data while preserving performance.

Method: CLIP-Fed integrates pre- and post-aggregation defenses, uses multimodal models for dataset augmentation, and aligns global model knowledge with CLIP using prototype contrastive loss and KL divergence.

Result: CLIP-Fed reduces ASR by 2.03% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving MA by 7.92% and 0.48%, respectively.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively defends against backdoor attacks in FL under heterogeneous data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces welfare-centric clustering, focusing on group utilities via distance and representation, and proposes two optimization objectives with novel algorithms and guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fair clustering may lead to undesirable outcomes; the paper advocates for a welfare-centric approach to better model group utilities.

Method: Group utilities are modeled using distances and proportional representation, with two optimization objectives (Rawlsian and Utilitarian) and novel algorithms introduced.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the methods outperform existing fair clustering baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The welfare-centric approach and proposed algorithms significantly improve fair clustering outcomes.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-level IDS framework for IoMT detects zero-day attacks and distinguishes known/unknown threats with high accuracy, addressing limitations of centralized IDSs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized IDSs are unsuitable for IoMT due to delays, privacy risks, and vulnerabilities. Resource constraints make local IDSs infeasible, leaving devices exposed to zero-day attacks.

Method: Proposes a multi-level IDS framework: near Edge uses meta-learning/OCC for coarse attack detection; far Edge and Cloud identify attack type/novelty.

Result: Achieves 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score on CICIoMT2024 dataset. First layer detects zero-day attacks without new datasets.

Conclusion: The framework ensures strong applicability in IoMT, addressing security gaps with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores distribution learning in semantic communication, establishing conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. It reveals a trade-off between immediate performance and long-term learnability, validated by experiments on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inferring underlying meaning distributions in semantic communication, especially when priors are unknown, and to balance immediate performance with adaptation capability.

Method: The study proves learnability conditions (full rank of the transmission matrix), characterizes convergence rates, and quantifies semantic distortion from estimation errors. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate the framework.

Result: Findings show a trade-off: encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often hinder long-term learnability. System conditioning critically impacts learning rate and performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first rigorous analysis of statistical learning in semantic communication, offering design principles for systems balancing performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eMamba is a hardware acceleration framework for Mamba models on edge devices, offering efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of optimized hardware acceleration for Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Replaces complex layers with lightweight alternatives, approximates expensive operations, and uses approximation-aware NAS.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy with fewer parameters, lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced power/energy consumption.

Conclusion: eMamba is efficient and effective for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified evaluation framework for Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) with two new metrics: DIC and BAE, to assess annotator tendency capture and behavioral explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ITL methods lack a framework to evaluate if they truly capture annotator tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Method: Introduces two metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE), using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for alignment.

Result: Experiments validate the framework's effectiveness in evaluating ITL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the gap in evaluating ITL methods, providing tools to assess annotator tendency capture and explanation quality.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XQuant reduces memory consumption for LLM inference through low-bit quantization of layer input activations, achieving up to 10x memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is hindered by high memory demands and bandwidth limitations, exacerbated by modern hardware trends favoring compute over memory.

Method: XQuant quantizes and caches layer input activations (X) instead of KV caching, rematerializing Keys and Values on-the-fly. XQuant-CL further exploits cross-layer similarity for extreme compression.

Result: XQuant achieves up to 7.7x memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation, while XQuant-CL attains 10x savings with 0.01 degradation and 12.5x with 0.1 degradation.

Conclusion: XQuant leverages hardware compute capabilities to overcome memory bottlenecks, outperforming KV cache quantization methods while maintaining near-FP16 accuracy.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for StarCraft II lack full complexity, limiting AI's strategic planning and real-time adaptation capabilities.

Method: Introduces SC2Arena (supports all races, low-level actions, spatial reasoning) and StarEvolve (hierarchical framework with Planner-Executor-Verifier, iterative self-correction, and fine-tuning).

Result: StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning, and SC2Arena enables insights for generalist agents.

Conclusion: The proposed tools advance AI's strategic decision-making in complex environments like StarCraft II.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM's implicit control of norm dynamics in tensorized models is analyzed, leading to the proposal of DAS, a method that mimics SAM's regularization with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand SAM's behavior in general tensorized models and improve its efficiency.

Method: Analyze norm dynamics using scale-invariance, introduce Norm Deviation, and propose DAS to scale core norms adaptively.

Result: DAS matches or outperforms SAM in tasks like tensor completion and model compression with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: DAS effectively replicates SAM's benefits while reducing overhead, making it a practical alternative.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC is a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations by preserving inter-feature dependencies and accommodating user constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods lack generalizability, struggle with complex data dependencies, and often ignore user feasibility constraints, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: RealAC aligns joint distributions of feature pairs to preserve dependencies and allows users to freeze attributes, ensuring realistic and actionable counterfactuals.

Result: RealAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realism, actionability, and dependency preservation across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: RealAC provides a causality-aware, user-centric solution for generating counterfactual explanations, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates per-node explanations during prediction, combining interpretable cues and natural language for transparency in clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack interpretability in high-stakes clinical settings, where trust and local reasoning are critical. Existing methods are post-hoc and global, failing to provide node-level insights.

Method: X-Node constructs structured context vectors for each node, uses a Reasoner module to map these into explanation vectors, and integrates explanations via reconstruction, natural language generation, and feedback into the GNN.

Result: X-Node maintains competitive accuracy on MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST datasets while providing faithful, per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node advances interpretability in GNNs by embedding explanations directly into the prediction process, balancing performance and transparency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

### [165] [GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471)
*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG is a federated graph learning framework addressing class imbalance by using a hierarchical GAN for data augmentation and mutual information-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in federated graph learning (FGL) biases models toward majority classes, impairing performance on rare events.

Method: Proposes GraphFedMIG, a hierarchical GAN framework with client clusters and mutual information-guided generation to synthesize minority-class features.

Result: Outperforms baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG effectively mitigates class imbalance in FGL by generating high-value minority-class features.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

### [166] [EDAPT: Towards Calibration-Free BCIs with Continual Online Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10474)
*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that eliminates calibration by combining population-level pretraining and continual online finetuning, improving accuracy and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs suffer from accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift and user variability, requiring frequent recalibration, which limits deployment.

Method: EDAPT trains a baseline decoder on multi-user data, then continually personalizes it via supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve. It also uses unsupervised domain adaptation for further gains.

Result: EDAPT consistently outperforms static methods across nine datasets, with efficient updates (200ms on consumer hardware). Accuracy scales with total data, not its allocation.

Conclusion: EDAPT offers a practical, calibration-free solution for BCIs, reducing deployment barriers.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how unobserved confounding in recommender systems, caused by practices like feature engineering and A/B testing, can bias results and offers solutions to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unobserved confounding biases causal effects in observational studies, and recommender systems, though seemingly immune, can suffer similarly from ignored features due to standard practices.

Method: The paper uses simulation studies to illustrate how practices like feature engineering and modularization introduce confounding in recommender systems.

Result: Common practices in recommender systems can introduce confounding, negatively impacting performance, as demonstrated through simulations.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt suggested strategies to reduce or avoid confounding in recommender systems to improve accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using neural ODEs and JEPAs to create structured latent state-space models from observation data, demonstrated on a pendulum system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon reconstruction-based methods by leveraging JEPAs for more capable world models, applicable in robotics.

Method: Integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs, enforcing contractive embeddings and Lipschitz constants for structured latent spaces.

Result: Successfully generates structured latent state-space models for a pendulum system using image data.

Conclusion: The method offers a new approach for general control algorithms and estimation techniques in robotics.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: A spectral framework is introduced to analyze smoothness and faithfulness in ReLU network explanations, addressing noise and interpretability issues while quantifying trade-offs and distortions in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks' gradient-based explanations are noisy and hard to interpret due to sharp transitions and reliance on individual pixels. Existing smoothing methods compromise faithfulness.

Method: A spectral framework is proposed to systematically analyze smoothness and faithfulness, regularizing high-frequency contributions in ReLU networks.

Result: The framework quantifies the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness, identifies an "explanation gap," and validates findings across datasets and ablations.

Conclusion: The spectral framework provides a principled approach to understanding and improving explanation quality in ReLU networks, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces automated codebook learning models for multiclass classification using ECOC, outperforming traditional methods in robustness to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECOC methods rely on manual or random codebooks, which are inefficient and may not adapt well to specific datasets.

Method: Three models based on contrastive learning are proposed to learn codebooks directly and adaptively from data.

Result: The models show superior robustness to adversarial attacks on four datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Automated codebook learning via contrastive learning improves ECOC effectiveness for multiclass classification.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework unifying multimodal understanding and generation via decoupled Cognition and Deliberation phases, outperforming state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating autoregressive LLMs for reasoning and diffusion models for generation in multimodal applications.

Method: Uses symbolic multi-agent collaboration in Cognition (Perceiver, Planner, Reflector) and Growth-Aware Search in Deliberation for joint reasoning and generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines and GPT-4o on benchmarks like MME, supporting scalable any-to-any modality conversion.

Conclusion: MAGUS offers flexible, scalable multimodal understanding and generation without joint training.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to train nonlocal transition policies for Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms, improving performance on hard combinatorial optimization problems compared to conventional MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MCMC methods struggle with hard combinatorial optimization problems, especially near computational phase transitions, due to rigid variables and suboptimal basins. NMC algorithms with inhomogeneous temperature profiles were proposed but lacked optimized transition policies.

Method: Deep RL is used to train nonlocal transition policies for NMC, using energy changes as rewards and local minimum energy landscape geometry as states.

Result: The trained RL-based solver outperforms standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard 4-SAT benchmarks in residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Deep RL effectively optimizes NMC transition policies, enhancing exploration and exploitation in combinatorial optimization, with demonstrated improvements on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCD is a test-time framework for joint generation from multiple diffusion models, enforcing constraints without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while enforcing constraints without costly retraining.

Method: Introduces coupled guidance and projection steps in the generative dynamics to coordinate models and enforce constraints.

Result: Effective in image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning, with improved coupling and constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: PCD provides a computationally efficient solution for constrained joint generation without retraining.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Motivation: To enhance personalized product search ranking by leveraging mixed data types and advanced embedding techniques, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Method: Combines tabular and non-tabular data with TinyBERT embeddings, employs a novel sampling technique, and introduces scalable relevance labeling based on click data and semantic similarity.

Result: Outperforms baselines (XGBoost, TabNet, etc.), with ablation studies confirming the benefits of relevance labels, TinyBERT fine-tuning, and embedding interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed MTL framework effectively improves personalized product search ranking by integrating diverse data and advanced techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) for healthcare, addressing privacy-utility trade-offs and class imbalance. It proposes a hybrid SMOTETomek and tuned FedProx to improve model performance, achieving high utility with strong privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative health research while protecting patient privacy, addressing challenges like data imbalance and privacy-utility trade-offs in FL.

Method: Implemented an FL framework for cardiovascular risk prediction, integrating SMOTETomek for imbalance and tuned FedProx for non-IID data.

Result: Identified a non-linear privacy-utility trade-off, achieving high recall (>77%) with strong privacy (epsilon 9.0). Optimized FedProx outperformed FedAvg.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for secure, accurate diagnostic tools in heterogeneous healthcare data, balancing privacy and clinical utility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

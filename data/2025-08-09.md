### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual, a novel framework for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR), combines Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA) to address limitations of traditional methods, outperforming recent techniques in tasks like deraining and dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UHD IR methods like downsampling or frequency-domain transformations suffer from irreversible information loss or ineffectiveness for spatially confined artifacts, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: RetinexDual employs two sub-networks: SAMBA for reflectance correction using a coarse-to-fine mechanism and FIA for frequency-domain color and illumination correction.

Result: RetinexDual outperforms recent methods in tasks like deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement, as shown by qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: RetinexDual's dual-branch design and component effectiveness are validated, offering a superior solution for generalized UHD IR tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENTRep is a 2025 Grand Challenge for ENT endoscopy analysis, combining fine-grained classification with image and text retrieval under bilingual clinical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is hindered by device variability, operator differences, and subtle findings, lacking support in public benchmarks.

Method: Introduces a dataset with expert-annotated images, dual-language descriptions, and three benchmark tasks, evaluated via server-side scoring.

Result: Top-performing teams' results are reported, with insights into performance and challenges.

Conclusion: ENTRep aims to advance ENT care by addressing gaps in automated analysis and retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD unifies knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking and consensus gating, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods are pretrained in isolation, missing complementary insights and producing impractical large models.

Method: CoMAD distills knowledge from three ViT-Base teachers (MAE, MoCo v3, iBOT) using asymmetric masking, linear adapters, and joint consensus gating. Training involves dual-level KL divergence.

Result: ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4% Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and strong performance on MS-COCO, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMAD effectively distills diverse self-supervised knowledge into a compact model, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR introduces a reconstruction-free, attention-based diffusion model for real-time anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based anomaly detection methods are computationally expensive, prone to reconstruction errors, and require prior knowledge of anomalies. RADAR addresses these limitations.

Method: RADAR directly generates anomaly maps from diffusion models without iterative reconstruction, leveraging attention mechanisms for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: RADAR achieves superior performance, improving F1 scores by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on 3D-printed material datasets compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: RADAR offers a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for anomaly detection, eliminating the need for costly reconstruction steps.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective deep learning method using a CNN_LSTM model to track eye movements with 81% accuracy, aiming to improve VR/AR user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate eye tracking is challenging due to rapid eye movements and expensive equipment. The goal is to develop an affordable, interpretable solution for applications in VR/AR.

Method: The CNN_LSTM model is used to predict eye center positions from event camera inputs.

Result: The model achieved approximately 81% accuracy in tracking eye movements.

Conclusion: Future work will focus on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to improve interpretability and performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN is a 3D human motion prediction model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Lucas polynomial activations, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Method: LuKAN uses discrete wavelet transform for temporal encoding, spatial projection for joint dependencies, and a KAN layer with Lucas polynomials for efficient function approximation.

Result: LuKAN outperforms baselines on three datasets, offering competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LuKAN achieves accurate and efficient 3D motion prediction with its compact architecture and Lucas polynomial-based design.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to identify subtle visual clues and integrate them with world knowledge for complex reasoning, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of MLLMs' ability to interpret subtle local details, which are crucial for deep visual understanding and reasoning.

Method: VER-Bench introduces 374 questions across six reasoning types, each with structured evidence (visual clues and derived reasoning), focusing on fine-grained details (0.25% image area).

Result: The benchmark exposes MLLMs' shortcomings in extracting subtle visual evidence and forming evidence-based arguments.

Conclusion: Enhancing models' capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction and reasoning is essential for genuine visual understanding.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM introduces multi-modal queries and dual-stream attention to improve transformer-based object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors struggle with occlusions, localization, and inefficiency due to fixed queries and dense attention.

Method: DAMM uses appearance-based, positional, and random learned queries, along with dual-stream cross-attention for semantic and spatial refinement.

Result: Achieved top performance in AP and recall on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention enhance accuracy and efficiency in object detection.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of label ambiguity in hateful video detection by analyzing fine-grained, timestamp-annotated segments, revealing how coarse annotations introduce noise and affect model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of hate speech in online multimedia content poses societal challenges, but existing detection methods often rely on noisy, video-level annotations that ignore temporal granularity.

Method: The study trims hateful videos from HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate hateful segments, then analyzes their distribution and characteristics.

Result: Coarse annotations introduce semantic overlap and confusion, altering model decision boundaries and reducing classification confidence.

Conclusion: Temporally aware models and benchmarks are needed for robust and interpretable hate speech detection.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that dynamically adapts models to individual test videos, improving generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing highlight detection methods use generic models for all test videos, failing to account for unique video characteristics, which reduces performance.

Method: Highlight-TTA adapts models during testing using an auxiliary task (cross-modality hallucinations) and meta-auxiliary training.

Result: Experiments show Highlight-TTA improves performance of three state-of-the-art models across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA enhances video highlight detection by dynamically adapting to test videos, outperforming fixed models.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to adapt monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) for fisheye images using calibration tokens, avoiding retraining and improving depth estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs trained on perspective images perform poorly on fisheye images due to covariate shift from camera calibration differences.

Method: Introduces calibration tokens to align latent embeddings of fisheye images to perspective images, leveraging existing FMDEs without retraining.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor datasets using a single set of tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts FMDEs for fisheye images, offering a lightweight, self-supervised solution without requiring fisheye training data.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

### [12] [Toward Errorless Training ImageNet-1k](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04941)
*Bo Deng,Levi Heath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feedforward neural network trained on ImageNet 2012 achieves 98.3% accuracy, with 99.69 Top-1 rate, using 322M parameters. Double-labeling issues may hinder 100% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification accuracy on ImageNet using a new training method.

Method: Feedforward artificial neural network trained on ImageNet 2012 with a novel method.

Result: Achieved 98.3% accuracy, 99.69 Top-1 rate, and 285.9 perfectly classified labels per batch.

Conclusion: High accuracy achieved, but double-labeling in the dataset may prevent perfect results.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM enhances VLM adaptation by integrating masked image modeling into prompt learning, improving generalization without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories.

Method: ProMIM uses a masking strategy on visible image patches to generate instance-conditioned prompts, augmenting existing VLM pipelines like CoOp and CoCoOp.

Result: ProMIM consistently improves generalization in zero-shot and few-shot tasks without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM offers a lightweight, effective solution for enhancing vision-language model adaptability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT improves WS-DSGG by enhancing object detection in dynamic scenes using relation-aware knowledge mining and dual-stream fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WS-DSGG methods rely on external object detectors, which perform poorly in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios, leading to inaccurate results.

Method: TRKT uses relation-aware knowledge mining (with attention maps and optical flow) and a dual-stream fusion module to refine object detection.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset.

Conclusion: TRKT effectively addresses the limitations of external detectors in WS-DSGG, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO is a domain-adversarial SSL framework that enhances robustness to domain shift in biomedical imaging, outperforming baselines in learning biologically meaningful representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SSL methods lack robustness to domain shift, a critical issue in biomedical imaging where batch effects obscure true signals.

Method: Integrates a gradient reversal layer into DINOv2 for domain-invariant feature learning, tested on multiplex immunofluorescence images.

Result: Mitigates slide-specific biases, uncovers prognostic phenotype clusters, and improves survival prediction.

Conclusion: AdvDINO is broadly applicable to domains with domain shift and limited annotations, enhancing generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

### [16] [Open-world Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation: A Human-in-the-loop Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04962)
*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse annotations and hierarchical prototype disambiguation to achieve high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation rely on resource-intensive offline learning or dense annotations, limiting practicality. HOW-Seg addresses these issues by incorporating human feedback.

Method: HOW-Seg constructs class prototypes directly on query data, uses sparse human annotations for guidance, refines prototypes with hierarchical disambiguation, and optimizes labels with dense CRF.

Result: HOW-Seg matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods with sparse annotations and achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2 with denser annotations.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg is a practical and effective solution for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, outperforming alternatives with human-in-the-loop refinement.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

### [17] [UGOD: Uncertainty-Guided Differentiable Opacity and Soft Dropout for Enhanced Sparse-View 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04968)
*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive weighting of Gaussians in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve rendering quality in sparse-view scenarios, using learned uncertainties for opacity updates and dropout regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods treat Gaussians equally, leading to overfitting, especially in sparse-view setups. The study explores adaptive weighting to mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes learned uncertainties to guide Gaussian opacity updates and employs soft differentiable dropout regularization to control Gaussian projection and blending.

Result: Outperforms existing sparse-view methods, achieving higher quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians (e.g., 3.27% PSNR improvement over DropGaussian on MipNeRF 360).

Conclusion: Adaptive weighting via learned uncertainties enhances 3DGS performance in sparse-view scenarios, offering better rendering quality and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

*Md Iftekharul Islam Sakib,Yigong Hu,Tarek Abdelzaher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends canvas-based attention scheduling for real-time object detection by introducing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, improving performance on edge platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of executing high-resolution object detection under strict latency constraints on limited computing resources.

Method: Extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling by allowing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Improved quality/cost trade-offs, leading to higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements to canvas-based attention scheduling effectively improve real-time perception performance on edge platforms.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

*Zheng Chen,Mingde Zhou,Jinpei Guo,Jiale Yuan,Yifei Ji,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC is a single-step diffusion image compression model addressing latency and fidelity issues in diffusion-based methods by using informative latents and fidelity guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image compression suffers from high decoding latency and poor fidelity due to multi-step sampling and reliance on generative priors.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained VAE for rich latent information, replaces iterative denoising with single-step decoding, and introduces fidelity guidance and rate annealing training.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in rate-distortion-perception, with a 20x decoding speed improvement over previous diffusion models.

Conclusion: SODEC effectively balances speed, fidelity, and perceptual quality in image compression.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

*Shenglun Chen,Xinzhu Ma,Hong Zhang,Haojie Li,Zhihui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth completion framework leverages depth foundation models for robustness without large-scale training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth completion models degrade in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios due to reliance on limited data. Foundation models offer robustness, inspiring their use here.

Method: The framework uses a depth foundation model to extract environmental cues from RGB images, employs dual-space propagation (3D/2D), and includes a learnable correction module for refinement.

Result: The model excels in OOD scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, as validated on 16 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves remarkable robustness without large-scale training, demonstrating superior performance in depth completion.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

### [21] [Unified modality separation: A vision-language framework for unsupervised domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04987)
*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified modality separation framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using vision-language models (VLMs) to address the modality gap, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct UDA with VLMs transfers only modality-invariant knowledge due to the modality gap, leading to suboptimal performance. The paper aims to leverage both modality-specific and modality-invariant components for better adaptation.

Method: A unified framework disentangles and handles modality-specific and modality-invariant components separately. It uses a modality discrepancy metric to categorize samples and employs prompt tuning for enhanced performance.

Result: The method achieves up to 9% performance gain with 9 times computational efficiency across various backbones, baselines, datasets, and adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the modality gap in UDA, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

*Yue Li,Weifan Wang,Tai Sing Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how familiarity training in a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder induces global context sensitivity in early layers, using LoRA for fast weights, mimicking brain-like rapid learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how rapid learning of global image context occurs in early visual cortex and replicate it in deep neural networks.

Method: A ViT-based autoencoder with LoRA for fast weights is used to study familiarity training's effects on self-attention and latent representations.

Result: Familiarity training aligns early-layer representations with global context, broadens self-attention scope, and is enhanced by LoRA-based fast weights.

Conclusion: Familiarity training introduces global sensitivity in hierarchical networks, and fast-slow weight architectures may model rapid context learning in the brain.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-ReID improves occluded person re-identification by leveraging fine-grained attributes from pre-trained models without extra data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained vision-language models struggle with occluded Re-ID due to neglecting fine-grained attributes, especially for partially visible pedestrians or subtle appearance differences.

Method: AG-ReID uses a two-stage process: generating attribute pseudo-labels and a dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained attributes for feature extraction.

Result: AG-ReID outperforms existing methods on multiple Re-ID datasets, excelling in occlusion handling and subtle attribute differences.

Conclusion: AG-ReID effectively addresses occluded Re-ID challenges by integrating fine-grained attributes, offering robust performance in both occluded and standard scenarios.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRAM, a method for continual learning in videos using compressed vision and rehearsal-based training, reducing memory usage while outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory demands and challenges of continual learning in video streams, enabling efficient, self-sufficient systems.

Method: Uses compressed vision (video codes) instead of raw inputs, refreshes codes to combat forgetting, and trains a classifier via IID sampling from a rolling buffer.

Result: CRAM outperforms prior methods, storing thousands of long videos in under 2 GB, with improved performance on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAM offers a scalable solution for video continual learning with reduced memory footprint, advancing practical deployment.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

TL;DR: MCDRL integrates causal inference with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to improve domain generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing domain-specific confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces challenges due to high variability and domain shifts, leading to poor generalization of VLMs like CLIP in this field.

Method: MCDRL uses CLIP to identify lesion regions and create a confounder dictionary, then trains a causal intervention network to eliminate domain-specific variations while preserving structural information.

Result: MCDRL outperforms other methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robust generalizability.

Conclusion: MCDRL effectively addresses domain generalization in medical imaging by combining causal inference with VLMs, enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset for assessing perceptual quality in AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC), addressing the lack of specialized models in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of quality assessment models for AI-UGC limits user experience and hinders advancement in enhancement methods.

Method: Constructed AU-IQA, a dataset of 4,800 AI-UGC images from three enhancement types (super-resolution, low-light enhancement, denoising), and evaluated existing quality assessment models.

Result: Evaluated traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models on AU-IQA, analyzing their performance on AI-UGC.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved quality assessment models for AI-UGC and provides a benchmark (AU-IQA) for future research.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

TL;DR: A weakly supervised multimodal framework, skin-SOAP, generates structured SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual effort and clinician burnout while matching performance of advanced models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is a major global health issue with high costs. Manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Proposes skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised framework using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes without heavy reliance on manual annotations.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, validated by novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS).

Conclusion: skin-SOAP offers a scalable, clinically grounded solution for automated SOAP note generation, reducing clinician burden and annotation needs.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCSSIM, a novel metric for evaluating image quality in generative AI by focusing on Scene Composition Structure (SCS) preservation, outperforming traditional and neural-network-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image quality metrics fail to adequately assess the structural integrity of generative AI outputs, either being too sensitive to noise or prioritizing aesthetics over geometric relationships.

Method: The authors propose SCSSIM, an analytical, training-free metric that uses statistical measures from Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning to quantify SCS preservation.

Result: SCSSIM shows high invariance to non-compositional distortions and a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, accurately reflecting SCS changes.

Conclusion: SCSSIM is superior for structural evaluation in generative models, ensuring scene composition integrity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAMoBE, a novel framework for video-based person re-identification (ReID), addressing the challenge of discriminative feature selection by hierarchically modeling and adaptively integrating biometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods lack effective discriminative feature selection from query-gallery pairs, limiting performance in dynamic environments.

Method: HAMoBE uses a pre-trained large model (e.g., CLIP) to extract multi-layer features, modeling appearance, body shape, and gait independently. It includes a dual-input decision gating network to dynamically adjust expert contributions.

Result: HAMoBE achieves significant improvements, such as +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy on benchmarks like MEVID.

Conclusion: HAMoBE effectively enhances video-based ReID by mimicking human perceptual mechanisms and dynamically integrating discriminative features.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

*Parth Thakkar,Ankush Agarwal,Prasad Kasu,Pulkit Bansal,Chaitanya Devaguptapu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NiM, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained document understanding in MLLMs, and proposes Spot-IT, a method to enhance MLLMs' detail extraction using patch selection and Gaussian attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack thorough evaluation and capability in locating and reasoning about fine-grained details in complex documents, such as nutritional info in menus or disclaimers in articles.

Method: Proposes Spot-IT, combining intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention to mimic human zoom-and-focus behavior for better detail extraction.

Result: Spot-IT outperforms baselines, especially in precise detail extraction from complex layouts, revealing both strengths and limitations of current MLLMs.

Conclusion: The work advances fine-grained document understanding in MLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Spot-IT and highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

*Yifeng Huang,Zhang Chen,Yi Xu,Minh Hoai,Zhong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualMat introduces a dual-path diffusion framework for PBR material estimation from single images, improving accuracy in albedo and metallic-roughness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate PBR material estimation under complex lighting. DualMat addresses this by leveraging dual latent spaces and feature distillation.

Method: Uses two latent spaces: one for albedo optimization (RGB) and another for material-specialized estimation. Incorporates feature distillation and rectified flow for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 28% better albedo estimation and 39% lower metallic-roughness errors.

Conclusion: DualMat is effective for high-resolution and multi-view inputs, integrating well into image-to-3D pipelines.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS is a two-stage framework for Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) that decouples class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation to improve retention-plasticity balance and reduce catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSS methods suffer from interference between old and new class learning due to tightly coupled segmentation masks and class labels, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: DecoupleCSS uses a two-stage approach: (1) class-aware detection with pre-trained encoders and LoRA adaptation, and (2) class-agnostic segmentation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively balancing retention of past knowledge and learning of new classes.

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS provides a novel solution for CSS, improving continual learning by decoupling detection and segmentation.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

*Ruiyu Li,Changyuan Qiu,Hangrui Cao,Qihan Ren,Yuqing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task by leveraging scene semantics and texture cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image colorization is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, but scene semantics and texture provide useful color cues. The goal is to improve upon regression-based methods by incorporating classification and adversarial learning.

Method: The approach involves building models on prior works, applying modifications for specific scenarios, and comparing results. Classification and adversarial learning are used to address the multi-modal nature of color prediction.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the method aims to improve colorization accuracy by leveraging classification and adversarial techniques.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a novel approach to image colorization by combining classification and adversarial learning, aiming to overcome limitations of regression-based methods.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

*Jian Zhu,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Yue Gong,He Wang,Bo Cheng,Yuhang Ma,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup is a novel makeup transfer framework that eliminates auxiliary face-control components, leveraging source-reference pairs and a lightweight injector for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on complex loss functions or additional modules, introducing errors and suboptimal results. FLUX-Makeup aims to simplify the process while improving quality and identity consistency.

Method: Built on FLUX-Kontext, FLUX-Makeup uses source images as conditional input and introduces RefLoRAInjector for efficient makeup feature extraction. A robust data generation pipeline enhances training supervision.

Result: FLUX-Makeup outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup offers a high-fidelity, identity-consistent, and robust solution for makeup transfer without auxiliary components.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

*Yuxiang Xiao,Yang Hu,Bin Li,Tianyang Zhang,Zexi Li,Huazhu Fu,Jens Rittscher,Kaixiang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaFusion is a prompt-guided framework that dynamically integrates multiple pathology foundation models (PFMs) to improve performance and interpretability in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs have latent biases from diverse pretraining contexts, limiting generalisability and transparency. AdaFusion addresses this by combining knowledge from multiple PFMs.

Method: AdaFusion compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse PFMs, using a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue context.

Result: AdaFusion outperforms individual PFMs on benchmarks for treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference.

Conclusion: AdaFusion enhances performance and interpretability by bridging heterogeneous PFMs, providing insights into model-specific biases.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

*Jingxuan He,Busheng Su,Finn Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGen is a framework for generating long, identity-preserving videos from a single image and pose sequence, using in-context LoRA finetuning and interleaved segment generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with identity drift and short video lengths, limiting their practical use for long, controlled video generation.

Method: PoseGen uses in-context LoRA finetuning for identity preservation and pose conditioning, along with interleaved segment generation for unlimited video length.

Result: PoseGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and produces artifact-free, unlimited-duration videos.

Conclusion: PoseGen addresses key challenges in video generation, offering a scalable solution for long, identity-preserving videos with precise motion control.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty) is a novel FSCIL method that integrates margin penalties to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of data privacy, high acquisition costs, and performance degradation in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) by improving forward compatibility and decision boundaries.

Method: Proposes SMP with Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) for base task learning and Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) for incremental tasks.

Result: SMP outperforms existing methods on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200, balancing base and new class performance.

Conclusion: SMP effectively addresses FSCIL challenges, offering a robust solution for incremental learning with limited data.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHDMIL is a framework for fast and accurate pathological image classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs in multi-instance learning (MIL) for pathological image classification due to processing thousands of patches per gigapixel image.

Method: Proposes AHDMIL with Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN) and Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), using self-distillation and asymmetric distillation to identify relevant patches. Introduces a Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier.

Result: Achieves 5.3% accuracy improvement and 1.2x faster inference on Camelyon16, with consistent gains in AUC, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score across datasets.

Conclusion: AHDMIL effectively reduces inference costs while improving classification performance, validated on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual grounding framework leverages multiple latent expressions from a single textual input to improve object localization by incorporating complementary visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse textual cues, leading to misidentification of similar objects due to the mismatch with rich visual details.

Method: Introduces subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts, along with a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches on benchmarks and excels in generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the visual-textual mismatch, enhancing accuracy in visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedGIN is a Federated Learning framework for multimodal organ segmentation, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues by harmonizing modality-specific intensity distributions without sharing raw data. It shows significant performance improvements in both limited and complete dataset scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model for accurate and robust medical image segmentation across diverse modalities while addressing challenges like data scarcity, domain shift, and privacy restrictions.

Method: Proposes FedGIN, integrating a Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module within a Federated Learning framework to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions during local training. Evaluated on imputed and complete datasets with MRI and CT data.

Result: In limited-data scenarios, FedGIN improved 3D Dice scores by 12-18% on MRI test cases. In complete datasets, it achieved near-centralized performance with 30% and 10% improvements over MRI-only and CT-only baselines, respectively.

Conclusion: FedGIN effectively addresses cross-modality generalization and privacy constraints, offering a promising solution for multimodal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for automatically discovering chronic pain-related features in mice, outperforming manual and existing methods in accuracy and revealing drug efficacy insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing chronic pain in mice rely on manual labeling, which is biased and lacks clarity on representative behaviors.

Method: Uses a universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse action features from video, avoiding human labeling bias.

Result: Achieves 48.41% accuracy in 15-class pain classification (vs. 21.33% for humans, 30.52% for B-SOiD) and 73.1% in 3-class classification. Reveals drug efficacy insights.

Conclusion: The method shows clinical potential for pain research and drug development by providing unbiased, high-accuracy behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

### [42] [Rotation Equivariant Arbitrary-scale Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05160)
*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rotation-equivariant arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) method to address artifacts in high-resolution recoveries by redesigning encoder and INR modules for intrinsic rotation equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common geometric patterns in low-resolution images are often warped, leading to artifacts in high-resolution recoveries. Rotation equivariance can preserve structural integrity.

Method: Redesigns encoder and implicit neural representation (INR) modules to embed rotation equivariance, enabling end-to-end equivariance. Includes theoretical analysis of equivariance error.

Result: Demonstrates superiority on simulated and real datasets, with plug-and-play compatibility for existing ASISR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively maintains structural integrity and orientation in high-resolution recoveries, enhancing ASISR performance.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

*Xuan Wang,Kai Ruan,Liyang Qian,Zhizhi Guo,Chang Su,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-MoGen is a unified framework for text-driven motion generation across humans and animals, addressing morphological challenges with a two-stage approach and a large-scale dataset (UniMo4D). It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human and animal motion separately, missing opportunities for unified representation and generalization. Morphological differences pose challenges for plausibility.

Method: X-MoGen uses a two-stage architecture: a conditional graph variational autoencoder for T-pose priors and an autoencoder for motion encoding, regularized by morphological loss. Masked motion modeling generates motion embeddings from text. A morphological consistency module ensures skeletal plausibility.

Result: X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen species, validated on the UniMo4D dataset (115 species, 119k sequences).

Conclusion: X-MoGen successfully unifies human and animal motion generation, addressing morphological challenges and improving generalization, as demonstrated by superior performance on UniMo4D.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

*Qi Guo,Xiaojun Jia,Shanmin Pang,Simeng Qin,Lin Wang,Ju Jia,Yang Liu,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysPatch is a novel adversarial patch framework for MLLM-based AD systems, optimizing patch location, shape, and content for real-world applicability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs in AD systems are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, but existing methods are ineffective due to MLLMs' complexity.

Method: PhysPatch uses semantic-based mask initialization, SVD-based local alignment loss, and potential field-based mask refinement.

Result: PhysPatch outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM outputs and ensures physically feasible patch placement.

Conclusion: PhysPatch enhances attack effectiveness and real-world deployability for MLLM-based AD systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

*Zewei Wu,Longhao Wang,Cui Wang,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tracklet-enhanced tracker (MTT) is proposed to handle unseen categories in multitarget tracking by integrating adaptive tracklet generation and multi-clue association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen categories due to low-confidence detections, weak constraints, and occlusions.

Method: MTT clusters detections into tracklets using spatio-temporal correlation and associates them using location and appearance clues.

Result: The framework shows competitiveness in benchmark tests for generic multiple object tracking.

Conclusion: MTT effectively addresses challenges in tracking unseen categories with robust tracklet generation and association.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

### [46] [SPA++: Generalized Graph Spectral Alignment for Versatile Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05182)
*Zhiqing Xiao,Haobo Wang,Xu Lu,Wentao Ye,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPA++ is a graph spectral alignment framework for domain adaptation, enhancing both inter-domain transferability and intra-domain discriminability through coarse graph alignment, spectral regularization, and fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior domain adaptation methods focus on inter-domain transferability but neglect intra-domain structures, leading to poor discriminability. SPA++ addresses this tradeoff.

Method: SPA++ combines coarse graph alignment, spectral regularization, neighbor-aware propagation, data augmentation, and consistency regularization.

Result: SPA++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and adaptability across various domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPA++ effectively balances transferability and discriminability, supported by theoretical analysis and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

*Dongchen Si,Di Wang,Erzhong Gao,Xiaolei Qin,Liu Zhao,Jing Zhang,Minqiang Xu,Jianbo Zhan,Jianshe Wang,Lin Liu,Bo Du,Liangpei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEX is a multimodal LLM for land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by leveraging spectral priors and textual attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models underutilize spectral information, leading to suboptimal performance in multispectral scenarios.

Method: Constructs the SPIE dataset with spectral priors, introduces SPEX with multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five public datasets and generates interpretable textual explanations.

Conclusion: SPEX advances land cover extraction by integrating spectral and textual data, enhancing performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

### [48] [EndoMatcher: Generalizable Endoscopic Image Matcher via Multi-Domain Pre-training for Robot-Assisted Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05205)
*Bingyu Yang,Qingyao Tian,Yimeng Geng,Huai Liao,Xinyan Huang,Jiebo Luo,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoMatcher is a generalizable endoscopic image matcher using large-scale, multi-domain pre-training and a two-branch Vision Transformer for robust feature matching in challenging endoscopic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense feature matching in endoscopic images is essential for robot-assisted tasks but is hindered by difficult visual conditions and lack of annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks and is trained on Endo-Mix6, a multi-domain dataset of 1.2M real/synthetic image pairs, using a progressive multi-objective strategy.

Result: EndoMatcher improves inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on Hamlyn and Bladder datasets, and MDPA by 9.40% on Gastro-Matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher achieves accurate, dense matching in challenging endoscopic conditions and generalizes well to unseen domains, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

### [49] [VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211)
*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFlowOpt is a token pruning framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that reduces computational costs by pruning 90% of visual tokens while maintaining performance, cutting KV-Cache memory by 89% and speeding up inference by 3.8x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods in LMMs are simplistic and cause performance degradation, necessitating a more advanced framework.

Method: VFlowOpt introduces an importance map based on attention-derived relevance and entropy, a progressive pruning module with recycling, and a visual information flow-guided optimization method.

Result: The framework prunes 90% of tokens with minimal performance loss, reducing KV-Cache memory by 89% and accelerating inference by 3.8x.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt offers an efficient and effective solution for token pruning in LMMs, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### [50] [Textual and Visual Guided Task Adaptation for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05213)
*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a source-free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) method using textual and visual information for target domain adaptation without source data, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Few-Shot Segmentation due to domain discrepancies and privacy/data transfer concerns.

Method: Uses Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) and alignment modules (VVEA, TVEA) for feature adaptation and cross-modal guidance.

Result: Achieves 2.18% (1-shot) and 4.11% (5-shot) accuracy improvements across four datasets.

Conclusion: The method outperforms state-of-the-art CD-FSS approaches, demonstrating effective source-free adaptation.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a vision-language tracking framework using Qwen2.5-VL, optimized with SFT and GRPO, and validated on a new dataset TNLLT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods lack flexibility and reasoning insights, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes ReasoningTrack with Qwen2.5-VL, using SFT and GRPO for optimization, and introduces the TNLLT dataset.

Result: Validated on multiple benchmarks, showing effectiveness of the reasoning-based language generation strategy.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack improves vision-language tracking by integrating reasoning and large-model advantages, supported by the TNLLT dataset.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

*Semanur Küçük,Cosimo Della Santina,Angeliki Laskari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM v2.1) effectively segments irregular gas bubbles in multiphase flows using minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to segment deformed or coalesced bubbles, which are common in industrial applications like air lubrication systems.

Method: The study uses transfer learning to adapt the SAM v2.1 model for segmenting non-convex bubble structures with only 100 annotated images.

Result: The fine-tuned SAM v2.1 accurately segments highly irregular bubble shapes.

Conclusion: Modern vision foundation models like SAM can address the challenge of segmenting complex bubble structures in industrial settings.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen is a diffusion-based framework for generating controllable camera images from arbitrary viewpoints, using FAVS and CVC-SSL to address the lack of ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating high-fidelity images from unseen viewpoints due to missing ground-truth data in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) for hierarchical matching and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL) for self-supervised training.

Result: Generates controllable arbitrary-view camera images without needing additional sensors or depth maps.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen is the first method for controllable arbitrary view generation in multiple vehicle configurations.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Result: Identifies evolution from alignment-preserving methods to embedding space re-engineering and latent-space purification.

Conclusion: Key challenges remain, with future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial pre-training.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies

TL;DR: RegionMed-CLIP is a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework for medical image understanding, addressing data scarcity and global feature limitations by integrating localized pathological signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in medical image understanding include limited annotated data and reliance on global features, which miss subtle pathological regions.

Method: Introduces RegionMed-CLIP with an ROI processor for fine-grained regional features and progressive training for multimodal alignment. Uses MedRegion-500k dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive pre-training is critical, and RegionMed-CLIP advances multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews gender classification methods, focusing on facial and iris biometrics, and highlights gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is useful in surveillance, profiling, and human-computer interaction, with soft biometrics like facial and iris features being key.

Method: The study reviews existing gender classification approaches, emphasizing facial and iris-based methods, and discusses segmentation and encoding techniques.

Result: The paper provides an analysis of current methods, identifies gaps, and suggests future improvements.

Conclusion: The study serves as a resource for researchers, outlining challenges and potential advancements in gender classification.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on costly bottom-up optimization of 2D features, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: The method involves weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians, training a per-Gaussian autoencoder, and adaptive sparsification to optimize and prune redundant Gaussians.

Result: CF3 achieves competitive performance using only 5% of the Gaussians required by Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: The proposed top-down pipeline offers a compact and fast solution for 3D Gaussian feature fields, significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

*Suresh Guttikonda,Maximilian Neidhart,Johanna Sprenger,Johannes Petersen,Christian Detter,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks is proposed for robust real-time tracking of cardiac features during bypass surgery, outperforming deep learning and conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods struggle with heart motion and image fluctuations during coronary bypass grafting, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method uses particle filtering with cyclic-consistency checks to track 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps.

Result: Achieves a tracking error of 5.00 +/- 0.22 px, significantly better than deep learning (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Conclusion: The method enables real-time, accurate tracking for cardiac perfusion estimation during interventions.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional
trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Zhen Hua,Yakun Ju,Wei Zhou,Jun Liu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse is a conditional diffusion model guided by SAM for high-fidelity, semantically-aware infrared and visible image fusion, addressing detail loss and artifacts in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods lack deep semantic understanding, leading to key target loss and artifacts, compromising image quality and task performance.

Method: SGDFuse uses SAM-generated semantic masks as explicit priors in a two-stage process: preliminary fusion followed by conditional diffusion for refinement.

Result: SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in subjective/objective evaluations and downstream task adaptability.

Conclusion: SGDFuse effectively addresses core IVIF challenges, offering a powerful solution with high fidelity and semantic awareness.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces B4DL, a benchmark for training and evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on 4D LiDAR data, addressing the lack of high-quality annotations and suitable architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D LiDAR data is underexplored in MLLMs due to missing annotations and processing capabilities, despite its potential for dynamic outdoor scene understanding.

Method: The authors propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that directly processes raw 4D LiDAR data, integrating it with language understanding.

Result: The benchmark, dataset, and model provide a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments.

Conclusion: B4DL and the proposed model advance 4D LiDAR understanding in MLLMs, offering tools for future research in dynamic scene analysis.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

### [61] [Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05271)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes WGDF, a wavelet-guided method for remote sensing change detection, enhancing edge and fine-grained change detection by leveraging frequency-domain features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods rely on spatial-domain modeling, limiting feature diversity and hindering detection of subtle changes. Frequency-domain modeling, particularly wavelet transforms, can better capture fine-grained differences.

Method: WGDF uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components. It includes modules for edge enhancement (DFFE), fine-grained change modeling (FDID), global semantic capture (Transformers), and progressive refinement (PCDM).

Result: WGDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing edge ambiguity and improving detection accuracy and robustness on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain modeling, especially wavelet-guided approaches, significantly enhances change detection in remote sensing, offering superior performance for subtle and edge changes.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

### [62] [MELLA: Bridging Linguistic Capability and Cultural Groundedness for Low-Resource Language MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05502)
*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-resource languages by introducing MELLA, a dataset enhancing linguistic capability and cultural groundedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual enhancement methods for MLLMs lack multimodal informativeness and cultural awareness, crucial for low-resource languages.

Method: A dual-source strategy collects native web alt-text for cultural groundedness and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability, implemented as the MELLA dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA improves performance across eight languages, yielding 'thick descriptions' due to enhanced cultural and linguistic capabilities.

Conclusion: MELLA effectively bridges the gap in MLLM performance for low-resource languages by combining cultural and linguistic enhancements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

*Meiqi Wu,Yaxuan Kang,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu,Xiaotang Chen,Yunfeng Kang,Weiqiang Wang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method (VS-LLM) to analyze PPAT sketches for depression assessment, improving accuracy by 17.6% over traditional psychologist evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of PPAT sketches in the Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is labor-intensive and subjective, requiring an automated solution.

Method: The VS-LLM method combines visual-semantic analysis with LLM for automated depression assessment from PPAT sketches, addressing challenges like low drawing accuracy.

Result: The method outperforms psychologist assessments by 17.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances automated mental state assessment via PPAT sketches, with datasets and code made publicly available.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

*Xuyang Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCAViT addresses the generalization gap in smaller models by introducing CoCA, a dynamic attention mechanism, achieving robust performance on OOD data with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller models show disproportionate performance drops on OOD data, highlighting a need for better generalization in efficient architectures.

Method: Identifies architectural bottlenecks and introduces Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) for dynamic, domain-aware global tokens.

Result: CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with strong OOD performance and low latency.

Conclusion: CoCAViT offers a robust, efficient visual backbone with superior generalization and real-time capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes mKG-RAG, a multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework for VQA, integrating structured multimodal KGs into RAG to improve accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RAG-based VQA methods often introduce irrelevant content due to unstructured knowledge and lack of structural relationships, reducing answer quality.

Method: The framework uses MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to build multimodal KGs, along with a dual-stage retrieval strategy for efficient and precise knowledge retrieval.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-based VQA.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal KGs into RAG enhances VQA by providing structured knowledge, improving accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method inspired by Textual Inversion (TI) to enhance open-vocabulary object detection in VLMs, retaining zero-shot capabilities while learning new tokens from minimal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of zero-shot and natural language querying capabilities in VLMs during fine-tuning for specific targets.

Method: Uses Textual Inversion (TI) to learn new or improve existing tokens for detecting novel or fine-grained objects, keeping original VLM weights frozen.

Result: The method retains original benchmark performance and zero-shot capabilities while requiring less compute than full-model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods by avoiding forgetting and maintaining compatibility with original VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGabSplat improves 3DGS by using 3D Gabor-based primitives for better high-frequency detail capture, efficiency, and memory use, outperforming 3DGS in rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with high-frequency details, redundant primitives, and inefficiency. 3DGabSplat aims to address these limitations.

Method: Uses 3D Gabor-based primitives with multiple directional frequency responses, a CUDA-based rasterizer, and frequency-adaptive optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with fewer primitives and lower memory use.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat enhances 3DGS, offering superior rendering quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-CoT is a unified Chain-of-Thought framework for multimodal reasoning, combining image understanding and generation to model visual state transitions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CoT to vision-language tasks is challenging due to fragmented architectures and limited visual state transition modeling.

Method: Introduces a two-level reasoning paradigm (Macro-Level for planning, Micro-Level for execution) and a structured training approach with interleaved supervision.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks (WISE, RISE, KRIS) with efficient training on 8 A100 GPUs.

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is a scalable and coherent solution for multimodal reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG is a novel framework for chest X-ray report generation that integrates patient-specific prior knowledge (clinical context and prior images) to improve diagnostic accuracy and report quality, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect patient-specific prior knowledge, leading to reports that miss diagnostic intent or disease progression. PriorRG addresses this gap by emulating real-world clinical workflows.

Method: PriorRG uses a two-stage pipeline: (1) prior-guided contrastive pre-training to align features with clinical context, and (2) prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding to integrate prior knowledge during report generation.

Result: PriorRG achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score gains on MIMIC-CXR, and 5.9% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN.

Conclusion: PriorRG effectively leverages prior knowledge to enhance report accuracy and fluency, demonstrating its potential to reduce radiologists' workload while maintaining clinical relevance.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Yong Du,Yuchen Yan,Fei Tang,Zhengxi Lu,Chang Zong,Weiming Lu,Shengpei Jiang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO improve GUI grounding accuracy by leveraging spatial overlap patterns and test-time reinforcement learning, achieving 2-3% gains without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods rely on costly pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. The paper aims to exploit implicit confidence signals from spatial overlap patterns for more accurate localization.

Method: Proposes GUI-RC, a test-time scaling method using spatial voting grids, and GUI-RCPO, which transforms consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning.

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on ScreenSpot benchmarks; GUI-RCPO further boosts performance, e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 83.57% to 85.14%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of test-time scaling and reinforcement learning for robust, data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [71] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc is a two-stage method for cross-view localization (CVL) that improves reliability and accuracy by dividing query images into sub-images, validating poses, and quantifying meaningfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVL methods lack redundant observations for reliability assessment, making it hard to validate localization accuracy.

Method: Slice-Loc divides query images into sub-images, estimates 3-DoF poses for each, filters errors using geometric rigidity, and merges inliers for the final pose. It also quantifies meaningfulness via false alarm estimation.

Result: Slice-Loc reduces errors exceeding 10m to under 3%, cuts mean localization error from 4.47m to 1.86m, and orientation error from 3.42° to 1.24° in cross-city tests.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc enhances CVL accuracy and reliability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by validating poses and detecting failures.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

*Hamza Kalisch,Fabian Hörst,Jens Kleesiek,Ken Herrmann,Constantin Seibold*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH is a hierarchical graph attention network for automated radiology report generation, improving accuracy by modeling organ relationships and integrating pretrained 3D feature encoders with a large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating radiology report generation to assist radiologists by addressing the limitations of current methods that miss fine-grained organ relationships.

Method: Uses a hierarchical graph attention network (CT-GRAPH) with pretrained 3D feature encoders and anatomical masks to model organ relationships, integrated with a large language model for report generation.

Result: Achieves a 7.9% absolute improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods on the CT-RATE dataset.

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH effectively models anatomical relationships and enhances report generation, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

*Mingxi Fu,Xitong Ling,Yuxuan Chen,Jiawen Li,fanglei fu,Huaitian Yuan,Tian Guan,Yonghong He,Lianghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework with deformable attention improves pathology image analysis by dynamically capturing spatial dependencies among tissue patches, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MIL and static GNNs fail to adequately model spatial dependencies and lack specificity in attention mechanisms for pathology images.

Method: Proposes a dynamic weighted directed GNN with deformable attention, incorporating learnable spatial offsets based on patch coordinates to adaptively focus on relevant regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification).

Conclusion: The deformable attention mechanism effectively captures complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

*Wonjun Kang,Byeongkeun Ahn,Minjae Lee,Kevin Galim,Seunghyuk Oh,Hyung Il Koo,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNCAGE is a training-free method using contrastive attention to improve text-to-image generation by prioritizing unmasking of clear object tokens, enhancing compositional fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate attribute binding and text-image alignment in Masked Generative Transformers, which, like Diffusion Models, struggle with compositional T2I generation.

Method: Proposes UNCAGE, leveraging attention maps to prioritize unmasking tokens representing individual objects, improving fidelity without training.

Result: UNCAGE enhances performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluations across benchmarks with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE effectively improves compositional T2I generation in Masked Generative Transformers, offering a practical solution with negligible overhead.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueBiometric is a novel approach to detect and correct poisoned images in biometric systems using majority voting with vision-language models, achieving 100% accuracy without affecting clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where manipulated training data can compromise security. Existing defenses struggle to balance detection and data utility.

Method: TrueBiometric uses majority voting with multiple vision-language models to detect poisoned images and applies targeted corrective noise to mitigate attacks.

Result: The method achieves 100% accuracy in detecting and correcting poisoned images while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric provides a practical and effective solution for securing biometric systems against backdoor attacks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

*Jiawei Liang,Siyuan Liang,Jianjie Huang,Chenxi Si,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adversarial camouflage framework improves attack success rates on deep object detectors by addressing gradient optimization challenges in variable physical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical adversarial camouflage poses security risks to deep object detectors, especially in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving, due to inconsistent sampling and gradient conflicts.

Method: Proposes a gradient calibration strategy for consistent updates and a gradient decorrelation method to stabilize multi-angle optimization.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in attack success rates (13.46% across distances, 11.03% across angles) over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances adversarial attack effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust detector designs in real-world applications.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothSA improves Slot Attention (SA) by preheating cold-start queries and differentiating transforms for video frames, enhancing object-centric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start queries in SA lack sample-specific cues, hindering precise aggregation, and non-first video frames require different transforms. SmoothSA addresses these issues.

Method: SmoothSA preheats cold-start queries with input features via a self-distilled module and differentiates transforms for first and non-first video frames (full vs. single iterations).

Result: Experiments show effectiveness in object discovery, recognition, and benchmarks. Analyses confirm smoother SA iterations and recurrences.

Conclusion: SmoothSA successfully addresses SA's limitations, improving performance in object-centric learning tasks.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIxLIP introduces a game-theory-based method for explaining cross-modal interactions in vision-language models, outperforming first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current saliency maps in language-image pre-training (LIP) models only capture first-order attributions, missing complex cross-modal interactions.

Method: FIxLIP uses the weighted Banzhaf interaction index for flexible and efficient decomposition of similarity in vision-language encoders.

Result: FIxLIP outperforms first-order methods on benchmarks like MS COCO and ImageNet-1k and aids in model comparison.

Conclusion: FIxLIP provides high-quality explanations and practical utility for comparing vision-language models.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new unsupervised anomaly detection method using Flow Matching (FM) is proposed, addressing limitations of conventional flow-based methods. It introduces time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) interpolation for better control, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome expressivity limitations of conventional flow-based methods in unsupervised anomaly detection and localization.

Method: Introduces time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to transform data distributions into Gaussian and control sample trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection at a single scale.

Conclusion: The proposed WT-Flow method provides a theoretically grounded and scalable solution for anomaly detection, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (PAS) and a method (F2PASeg) for pituitary anatomy segmentation in surgery, addressing data scarcity and feature inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pituitary tumors deform adjacent structures, risking surgery. Segmentation can warn surgeons of risky areas, improving safety, but annotated datasets are rare.

Method: PAS dataset with 7,845 images from 120 videos, augmented for class balance. F2PASeg uses a Feature Fusion module to combine high-resolution and deep semantic features for robust segmentation.

Result: F2PASeg segments critical structures in real time, handling occlusions and variations effectively.

Conclusion: F2PASeg provides a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning, enhancing safety.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lossy compression preprocessing defends against adversarial attacks, but realistic reconstructions increase attack difficulty. High-fidelity compression models resist attacks, while low-realism ones fail. Realism, not gradient masking, provides robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of lossy compression in defending against adversarial attacks and understand the role of image realism in robustness.

Method: Construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models, evaluating their resistance.

Result: High-fidelity, realistic reconstructions resist attacks; low-realism models are vulnerable. Realism, not gradient masking, provides robustness.

Conclusion: Realistic reconstructions pose a challenge for adversarial attacks, suggesting realism is key for robust security evaluation.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes OND knowledge-based prompting to improve semantic segmentation of historical maps using foundation models, outperforming UNet baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack consistency in patterns, making it hard for pre-trained foundation models to perform well.

Method: Introduces OND prompting to guide models with explicit prompts, replacing SAM's prompt encoder and fine-tuning on historical maps.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg accurately segments classes defined by OND knowledge and adapts to unseen classes with few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OND prompting enhances segmentation of historical maps, offering flexibility and outperforming traditional methods like UNet.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Motivation: Manual effort in industrial anomaly detection is inefficient; AutoIAD aims to automate the process for better quality control.

Method: Uses a Manager-Driven central agent to coordinate specialized sub-agents and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base for end-to-end automation.

Result: AutoIAD outperforms general-purpose agentic frameworks and AutoML in task completion and AUROC, with reduced hallucination issues.

Conclusion: The Manager central agent and domain knowledge base are critical for robust industrial anomaly detection solutions.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline for shape analysis, addressing the gap in chirality-aware descriptors for point clouds and meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chirality information is crucial but underdeveloped in shape analysis, and existing descriptors often fail to distinguish left-right symmetry.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses the Diff3F framework to extract chirality-aware features from 2D foundation models, decorating shape vertices with this information.

Result: Evaluated on diverse datasets, the features show effectiveness in tasks like left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in chirality-aware shape descriptors, demonstrating practical utility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI improves hand-object reconstruction from monocular videos by using novel view synthesis diffusion models as a prior for unseen object regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object templates or assume full visibility, leading to implausible reconstructions in real-world scenarios with limited viewpoints.

Method: MagicHOI integrates a novel view synthesis model and visible contact constraints to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions.

Result: MagicHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively uses diffusion priors to enhance reconstruction.

Conclusion: Novel view synthesis diffusion priors significantly improve 3D hand-object reconstruction under limited viewpoint variation.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework for event cameras enhances feature extraction from sparse, noisy data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in tasks like object recognition and optical flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and dynamic range but produce sparse, noisy data, complicating feature extraction.

Method: The framework includes Difference-guided Masked Modeling, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning to extract and refine event data features.

Result: The framework demonstrates robustness and superior performance in downstream tasks like object recognition and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages event data, offering improved performance and versatility for vision tasks.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The

### [87] [Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514)
*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced pedestrian tracking framework to address occlusion challenges by integrating richer feature representations, head keypoint detection, and an iterative Kalman filtering motion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pedestrian tracking faces occlusion issues, especially in crowded scenes, where traditional methods relying on full-body features and linear motion assumptions fail.

Method: The method combines detection features from regression and classification branches, uses head keypoint detection for robustness, and employs iterative Kalman filtering with 3D priors for motion modeling.

Result: The proposed framework improves tracking stability and accuracy in occlusion-heavy environments.

Conclusion: The enhanced tracking method effectively handles occlusions in crowded scenes, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

*Ekaterina Shumitskaya,Dmitriy Vatolin,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A certified defense method for IQA models using randomized smoothing in feature space, preserving image quality while ensuring robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods degrade image quality by injecting noise in input space; this work aims to maintain fidelity while providing robustness.

Method: Randomized smoothing in feature space, analyzing the backbone network's Jacobian for noise-perturbation connection. Supports FR and NR IQA models without architectural changes.

Result: Reduces inference time by 99.5% without certification and 20.6% with certification. Improves correlation with subjective scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, preserves image quality, and outperforms existing certified defenses.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical trial data cleaning is inefficient due to increasing data volumes and complexity, creating a bottleneck in drug development.

Method: Octozi combines large language models with domain-specific heuristics to assist clinical reviewers in data cleaning.

Result: AI assistance increased throughput by 6.03-fold, reduced errors from 54.67% to 8.48%, and cut false positives by 15.48-fold.

Conclusion: AI-assisted approaches can transform clinical trial operations, accelerating drug development while maintaining compliance.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

*Shaowu Chen,Wei Ma,Binhua Huang,Qingyuan Wang,Guoxin Wang,Weize Sun,Lei Huang,Deepu John*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimal Brain Connection, a structural pruning framework that addresses the neglect of parameter interconnections in existing methods. It uses the Jacobian Criterion for evaluating parameter saliency and the Equivalent Pruning mechanism to retain contributions of pruned connections during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods often ignore the interconnections among parameters, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework employs the Jacobian Criterion to evaluate parameter saliency by capturing intra-component and inter-layer dependencies, and the Equivalent Pruning mechanism uses autoencoders to retain contributions of pruned connections during fine-tuning.

Result: The Jacobian Criterion outperforms other metrics in preserving model performance, and the Equivalent Pruning mechanism reduces performance degradation post-fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing pruning methods by considering parameter interconnections and maintaining performance.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

TL;DR: SSTGNN is a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network for detecting AI-generated videos, outperforming state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AI-generated videos is challenging due to diverse manipulation types and the limitations of existing methods relying on isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information.

Method: SSTGNN uses a graph-based framework with learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling to jointly analyze spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies.

Result: SSTGNN achieves superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain settings, is robust against unseen manipulations, and uses 42.4× fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SSTGNN is a highly effective, lightweight, and scalable solution for detecting AI-generated videos, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for brand safety classification in content moderation, introducing a novel dataset and evaluating their accuracy and cost efficiency against human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of online video content has made manual moderation impractical, necessitating automated solutions for nuanced multimodal understanding.

Method: The study introduces a multimodal, multilingual dataset labeled by professionals and evaluates MLLMs (Gemini, GPT, Llama) for brand safety classification.

Result: MLLMs show effectiveness in brand safety but have limitations, with detailed analysis of accuracy, cost efficiency, and failure cases provided.

Conclusion: The paper highlights MLLMs' potential in content moderation while acknowledging their limitations, releasing the dataset to aid future research.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action Discovery, a method for handling ambiguous and incomplete action annotations in datasets, using a two-step approach to segment and classify unknown actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ambiguous actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets, especially in domains like neuroscience where subtle behaviors are often overlooked.

Method: A two-step approach: 1) Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) for temporal segmentation, and 2) Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) for semantic classification of unknown actions.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines on datasets like Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly.

Conclusion: Action Discovery effectively handles partially labeled datasets by leveraging known annotations to guide the discovery of unknown actions.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes Follow-Your-Instruction, an MLLM-driven framework for synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data to address the challenges of costly and time-consuming real-world data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for AI-generated content requires diverse, scalable data, but real-world data collection is expensive and slow. Existing methods lack scalability and accuracy.

Method: Uses MLLM-Collector for asset collection, MLLM-Generator and MLLM-Optimizer for semantic refinement, and MLLM-Planner for temporal coherence in 4D tasks.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improves baseline model performance in 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction is a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART framework enhances VLP models for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition by integrating adaptive intra-class refinement and inter-class transfer using LLM-derived knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLP models struggle with fine-grained localization and lack explicit structured relational knowledge, limiting performance in OV-MLR.

Method: DART uses Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) for intra-class refinement and Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) with a Class Relationship Graph (CRG) for inter-class transfer.

Result: DART achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART effectively addresses limitations of VLP models in OV-MLR by combining adaptive refinement and transfer, validated by superior results.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: WeTok tokenizer improves vision generation with Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ) and Generative Decoding (GD), outperforming prior methods in fidelity and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers struggle with balancing compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Introduces GQ for efficient quantization and GD for probabilistic modeling of visual data, enhancing reconstruction.

Result: Achieves record-low zero-shot rFID (0.12) and superior compression (768x) with high fidelity.

Conclusion: WeTok sets a new standard for visual tokenizers, offering scalable and high-fidelity performance.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating image-text relevancy is crucial for multimodal generative AI, but it's challenging due to diverse text formats and varying relevancy definitions. MLLMs are ideal for this task.

Method: LLaVA-RE, based on the LLaVA architecture, uses detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. A novel binary relevancy dataset is also introduced.

Result: Experiments confirm the effectiveness of LLaVA-RE in evaluating image-text relevancy.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE successfully leverages MLLMs for binary relevancy evaluation, offering a flexible and effective solution.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: Hi3DEval is a hierarchical framework for evaluating 3D generative content, combining object- and part-level analysis with material realism assessment. It outperforms image-based metrics and aligns better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D quality assessment methods are limited to image-based metrics and object-level analysis, lacking spatial coherence, material authenticity, and local detail evaluation.

Method: Hi3DEval integrates hierarchical evaluation (object- and part-level) and material realism assessment. It uses Hi3DBench (a dataset with annotations) and a 3D-aware automated scoring system with hybrid representations (video-based for object-level, pretrained 3D features for part-level).

Result: The framework outperforms image-based metrics in capturing 3D characteristics and aligns better with human preferences.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval provides a scalable, holistic alternative to manual evaluations for 3D generative content.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 is a challenging dataset for video object segmentation (VOS) designed to test real-world complexities, showing current methods struggle with its advanced scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS datasets focus on simple, salient objects, limiting real-world applicability. MOSEv2 addresses this by introducing complex scenes.

Method: MOSEv2 includes 5,024 videos with 701,976 masks, featuring challenges like occlusions, adverse weather, and small objects.

Result: Performance of 20 VOS methods drops significantly on MOSEv2, e.g., SAM2 from 76.4% to 50.9%.

Conclusion: Current VOS methods lack robustness in real-world conditions, and MOSEv2 serves as a benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: GAP converts colorless 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians using text guidance, multi-view optimization, and surface-anchoring for geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians is crucial, especially for colorless point clouds, which lack existing conversion methods.

Method: GAP uses a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, surface-anchoring for geometry, and diffuse-based inpainting for hard-to-observe regions.

Result: GAP successfully generates high-fidelity 3D Gaussians from point clouds, tested on synthetic and real-world scans, including large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: GAP advances point-to-Gaussian conversion, offering a robust solution for high-quality rendering from colorless point clouds.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

### [101] [FaceAnonyMixer: Cancelable Faces via Identity Consistent Latent Space Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05636)
*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer is a cancelable face generation framework that synthesizes privacy-preserving face images by mixing latent codes, ensuring revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility while maintaining recognition utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in face recognition by developing a method that protects identity without compromising recognition utility, meeting biometric template protection requirements.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained generative model's latent space to mix real face latent codes with synthetic codes from revocable keys, refined via multi-objective loss.

Result: Generates high-quality cancelable faces compatible with existing FR systems, achieving over 11% better privacy protection on commercial APIs compared to recent methods.

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer effectively balances privacy protection and recognition accuracy, offering a robust solution for cancelable face generation.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

### [102] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based system for prescriptive maintenance combines vibration analysis with multi-agentic generation to provide actionable recommendations, improving industrial machinery maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance industrial maintenance by moving beyond anomaly detection to offer intelligent, actionable recommendations using LLMs.

Method: Integrates bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi-agentic generation, serializing data into natural language for LLM processing and leveraging semantic search for procedural knowledge.

Result: Effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance, validated on bearing vibration datasets.

Conclusion: The system bridges condition monitoring and actionable planning, advancing LLM applications in industrial maintenance with a scalable framework.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Conclusion: GeoFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial benchmarking framework using board games to evaluate LLMs, introducing Qi Town for systematic assessment via Elo ratings, PLG, and PSS. Results show LLMs' adaptability but highlight instability in skill play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Q&A-based benchmarks by using adversarial board games for a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.

Method: Developed Qi Town, a platform with 5 games and 20 LLM players, using Elo ratings, PLG, and PSS in a round-robin tournament.

Result: LLMs show optimism and adaptability in adversarial settings but exhibit instability in skill play, as revealed by PLG analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively evaluates LLMs, revealing both strengths (adaptability) and weaknesses (instability), suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares three methods for autonomous web-based GIS, favoring a client-side SLM approach for accuracy and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy and scalability issues in cloud-based LLMs for AWebGIS.

Method: Compared three approaches: cloud-based LLMs, offline classical ML, and client-side SLM (T5-small).

Result: Client-side SLM achieved highest accuracy (0.93 exact match) and efficiency.

Conclusion: Browser-executable SLMs are feasible for AWebGIS, offering privacy and scalability benefits.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning improves LLM reasoning in ideal settings but fails in non-ideal scenarios like summary inference, noise suppression, and contextual filtering, revealing critical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve LLM reasoning in realistic, non-ideal scenarios, inspired by human reasoning under imperfect inputs.

Method: Fine-tuned three LLMs and an LVLM using RL (policy-gradient algorithm) and tested on eight datasets under three non-ideal scenarios.

Result: RL improves reasoning in ideal settings but performance drops significantly in non-ideal scenarios, with proposed remediation methods largely ineffective.

Conclusion: Current LLM reasoning capabilities are overstated; non-ideal scenario evaluation is crucial for realistic assessment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

TL;DR: HealthFlow is a self-evolving AI agent for healthcare that outperforms static AI by refining its strategic planning through meta-level evolution, validated on the new EHRFlowBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents in healthcare rely on static strategies, limiting their ability to improve strategic planning, which is vital for complex domains like healthcare.

Method: HealthFlow uses a meta-level evolution mechanism to autonomously refine high-level problem-solving policies by learning from successes and failures, and introduces EHRFlowBench for evaluation.

Result: HealthFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI frameworks, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-evolving strategies.

Conclusion: The work shifts focus from tool-users to self-evolving task-managers, advancing autonomous AI for scientific discovery in healthcare.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A game-theoretic framework (Docking Game) with LoopPlay algorithm improves ligand docking accuracy by 10% over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task learning models perform poorly in ligand docking due to structural complexities, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Proposes a two-player game (ligand and protein players) solved by LoopPlay, alternating training in outer and inner loops for mutual adaptation.

Result: LoopPlay achieves ~10% better binding mode prediction on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances molecular docking accuracy, benefiting drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for integrating urban spatial data but struggle with macro-scale spatial reasoning. A review-and-refine method improves accuracy, positioning LLMs as a flexible alternative to rule-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based and machine learning methods for spatial data integration are limited. LLMs offer a potential solution by leveraging human-like reasoning.

Method: Investigated LLMs' spatial reasoning and adapted a review-and-refine method to correct errors.

Result: LLMs perform well with relevant features but struggle with macro-scale reasoning. The review-and-refine method effectively improves accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising alternative for spatial data integration, with future research needed for post-training and multi-modal methods.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

TL;DR: CogniWeb integrates offline imitation learning and online exploration for web navigation, inspired by human dual-process cognition, achieving competitive performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web navigation is complex for AGI, requiring integration of offline and online learning paradigms, which current methods lack.

Method: Derives a dual-process framework (System 1 for fast intuitive actions, System 2 for deliberate planning) and implements it in CogniWeb, a modular agent.

Result: CogniWeb achieves a 43.96% success rate on WebArena with 75% reduced token usage.

Conclusion: The dual-process framework effectively bridges offline and online learning, enhancing web agent performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient updates of outdated or incorrect medical knowledge in MLLMs without full retraining, given the lack of systematic benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing.

Method: Built on a medical visual QA dataset, MedMKEB includes tasks like counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, and adversarial robustness, validated by human experts.

Result: Experiments reveal limitations in current knowledge editing approaches for medical MLLMs, emphasizing the need for specialized strategies.

Conclusion: MedMKEB aims to standardize and advance trustworthy medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

TL;DR: EasySize is a lightweight gate sizing framework using a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, achieving universal applicability and outperforming existing methods with reduced resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog circuit design is time-consuming and lacks universal, efficient gate sizing methods. Existing AI approaches are resource-heavy and not portable across technology nodes.

Method: Combines finetuned Qwen3-8B with dynamic task-specific loss functions and heuristic search (DE and PSO) in a feedback-enhanced flow.

Result: Performs well across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm nodes without additional training, outperforming AutoCkt in 86.67% of tasks with 96.67% resource reduction.

Conclusion: EasySize reduces reliance on human expertise and computational resources, simplifying analog circuit design, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a Socratic AI Tutor's effectiveness in fostering critical thinking among students, proposing a shift towards multi-agent systems in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how generative AI can enhance metacognitive engagement and counter de-skilling narratives in higher education.

Method: A controlled experiment with 65 pre-service teachers comparing a Socratic AI Tutor to an uninstructed chatbot.

Result: Students using the Socratic Tutor showed greater support for critical and reflective thinking.

Conclusion: The study advocates for orchestrated multi-agent systems in education, offering a roadmap for human-AI co-agency.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model to reconstruct missing event attributes in Process Mining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event logs often contain missing data, and existing methods either rely on process models or simpler ML/DL models, which may not fully capture complex trace structures.

Method: Develops an HGNN model to handle incomplete events by leveraging graph-based representations, evaluated on synthetic and real logs.

Result: The HGNN model shows superior performance in reconstructing all event attributes compared to autoencoder-based approaches.

Conclusion: HGNNs offer a more expressive and effective solution for trace reconstruction in Process Mining.

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Motivation: Existing RAG methods lack multimodal retrieval, limiting complex query handling.

Method: QA-Dragon uses domain and search routers for dynamic, hybrid text-image retrieval.

Result: Achieves 5.06%-6.35% accuracy gains over baselines in various VQA tasks.

Conclusion: QA-Dragon effectively addresses complex VQA by integrating multimodal retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

TL;DR: A framework combining RDF graph databases and LLMs improves expert identification and communication in large-scale maintenance organizations by processing natural language queries for precise targeting and transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional communication methods struggle with information overload and slow response times in complex organizational structures.

Method: Uses RDF graph databases and LLMs to process natural language queries, supported by a planning-orchestration architecture for transparent reasoning.

Result: Enables intuitive query formulation and explainable results, improving communication efficiency and trust.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses communication challenges in large-scale maintenance organizations.

Abstract: In large-scale maintenance organizations, identifying subject matter experts
and managing communications across complex entities relationships poses
significant challenges -- including information overload and longer response
times -- that traditional communication approaches fail to address effectively.
We propose a novel framework that combines RDF graph databases with LLMs to
process natural language queries for precise audience targeting, while

facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combines decision trees and LLMs for interpretable and robust neuro-symbolic reasoning, showing performance gains on benchmarks like ProofWriter, GSM8k, and ARC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system that leverages the interpretability of symbolic reasoning (decision trees) and the generative power of LLMs for robust and general-purpose reasoning.

Method: Integrates decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a multi-agent framework, with LLMs handling abductive reasoning and planning, and a central orchestrator ensuring consistency.

Result: Achieves +7.2% entailment consistency on ProofWriter, +5.3% accuracy on GSM8k, and +6.0% abstraction accuracy on ARC.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture provides an interpretable, extensible solution for neuro-symbolic reasoning, validated by strong benchmark performance and practical applications.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

*Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes redefining the term 'agent' in AI to address ambiguity, offering a framework with clear requirements and multidimensional characterization to improve research and policy clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in the term 'agent' across AI subfields hinders communication, evaluation, reproducibility, and policy development, necessitating a clearer definition.

Method: Historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns inform a proposed framework with minimum requirements and multidimensional characterization (e.g., interaction, learning, autonomy).

Result: A framework for defining agents is introduced, balancing precision with historical flexibility, alongside recommendations for standardization and adoption.

Conclusion: The proposed redefinition and framework aim to enhance research clarity, reproducibility, and policy effectiveness while respecting the term's multifaceted history.

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NomicLaw is a multi-agent simulation where LLMs collaborate on law-making, revealing their social reasoning and persuasive abilities in legal and ethical dilemmas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent legal and ethical deliberation tasks, which remains understudied.

Method: Structured simulation with LLMs proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals, analyzing voting patterns and strategic language.

Result: LLMs form alliances, betray trust, and adapt rhetoric, showcasing latent social reasoning and persuasive skills.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for designing AI systems for autonomous negotiation and legislation in legal contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StructVRM introduces structured, verifiable rewards for fine-grained feedback in multimodal reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional binary scoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to coarse binary rewards, limiting nuanced learning.

Method: StructVRM uses a model-based verifier for sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence.

Result: Seed-StructVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks and a high-difficulty STEM-Bench.

Conclusion: Structured, verifiable rewards significantly enhance multimodal models' reasoning capabilities in complex domains.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

TL;DR: A real-time predictive maintenance solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems using an online processing pipeline with pre-processing, ML classification, and explainability, achieving high accuracy and F-measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance railway predictive maintenance by enabling real-time fault prediction with explainability, improving service availability and safety.

Method: Proposes an online processing pipeline with sample pre-processing, incremental ML classification, and explainability modules.

Result: Achieves >98% F-measure and 99% accuracy on the MetroPT dataset, handling class imbalance and noise effectively.

Conclusion: The pipeline is methodologically sound and practically applicable for proactive maintenance in railway operations.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

*Xinrun Xu,Pi Bu,Ye Wang,Börje F. Karlsson,Ziming Wang,Tengtao Song,Qi Zhu,Jun Song,Zhiming Ding,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPHY is a benchmark framework to evaluate VLMs' understanding of physical principles, revealing their struggles with precise predictive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack attention to detail and precise action planning in dynamic environments, necessitating a systematic evaluation of their physical reasoning.

Method: DeepPHY uses simulated environments with varying difficulty levels and fine-grained metrics to assess VLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs fail to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise predictive control.

Conclusion: DeepPHY highlights VLMs' limitations in physical reasoning, suggesting a need for improved models.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

TL;DR: LLMs are transforming organic synthesis by proposing routes, predicting outcomes, and automating experiments, aided by integration with other technologies, though challenges like bias and safety remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs are revolutionizing organic chemistry by automating and optimizing synthesis processes, while addressing limitations and ensuring human oversight.

Method: Coupling LLMs with graph neural networks, quantum calculations, and real-time spectroscopy to enhance accuracy and efficiency in chemical discovery.

Result: LLMs accelerate discovery cycles, enable greener chemistry, and support automation, but face issues like biased data and lack of transparency.

Conclusion: Community efforts like open benchmarks and explainable interfaces aim to democratize AI-driven chemistry while maintaining human control for reliable innovation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the geographic variability in AI alignment, emphasizing the need for context-aware approaches due to cultural, political, and legal differences across regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored issue of geographic variability in AI alignment, as current methods often overlook regional differences in norms and realities.

Method: The paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests future work topics, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

Result: The study underscores the urgency of spatio-temporally aware alignment for AI systems, especially as AI increasingly mediates knowledge and representation globally.

Conclusion: The conclusion calls for context-sensitive alignment approaches to ensure AI systems respect regional differences and societal norms.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bench-2-CoP, a framework to address the misalignment between AI benchmarks and regulatory needs, revealing significant gaps in evaluating systemic risks like loss-of-control scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to align AI evaluation practices with emerging regulations (e.g., EU AI Act) due to the inadequacy of current benchmarks in measuring systemic risks.

Method: Developed Bench-2-CoP, a framework using LLM-as-judge analysis to map benchmark questions against the EU AI Act's taxonomy.

Result: Found major gaps: benchmarks focus on narrow behavioral propensities (e.g., hallucination, bias) while neglecting critical functional capabilities (e.g., loss-of-control scenarios).

Conclusion: Highlights the urgent need for policymakers and developers to address evaluation gaps to ensure safer and compliant AI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity and bias in ERC datasets by using a small, efficient LLM to generate diverse datasets, improving ERC classification and analyzing label imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC datasets are scarce and biased, limiting progress in emotion recognition. LLMs are expensive and underutilized for ERC data generation.

Method: A small, resource-efficient LLM is used to synthesize diverse ERC datasets, supplementing three major benchmarks. Six new datasets are created.

Result: Generated datasets improve ERC classifier robustness and performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets effectively address ERC data scarcity and bias, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAlign is a scalable, sample-efficient post-training framework for LLMs, combining SFT and DPO to enhance reasoning with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving LLM reasoning are resource-intensive and lack scalability due to heuristic or task-specific strategies.

Method: InfiAlign integrates SFT and DPO, using a data selection pipeline to curate high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets.

Result: The SFT model matches DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's performance with only 12% of the data, and DPO further improves mathematical reasoning by 3.89% on AIME benchmarks.

Conclusion: InfiAlign offers a scalable, data-efficient solution for aligning large reasoning models, demonstrated by strong generalization and performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAIL enhances retrieval-augmented reasoning for LLMs by integrating graph-structured knowledge, improving accuracy and F1 scores significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with structured knowledge like graphs, leading to information gaps or redundancy.

Method: GRAIL combines LLM-guided exploration, path filtering, and a two-stage training process for dynamic action selection.

Result: Achieves 21.01% accuracy and 22.43% F1 improvement on knowledge graph QA datasets.

Conclusion: GRAIL effectively balances precision and conciseness in graph retrieval, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: A modular framework for evaluating agent task completion is proposed, improving alignment with human evaluations by validating step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for foundation models as agents focus only on final outputs or are domain-specific, lacking generalizability.

Method: The framework decomposes tasks into sub-tasks, validates each step using agent output and reasoning, and aggregates module outputs for a final verdict.

Result: The framework outperforms GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy on GAIA and BigCodeBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential as a general-purpose evaluation tool for agent task completion.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LORI is an AI tool using NLP and large language models (RoBERTa, LLAMA) to assess leadership skills in letters of recommendation for graduate admissions, achieving high accuracy (F1: 91.6%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LORs are time-consuming to review; automating leadership skill assessment can streamline admissions and provide better feedback for applicants.

Method: Uses natural language processing (NLP) with RoBERTa and LLAMA to detect leadership attributes like teamwork, communication, and innovation.

Result: RoBERTa model achieves 91.6% F1 score, 92.4% precision, and 91.6% recall, demonstrating strong consistency.

Conclusion: Integrating LORI into admissions improves efficiency and accuracy in evaluating leadership skills, especially in STEM.

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

### [132] [MV-Debate: Multi-view Agent Debate with Dynamic Reflection Gating for Multimodal Harmful Content Detection in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05557)
*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MV-Debate is a multi-view agent debate framework for detecting harmful content in social media, outperforming existing methods by leveraging diverse interpretive perspectives and dynamic reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media's multimodal nature makes harmful intent detection challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, cultural shifts, and subtle cues.

Method: MV-Debate uses four debate agents (surface analyst, deep reasoner, modality contrast, social contextualist) for iterative debate and reflection under a reflection-gain criterion.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show MV-Debate outperforms single-model and multi-agent debate baselines.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate frameworks like MV-Debate enhance reliable harmful content detection in online safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

### [133] [The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619)
*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active Inference (AIF) is proposed as a solution to the grounded-agency gap in AI, enabling autonomous learning without human reward engineering by minimizing free energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems rely heavily on human-engineered rewards, creating scalability issues. The paper aims to address this by promoting autonomous learning.

Method: Integrate AIF with Large Language Models to replace external rewards with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Result: AIF offers a framework for autonomous agents to learn efficiently while aligning with human values, bridging the grounded-agency gap.

Conclusion: AIF combined with generative world models presents a viable path toward scalable, autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

*Yu Yuan,Lili Zhao,Wei Chen,Guangting Zheng,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LearnerAgent, a multi-agent framework using LLMs, simulates human learning dynamics with psychologically grounded profiles, revealing insights into cognitive growth, behavior patterns, and LLM limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in capturing learning dynamics, tracking progress, and providing explainability in human learning behavior.

Method: Introduces LearnerAgent, a multi-agent framework with psychologically grounded learner profiles (Deep, Surface, Lazy, General) and tracks learning progress through weekly knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, tests, and peer interaction.

Result: 1) Deep Learner shows sustained cognitive growth; Surface Learner's shallow knowledge is diagnosed. 2) Behavior aligns with psychological profiles. 3) Self-concept evolves realistically. 4) Base LLM defaults to a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner."

Conclusion: LearnerAgent effectively simulates real learning scenarios, providing deeper insights into LLM behavior and human-like learning dynamics.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

### [135] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enriching dialogue transcriptions with metadata tags for speaker characteristics using frozen audio and language models, achieving competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue transcriptions by adding speaker metadata (e.g., age, gender, emotion) without fine-tuning models, preserving modularity and speed.

Method: Couples frozen audio foundation models (Whisper, WavLM) with a frozen LLAMA language model, using lightweight connectors to bridge audio and language representations.

Result: Competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks; frozen LLAMA achieves an 8.8% Equal Error Rate in x-vector comparisons.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enriches transcriptions with speaker metadata, leveraging frozen models for efficiency and modularity.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parity-aware BPE improves tokenization fairness for lower-resource languages without sacrificing global compression or downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenization algorithms favor dominant languages, disadvantaging lower-resource languages and amplifying inequalities.

Method: Introduces Parity-aware BPE, which prioritizes compression gain for the worst-compressed language at each merge step.

Result: Achieves more equitable token counts across languages with minimal impact on global compression and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE addresses cross-lingual disparities in tokenization effectively.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

TL;DR: Joint ASR and pitch accent detection model improves ASR performance and pitch accent detection, reducing WER by 28.3% and closing F1-score gap by 41%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR systems by incorporating prosodic cues like pitch accent, improving performance under limited resources.

Method: Introduce a joint model combining ASR and pitch accent detection, leveraging semi-supervised speech representations.

Result: Pitch accent detection improves by 41% in F1-score; ASR WER decreases by 28.3% on LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: Extending pretrained speech models to include prosodic cues like pitch accent is crucial for performance gains.

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

*Tommaso Tosato,Saskia Helbling,Yorguin-Jose Mantilla-Ramos,Mahmood Hegazy,Alberto Tosato,David John Lemay,Irina Rish,Guillaume Dumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERSIST evaluates personality stability in large language models (LLMs), revealing significant variability in responses despite interventions, challenging assumptions about behavioral consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability of personality-like traits in LLMs for safe deployment, given their increasing use in critical applications.

Method: Evaluated 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality instruments, testing variations in prompts, personas, and reasoning modes.

Result: Found substantial response variability (SD > 0.4), prompt reordering shifts measurements by 20%, and interventions like chain-of-thought reasoning increase variability. LLM-adapted instruments show similar instability.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack foundations for genuine behavioral consistency, suggesting personality-based alignment strategies may be inadequate for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router is a dynamic, role-aware context routing framework for multi-agent LLMs, reducing token usage by up to 30% while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coordination schemes in multi-agent LLMs are inefficient due to static or full-context routing, leading to high token consumption and limited adaptability.

Method: Introduces RCR-Router, which dynamically selects relevant memory subsets per agent based on role and task stage, guided by a lightweight scoring policy.

Result: Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show reduced token usage (up to 30%) with maintained or improved answer quality.

Conclusion: Structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation are key for scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating LLMs' responses to linguistic shibboleths reveals biases, particularly against hedging language, with a 25.6% lower rating for hedged responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and measure demographic bias in LLMs through subtle linguistic markers like hedging, which can reveal attributes like gender or social class.

Method: Uses 100 validated question-response pairs in interview simulations to isolate linguistic variations while maintaining semantic equivalence.

Result: Hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, demonstrating systematic bias in LLMs.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a framework for detecting linguistic discrimination in AI, aiding fairness in automated decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [141] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a vision-language clustering framework to address ambiguities in verb semantics for evaluating visual activity recognition systems, showing better alignment with human judgements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard exact-match evaluation fails to capture ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation, leading to incomplete model assessments.

Method: A vision-language clustering framework constructs verb sense clusters for robust evaluation, tested on the imSitu dataset.

Result: Each image maps to 2.8 sense clusters on average, representing distinct perspectives. Cluster-based evaluation aligns better with human judgements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more nuanced and accurate assessment of model performance compared to standard methods.

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM framework improves extraction of social determinants of health (SDoH) factors from unstructured text, outperforming state-of-the-art models and enhancing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data-driven SDoH factor extraction for suicide prevention, including long-tailed distributions, pivotal stressors, and model explainability.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage LLM framework, comparing it to BioBERT, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek-R1, and evaluates its impact on annotation speed and accuracy.

Result: Framework boosts SDoH extraction performance, achieves comparable/better results with lower costs, and improves explainability via intermediate explanations.

Conclusion: Enhances accuracy and transparency in SDoH extraction, aiding early risk identification and suicide prevention strategies.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for DiaASQ by partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization, followed by a two-step quadruple extraction framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume uniform sentiment distribution across dialogues, but dialogues often contain independent sub-dialogues, introducing noise.

Method: Partition dialogues using structural entropy minimization, then extract sentiment elements at utterance level and match quadruples at sub-dialogue level.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses noise and improves efficiency in DiaASQ.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning decoder-only LLMs like LLaMA 3.2 achieves comparable AMR parsing performance to SOTA methods, with LLaMA 3.2 excelling semantically and Phi 3.5 structurally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a straightforward finetuning approach for AMR parsing using decoder-only LLMs, avoiding complex architectures.

Method: Finetuned four LLMs (Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, DeepSeek R1) on the LDC2020T02 AMR3.0 test set and evaluated their performance.

Result: LLaMA 3.2 achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804, matching IBM's APT + Silver and nearing MBSE's Graphene Smatch (0.854). Phi 3.5 led in structural validity.

Conclusion: Decoder-only LLMs, especially LLaMA 3.2, offer a simple yet effective alternative to complex SOTA AMR parsers.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simplified multi-head LoRA outperforms complex multi-adapter systems, and a single-adapter LoRA with increased rank is competitive. Align-LoRA, with explicit task alignment, surpasses baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the need for structural diversity in multi-task learning (MTL) for LLMs, proposing simpler, more effective methods.

Method: Compare multi-head and single-adapter LoRA variants, then introduce Align-LoRA with a loss for task representation alignment.

Result: Simplified architectures outperform complex ones; Align-LoRA achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: Effective MTL relies on shared representations, not task isolation. Align-LoRA offers a simpler, better paradigm.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [147] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEE-RAG, a framework to address entropy growth and attention dilution in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by ensuring entropy invariance and balanced attention dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face knowledge limitations, and RAG's long context lengths lead to unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution, harming performance.

Method: Proposes BEE-RAG, leveraging entropy invariance to balance context entropy and reformulate attention dynamics, with zero-shot inference and adaptive fine-tuning.

Result: BEE-RAG improves RAG performance across tasks by stabilizing entropy and separating attention sensitivity from context length.

Conclusion: BEE-RAG effectively addresses entropy and attention issues in RAG, enhancing adaptability and performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit positional bias, favoring start/end of sequences (attention basin). AttnRank reranks inputs to align critical info with high-attention positions, boosting performance without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate positional bias in LLMs, enhancing their performance by optimizing input structure.

Method: Introduces AttnRank, a two-stage framework: (1) calibrates positional attention preferences, (2) reranks inputs to align critical info with high-attention positions.

Result: AttnRank improves performance across 10 LLMs in multi-hop QA and few-shot tasks without modifying models.

Conclusion: Positional bias in LLMs can be leveraged via AttnRank to enhance performance efficiently and model-agnostically.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ethical reasoning in healthcare, revealing gaps in practical application and alignment with medical ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook ethical reasoning in LLMs for healthcare, necessitating a rigorous evaluation tool.

Method: Developed PrinciplismQA with 3,648 questions (multiple-choice and open-ended) from authoritative sources, validated by experts.

Result: LLMs show gaps in practical ethical application, especially in Beneficence. Closed-source models lead, but medical fine-tuning helps.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA identifies ethical weaknesses, aiding the development of responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MulCoT-RD, a lightweight model for joint multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification (JMSRC), using a 'Teacher-Assistant-Student' distillation approach to achieve strong performance with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on heavy multimodal LLMs, ignoring resource-constrained environments. The paper addresses this gap by focusing on lightweight solutions for autonomous sentiment reasoning and classification.

Method: Proposes MulCoT-RD, a distillation model with a 'Teacher-Assistant-Student' paradigm. It uses a high-performance MLLM to generate reasoning data, trains an assistant model, and then a lightweight student model for efficient reasoning and classification.

Result: MulCoT-RD achieves strong performance on JMSRC with only 3B parameters, showing robust generalization and interpretability across four datasets.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates a resource-efficient solution for multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification, balancing performance and deployment constraints.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured pruning method for LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks, inspired by neural networks in the human brain, to improve pruning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods disrupt LLM functionalities by ignoring neuron interactions. The study aims to preserve these interactions for better performance.

Method: Treats LLMs as digital brains, decomposes them into functional networks, and prunes by preserving key neurons within these networks.

Result: Successfully identifies functional networks and key neurons, enabling efficient pruning.

Conclusion: The method enhances pruning by preserving functional architecture, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeBoost is a post-training framework for code LLMs that enhances performance using code snippets without human-annotated instructions, leveraging techniques like maximum-clique curation and bi-directional prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code LLMs rely on labor-intensive human-annotated instructions, while code snippets are abundant but underutilized. CodeBoost addresses this imbalance.

Method: CodeBoost uses maximum-clique curation, bi-directional prediction, error-aware prediction, heterogeneous augmentation, and heterogeneous rewarding to train models from code snippets.

Result: Experiments show CodeBoost consistently improves performance across multiple code LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeBoost provides a scalable and effective training pipeline for code LLMs without needing human-annotated instructions.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [154] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the 'cascading failure' hypothesis in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, revealing 'Late-Stage Fragility'—errors in later reasoning stages harm final answers more. It introduces ASCoT, an adaptive self-correction method, improving accuracy over standard CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of reasoning chains in LLMs, particularly the overlooked vulnerability of late-stage errors ('Late-Stage Fragility').

Method: Introduces ASCoT with an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) and Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). AVM uses a Positional Impact Score to prioritize late-stage corrections, while MSCE applies dual-path corrections.

Result: ASCoT outperforms baselines (including standard CoT) on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH, demonstrating higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction in LLM reasoning, moving beyond uniform verification strategies.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper explores using dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers, addressing data scarcity with synthetic LLM-generated data and demonstrating improved performance over standard LLM assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing is a decision-making process requiring argument evaluation, but prior work treated it as summarization. Dialogue agents can assist, but data scarcity is a challenge.

Method: Generate synthetic data using LLMs via self-refinement, train dialogue agents on this data, and evaluate in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios.

Result: The method produces high-quality synthetic data and outperforms off-the-shelf LLM assistants, enhancing meta-reviewing efficiency.

Conclusion: Dialogue agents trained on synthetic LLM-generated data effectively assist meta-reviewers, improving the meta-reviewing process.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the Large Concept Model (LCM) by eliminating its diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal while retaining semantic abstraction.

Method: SONAR-LLM is trained with a hybrid objective: it uses token-level cross-entropy propagated via a frozen SONAR decoder, operating in the same continuous SONAR embedding space as LCM.

Result: SONAR-LLM achieves competitive generation quality across model sizes (39M to 1.3B parameters) and includes scaling trends, ablations, and benchmark results.

Conclusion: The paper presents SONAR-LLM as a viable alternative to LCM, releasing training code and pretrained checkpoints to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGRS reduces overthinking in LRLMs by suppressing reflection triggers when confidence is high, cutting token usage by 18.5%-41.9% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overthinking in LRLMs leads to redundant reasoning steps, increasing costs and reducing utility.

Method: CGRS dynamically suppresses reflection triggers during high-confidence responses, requiring no retraining.

Result: Reduces token usage significantly (18.5%-41.9%) while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: CGRS offers a practical, model-agnostic solution for efficient reasoning in LRLMs.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of adjustable features in a sign language avatar on Hololens 2, finding no significant UX or comprehensibility improvements despite user preference for adjustability. Key issues include missing SL elements and poor implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how adjustable features in a sign language avatar affect user experience, comprehensibility, and acceptability among expert German Sign Language users.

Method: Analysis of interactions with adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a specific use case, evaluating UX, comprehensibility, and acceptability.

Result: No significant UX or comprehensibility improvements; higher stress for adjustable avatar. Hedonic quality rated higher than pragmatic quality. Adjustability acceptability depended on usability and animation quality.

Conclusion: Personalisation alone is insufficient; SL avatars must be comprehensible by default. Recommendations include improving mouthing, facial animation, interaction interfaces, and using participatory design.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional search tasks, such as biomedical research, require high expertise and transparency, but automated systems may misalign with expert needs. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge serves as a testbed.

Method: The study evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs (e.g., Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini) with a self-feedback mechanism for query expansion and answer refinement across multiple answer types.

Result: Preliminary results show varied performance of the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLM self-correction and sets the stage for comparing LLM-generated feedback with human expert input in professional search systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMEval-3 is a dynamic evaluation framework for LLMs, addressing data contamination and overfitting by using a proprietary question bank, automated integrity checks, and calibrated scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks for LLMs are prone to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, masking true model capabilities.

Method: LLMEval-3 dynamically samples 220k graduate-level questions, employs contamination-resistant curation, anti-cheating measures, and an LLM-as-a-judge process with 90% human agreement.

Result: A 20-month study of 50 models revealed performance ceilings on memorization and exposed contamination issues, with robust ranking stability.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 provides a credible, dynamic evaluation paradigm for assessing true LLM capabilities, advancing trustworthy evaluation standards.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

*Chenzhuo Zhao,Xinda Wang,Yue Huang,Junting Lu,Ziqian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASE is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' token-level and structural reasoning across languages, revealing their limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding, which is crucial for precision-demanding applications.

Method: TASE includes 10 tasks (token awareness, structural understanding) in Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set and synthetic data generation. Models like O3, Claude 4, and a custom Qwen2.5-14B were evaluated.

Result: Human performance significantly surpasses LLMs, highlighting weaknesses in token-level reasoning.

Conclusion: TASE identifies LLM limitations and provides a diagnostic tool for improving low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare and analyze existing creativity measures across diverse creative domains to understand their effectiveness and limitations.

Method: Examination and comparison of four creativity metrics (creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, LLM-as-a-Judge) in creative writing, problem-solving, and research ideation.

Result: Metrics show limited consistency, each capturing different aspects of creativity. Key limitations include lexical focus, model sensitivity, lack of conceptual capture, and bias.

Conclusion: Current creativity measures are inconsistent and flawed, necessitating more robust and generalizable evaluation frameworks aligned with human judgments.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

### [165] [LAG: Logic-Augmented Generation from a Cartesian Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05509)
*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a method to improve LLMs' reasoning by decomposing questions into logical sub-questions and resolving them sequentially, reducing hallucinations and enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks and hallucinations, and RAG lacks structured reasoning. LAG aims to address these gaps by incorporating systematic logic.

Method: LAG decomposes questions into atomic sub-questions, resolves them sequentially with dependency-aware reasoning, and uses a termination mechanism to halt unanswerable queries.

Result: LAG outperforms RAG, reducing hallucinations and improving reasoning robustness on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LAG offers a principled, logic-driven alternative to RAG, aligning LLM problem-solving with human cognition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates implicit biases in LLMs using the 20 Questions game, revealing geographic disparities in performance, favoring the Global North and West, with minimal impact from language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover subtle implicit biases in LLMs that persist despite efforts to mitigate explicit biases, using a proactive questioning approach.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs using the 20 Questions game (canonical and unlimited turns) in seven languages, with a new dataset (Geo20Q+) of notable entities from diverse regions.

Result: LLMs perform better for entities from the Global North and West; Wikipedia pageviews and corpus frequency don't fully explain disparities. Language has little impact on gaps.

Conclusion: Creative evaluation frameworks like 20 Questions reveal hidden biases in LLMs, highlighting geographic and cultural disparities in reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex improves legal text generation by dynamically copying from context based on model confidence, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in legal domains face issues with unfaithful outputs; existing solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation lack guaranteed context integration.

Method: Introduces CoCoLex, a decoding strategy that blends model vocabulary with context-derived copying, guided by confidence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five legal benchmarks, especially in long-form tasks.

Conclusion: CoCoLex ensures higher fidelity to source context, advancing legal text generation.

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A frequency-based uncertainty quantification method is proposed for LLMs in MCQA, using conformal prediction to ensure reliability and outperforming logit-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of LLMs (e.g., hallucination, overconfidence) in high-risk MCQA applications.

Method: Frequency-based uncertainty quantification via multiple independent samplings and predictive entropy calculation under black-box settings.

Result: Outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing correct/incorrect predictions (AUROC) and controls miscoverage rates effectively.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable, model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification in MCQA, enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether political opinions differ across languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs) and finds minimal cross-lingual differences. Political alignment shifts opinions uniformly across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if cross-cultural political opinion differences in surveys translate to cross-lingual differences in MLLMs.

Method: Analyzed MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages by prompting them to report agreement with political statements. Evaluated models before and after political alignment using direct preference optimization.

Result: Unaligned models show few significant cross-lingual differences. Political alignment shifts opinions uniformly across languages.

Conclusion: Political opinions transfer between languages in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in achieving socio-linguistic and political alignment.

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith is a framework for synthesizing challenging math problems to enhance LLM reasoning, outperforming baselines by generating diverse, high-difficulty data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data for LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Constructs new problems from scratch using PlanetMath, employs reinforcement learning, and optimizes for difficulty and validity.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME2024, AIME2025, and OlympiadBench.

Conclusion: MathSmith demonstrates scalability and effectiveness in advancing LLM reasoning through synthetic data.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooper, a RL framework that jointly optimizes policy and reward models to address limitations of rule-based and model-based rewards, improving robustness and mitigating reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward paradigms (rule-based and model-based) for LLMs in reasoning tasks have limitations: rule-based lacks robustness, and model-based is prone to reward hacking.

Method: Proposes Cooper, which co-optimizes policy and reward models, leveraging rule-based precision and dynamic sample selection. Introduces a hybrid annotation strategy and reference-based reward modeling (VerifyRM).

Result: Cooper improves robustness, mitigates reward hacking, and enhances RL performance (e.g., 0.54% accuracy gain on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct). VerifyRM outperforms same-size models on VerifyBench.

Conclusion: Dynamically updating reward models effectively combats reward hacking, offering a better integration of reward models into RL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEAR evaluates language models' embodied reasoning in dynamic tasks, revealing performance drops in tool usage and multi-agent coordination, highlighting limitations despite fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark language models' capabilities in embodied reasoning, focusing on physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination.

Method: OmniEAR uses text-based environment representation to model 1,500 scenarios, testing dynamic capability acquisition and autonomous coordination.

Result: Performance drops significantly for tool reasoning (56-85%) and implicit collaboration (63-85%), with fine-tuning improving single-agent tasks but not multi-agent tasks.

Conclusion: Embodied reasoning presents unique challenges beyond current models' capabilities, establishing OmniEAR as a benchmark for advancing embodied AI.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) by proposing a novel reward function for online Reinforcement Learning (RL) that improves factuality, detail, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R-LLMs struggle with factuality, especially in long-form tasks, and existing methods like offline RL with automatic evaluation frameworks lead to reward hacking.

Method: A new reward function is introduced for online RL, balancing factual precision, detail level, and relevance.

Result: The model reduces hallucinations by 23.1 percentage points, increases detail by 23%, and maintains response helpfulness.

Conclusion: The proposed reward function effectively enhances factual reasoning in R-LLMs without compromising other qualities.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes analyze persuasion in LLM-human conversations, outperforming prompting in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in LLMs using lightweight probes, inspired by cognitive science.

Method: Apply linear probes to study persuasion success, personality, and strategy in multi-turn conversations.

Result: Probes effectively capture persuasion aspects, identifying key moments and outperforming prompting in strategy analysis.

Conclusion: Probes offer a scalable, efficient method for studying complex behaviors like deception in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H-NET++ is a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model for byte-level language models, improving performance in morphologically-rich languages like Persian by addressing computational challenges and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level models face inefficiencies in morphologically-rich languages due to long byte sequences per word. H-NET++ aims to provide a linguistically-informed, tokenizer-free solution.

Method: H-NET++ uses a lightweight Transformer for cross-chunk attention, a two-level latent hyper-prior for consistency, handles orthographic artifacts, and employs curriculum-based training.

Result: Achieves 0.159 BPB reduction vs. BPE-based GPT-2-fa, 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on morphological boundaries.

Conclusion: H-NET++ demonstrates that hierarchical dynamic chunking is an effective, unsupervised solution for morphologically-rich languages, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: NAEx is a model-agnostic framework for explaining network alignment decisions by identifying influential subgraphs and features, ensuring interpretability and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited interpretability of network alignment models hinders trust, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: NAEx jointly parameterizes graph structures and feature spaces using learnable masks and optimizes for faithful explanations.

Result: NAEx effectively explains alignment decisions and integrates with four NA models, demonstrating efficiency on benchmarks.

Conclusion: NAEx enhances interpretability and trust in network alignment models through inductive, efficient explanations.

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

TL;DR: LumiGen is an LVLM-enhanced framework for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, improving fine-grained control and semantic consistency through iterative feedback and prompt augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with complex instructions, fine-grained control, and semantic consistency, while LVLMs excel in cross-modal understanding.

Method: LumiGen uses an Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module for closed-loop optimization.

Result: LumiGen achieves a superior score of 3.08 on LongBench-T2I, excelling in text rendering and pose expression.

Conclusion: LVLM integration in LumiGen enhances controllability and quality in T2I generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

*Nan Li,Wanting Yang,Marie Siew,Zehui Xiong,Binbin Chen,Shiwen Mao,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated aggregation framework is proposed to address the computational and privacy challenges of diffusion models in edge-AIGC scenarios, enhancing personalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of cloud-based solutions for diffusion models, such as privacy risks, inefficiency in personalization, and high communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC settings.

Method: The method involves clustering clients based on task similarity, intra-cluster aggregation for personalization, and inter-cluster knowledge interaction. It uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning and federated learning for collaborative training.

Result: The framework achieves accelerated convergence and maintains practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC services under edge constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap in edge-AIGC by balancing efficiency, personalization, and privacy, making it suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM) for Few-shot Learning (FSL), outperforming meta-learning methods, and presents a dataset (M3FD) and framework (M3F) to support diverse scientific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSL is vital in data-scarce fields like biomedical and environmental sciences, where data collection is costly or constrained. The study aims to improve FSL generalization using multi-modal models.

Method: The authors developed M3FD, a diverse few-shot dataset, and M3F, a modular LMMM framework. The model is fine-tuned on M3FD to enhance performance.

Result: M3F outperforms conventional meta-learning methods, demonstrating improved generalization for FSL tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable solution for FSL in data-scarce domains, with open-source tools to promote accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol is an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs for molecular property prediction rely on human-crafted prompts and verbose reasoning, lacking relevance.

Method: AttriLens-Mol uses three rewards: format, count, and rationality, to guide LLM reasoning and elicit relevant molecular attributes.

Result: The method significantly boosts performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, outperforming supervised fine-tuning and advanced models.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits predictive molecular attributes, enhancing interpretability and performance for property prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

### [182] [PA-RNet: Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04750)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PA-RNet is a robust multimodal forecasting framework that addresses textual noise in time series data using perturbation-aware projection and cross-modal attention, improving generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual noise in multimodal time series data degrades model performance, but existing methods overlook this issue.

Method: PA-RNet uses a perturbation-aware projection module and cross-modal attention to filter noise while preserving meaningful textual embeddings.

Result: PA-RNet outperforms baselines, reduces prediction error, and maintains stability under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: PA-RNet effectively handles textual noise, enhancing robustness in multimodal time series forecasting.

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [183] [InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753)
*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ is a training-free framework for mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) that measures layer sensitivity by mutual information changes, enabling efficient bit-width allocation via integer linear programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MPQ methods rely on costly search algorithms or local proxies like the Hessian, which miss global quantization effects. InfoQ addresses this by focusing on layer impact on network-wide information flow.

Method: InfoQ quantizes layers at different bit-widths, measures mutual information changes in subsequent layers via a single forward pass, and formulates bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem.

Result: InfoQ achieves superior search-time/accuracy trade-off (using 100x less data than LIMPQ) and improves accuracy by up to 1% for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates.

Conclusion: InfoQ offers an efficient, training-free solution for MPQ, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

### [184] [Are Large Language Models Dynamic Treatment Planners? An In Silico Study from a Prior Knowledge Injection Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04755)
*Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show promise in clinical DTRs, matching or outperforming trained RL agents in stable cases, but exhibit critical limitations like aggressive dosing and reasoning errors. Hybrid approaches are recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs can automate clinical decision-making in DTRs without extensive training, leveraging their implicit knowledge through prompts.

Method: Compared zero-shot LLM performance (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) against trained small RL agents in a Type 1 diabetes simulator, testing prompts and reasoning.

Result: LLMs matched or outperformed RL agents in stable cohorts but showed flaws like aggressive dosing and reasoning errors. Minimal gains from latent state reasoning.

Conclusion: Cautious LLM integration is advised, emphasizing prompt engineering, validation, and hybrid approaches combining linguistic and physiological modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

### [185] [Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780)
*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPOPR is a predict-then-optimize framework for equitable power restoration, reducing outage duration by 3.60% and inequity by 14.19%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current power restoration methods are inequitable, as disadvantaged communities submit fewer requests, leading to prolonged outages.

Method: EPOPR combines Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for repair prediction and Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL for equitable decision-making.

Result: EPOPR reduces average outage duration by 3.60% and inequity by 14.19% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EPOPR successfully balances efficiency and equity in power restoration, addressing disparities in request submission.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jaehyung Lim,Wonbin Kweon,Woojoo Kim,Junyoung Kim,Seongjin Choi,Dongha Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces F3CRec, a framework combining Federated Learning and Continual Learning for privacy-preserving recommendations in non-stationary data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance privacy and adaptability in recommendation systems with evolving user preferences.

Method: Proposes F3CRec with Adaptive Replay Memory (client-side) and Item-wise Temporal Mean (server-side) to retain and adapt knowledge.

Result: F3CRec outperforms existing methods in maintaining recommendation quality over time in federated settings.

Conclusion: F3CRec successfully bridges the gap between privacy and adaptability in recommendation systems.

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

### [187] [HCRide: Harmonizing Passenger Fairness and Driver Preference for Human-Centered Ride-Hailing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04811)
*Lin Jiang,Yu Yang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCRide is a human-centered ride-hailing system using multi-agent reinforcement learning (Habic) to balance efficiency, passenger fairness, and driver preference, outperforming baselines in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ride-hailing systems prioritize operator revenue, often neglecting passenger fairness and driver preference, leading to poor experiences.

Method: HCRide employs Habic, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with a competition mechanism, dynamic Actor network, and Bi-Critic network.

Result: HCRide improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% in Shenzhen and NYC datasets.

Conclusion: HCRide successfully balances efficiency, fairness, and driver preference, offering a more human-centered approach to ride-hailing.

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

*Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified flow matching framework for marked temporal point processes is proposed, enabling non-autoregressive joint modeling of inter-event times and event types, outperforming autoregressive and diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive models for marked event sequences are inefficient and prone to error accumulation in long-range forecasting.

Method: The framework uses continuous and discrete flow matching to jointly model inter-event times and event types, avoiding sequential decoding.

Result: The model shows significant improvements in accuracy and generation efficiency on six real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of autoregressive models for long horizon event sequence modeling.

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

TL;DR: A multi-stage intrusion detection framework for CAN protocol combines unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning to improve security, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CAN protocol lacks built-in security, making it vulnerable to cyber-attacks, necessitating robust intrusion detection methods.

Method: The framework uses a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for anomaly detection and a Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for attack classification, modeling CAN traffic as graph sequences.

Result: The system achieves 96% parameter reduction and 16.2% average F1-score improvement over existing methods, excelling on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances CAN security with high performance and efficiency, particularly in handling imbalanced data.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first quantitative error bounds for OPTQ (GPTQ) and Qronos, explaining their empirical performance and guiding practical design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite OPTQ's widespread use in post-training quantization (PTQ) for deep neural networks, it lacks rigorous theoretical guarantees. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors analyze OPTQ's iterative procedure, derive 2-norm error bounds, and extend the analysis to Qronos, including deterministic and stochastic variants.

Result: Non-asymptotic error bounds are derived, justifying practical heuristics like feature ordering by norm and guiding parameter selection. Stronger infinity-norm bounds are shown for stochastic OPTQ.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis supports OPTQ and Qronos' empirical success, offering insights for improving PTQ algorithms and their practical implementation.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

### [191] [Agnostics: Learning to Code in Any Programming Language via Reinforcement with a Universal Learning Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04865)
*Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki,Yangtian Zi,Zixuan Wu,Tejas Oberoi,Carolyn Jane Anderson,Joydeep Biswas,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agnostics is a language-agnostic post-training pipeline for LLMs that improves performance in low-resource languages by judging code behavior externally, eliminating per-language engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with low-resource languages due to data shortages and the need for language-specific post-training setups.

Method: Agnostics uses an LLM to rewrite unit tests into I/O format, configures a verifier for compilation/execution, and applies RL with verifiable rewards.

Result: Agnostics improves performance in Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and Fortran, rivaling larger models and setting new SOTA results.

Conclusion: The pipeline simplifies RL post-training for any language, with datasets and configurations released for ease of use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

### [192] [Hilbert Neural Operator: Operator Learning in the Analytic Signal Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04882)
*Saman Pordanesh,Pejman Shahsavari,Hossein Ghadjari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO), a novel neural operator architecture that leverages the Hilbert transform to enhance learning for PDE solution operators, addressing limitations of Fourier-based methods like FNO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural operators (e.g., FNO) rely on Fourier transforms, which assume periodicity and overlook other signal properties like phase and amplitude. HNO aims to overcome these limitations by incorporating insights from signal processing.

Method: HNO maps input signals to their analytic representation via the Hilbert transform, making phase and amplitude explicit. It then applies spectral convolution to this representation, leveraging analytic signal theory.

Result: HNO is hypothesized to outperform existing methods for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary systems by better capturing signal dynamics.

Conclusion: HNO offers a promising alternative to Fourier-based neural operators, with potential advantages in modeling complex systems due to its signal-processing-inspired design.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

### [193] [Gaussian mixture layers for neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04883)
*Sinho Chewi,Philippe Rigollet,Yuling Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores implementing dynamics directly over probability measures in neural networks using Gaussian mixture models and Wasserstein gradient flows, introducing a new Gaussian mixture (GM) layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures, advancing beyond the mean-field theory for neural networks.

Method: Uses Gaussian mixture models and Wasserstein gradient flows to derive training dynamics, introducing GM layers into neural network architectures.

Result: GM layers achieve comparable test performance to two-layer fully connected networks and exhibit distinct behavior even in the mean-field regime.

Conclusion: The GM layer offers a novel approach with potential advantages over traditional layers, validated through experiments.

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

*Kelsey Doerksen,Yuliya Marchetti,Steven Lu,Kevin Bowman,James Montgomery,Kazuyuki Miyazaki,Yarin Gal,Freddie Kalaitzis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture to predict surface ozone residuals, addressing limitations of traditional models and improving interpretability for policy and health decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution, particularly surface ozone, poses global health risks, but existing models lack accuracy and interpretability for practical use.

Method: An uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture with Bayesian and quantile regression methods is used to predict ozone residuals from the MOMO-Chem model.

Result: The method effectively estimates regional ozone bias in North America and Europe, evaluates uncertainty, and identifies optimal ground stations for bias correction.

Conclusion: The approach enhances interpretability and decision-making for pollution mitigation, with land-use information playing a key role in modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

*Kelsey Doerksen,Yuliya Marchetti,Kevin Bowman,Steven Lu,James Montgomery,Yarin Gal,Freddie Kalaitzis,Kazuyuki Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 2D CNN-based method improves surface ozone modeling by estimating model bias, outperforming traditional ML and incorporating satellite data for better urban-scale insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution, especially surface ozone, is a major health risk, but current models struggle at human-relevant scales, limiting policy use.

Method: A 2D CNN architecture estimates ozone model bias from MOMO-Chem residuals, tested in North America and Europe, with added satellite land-use data.

Result: The CNN outperforms traditional ML in capturing model residuals and benefits from high-resolution satellite data.

Conclusion: The approach enhances understanding of ozone bias at urban scales, aiding environmental policy improvements.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

*Rahuul Rangaraj,Jimeng Shi,Rajendra Paudel,Giri Narasimhan,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) for water level forecasting in hydrology, improving accuracy by leveraging historical data without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate water level forecasting is vital for ecosystem management, but existing deep learning models struggle with generalization and adaptation in hydrology.

Method: Proposes RAF, a framework that retrieves historically analogous hydrological episodes to enrich model input, using similarity-based and mutual information-based methods.

Result: RAF significantly improves forecasting accuracy on Everglades data, demonstrating its potential for environmental hydrology.

Conclusion: RAF shows promise for adaptive AI in hydrology, enabling better ecosystem management without task-specific retraining.

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

*Jovana Kljajic,John M. O'Toole,Robert Hogan,Tamara Skoric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates performance metrics for neonatal seizure detection models, proposing best practices to address biases and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating neonatal seizure detection models are inconsistent and biased, leading to unreliable AI performance claims.

Method: The study assesses standard metrics, consensus strategies, and human-expert equivalence tests using real and synthetic seizure annotations under varying conditions.

Result: Matthews and Pearson's correlation coefficients performed best under class imbalance, and the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k effectively captured expert-level AI performance.

Conclusion: The study recommends reporting balanced metrics, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and multi-rater Turing test results for reliable model evaluation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

### [198] [Sensitivity of Stability: Theoretical & Empirical Analysis of Replicability for Adaptive Data Selection in Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04901)
*Prabhav Singh,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes replicability in transfer learning, introducing a measure called selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$) to quantify the trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and consistency. It shows that replicability failure increases with sensitivity and decreases with sample size, validated through experiments on the MultiNLI corpus. Highly adaptive strategies perform better but are less replicable, while source domain pretraining mitigates this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the reliability of transfer learning adaptations, especially with adaptive data selection strategies, which lack comprehensive analysis.

Method: Introduces a mathematical framework for replicability, formalizing selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$). Conducts theoretical analysis and empirical validation using the MultiNLI corpus with six adaptive selection strategies.

Result: Highly adaptive strategies (e.g., gradient-based) achieve better performance but have high replicability failure rates (above 7%). Less adaptive strategies maintain lower failure rates. Source domain pretraining reduces failure rates by up to 30%.

Conclusion: The study provides guidelines for balancing performance and replicability in transfer learning, emphasizing the need for replicability-aware system design.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer-based models for hate speech detection, achieving high performance with fine-tuned ELECTRA on the MetaHate dataset, while identifying challenges like sarcasm and coded language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech on social media has serious real-world impacts, necessitating robust automated detection methods.

Method: Evaluated transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, ELECTRA) on the MetaHate dataset (1.2M samples).

Result: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieved the highest F1 score (0.8980).

Conclusion: Transformers are effective for hate speech detection, but challenges like sarcasm and label noise remain.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALScope is a new Deep Active Learning (DAL) platform for classification tasks, integrating diverse datasets and algorithms to enable fair evaluation under varied conditions like distribution shifts and data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified platform for evaluating DAL algorithms under diverse conditions (e.g., distribution shifts, data imbalance) prompted the development of ALScope.

Method: ALScope integrates 10 datasets from CV and NLP, and 21 DAL algorithms, supporting flexible configuration of experimental factors like OOD ratio and class imbalance.

Result: Experiments show DAL performance varies by domain and setting, with room for improvement in non-standard scenarios and trade-offs in selection time.

Conclusion: ALScope facilitates comprehensive DAL evaluation, highlighting performance variability and the need for further research in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

*Nameer Hirschkind,Joseph Liu,Mahesh Kumar Nandwana,Xiao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REINA, a novel loss function for Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems to optimize the tradeoff between translation quality and latency by waiting for more input only when it provides additional information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SimulST systems struggle with balancing translation quality and latency. The goal is to improve this tradeoff by making the system adaptive to incoming information.

Method: The authors propose REINA, a Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation loss, derived from information theory, to train an adaptive policy using a non-streaming translation model.

Result: REINA achieves state-of-the-art results for SimulST models on French, Spanish, and German, improving the latency/quality tradeoff by up to 21% compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: REINA effectively optimizes the latency/quality tradeoff in SimulST systems, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

### [202] [Self-Error Adjustment: Theory and Practice of Balancing Individual Performance and Diversity in Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04948)
*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), a novel ensemble learning framework that decomposes errors into individual performance and diversity terms, enabling precise control over the accuracy-diversity trade-off. SEA outperforms traditional methods like NCL, offering tighter theoretical bounds and better empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting, and NCL lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity trade-off, with NCL suffering from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment range. This motivates the need for a more flexible and theoretically sound framework.

Method: SEA decomposes ensemble errors into individual performance terms (self-error of each learner) and diversity terms (interactions among learners). It introduces an adjustable parameter in the loss function for fine-grained control over these components.

Result: SEA outperforms baseline methods (e.g., NCL) on public regression and classification datasets, offering broader adjustment range and more consistent diversity changes. Theoretical bounds are tighter, and empirical results validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SEA provides a superior framework for ensemble learning, enabling precise control over the accuracy-diversity trade-off with tighter theoretical guarantees and improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two compressed decentralized algorithms for nonconvex stochastic optimization, combining momentum and message-compression techniques to achieve fast convergence and reduced communication costs. Both methods theoretically and empirically outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of nonconvex stochastic optimization in decentralized settings, particularly balancing momentum acceleration, communication compression, and error control.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: (1) a compressed decentralized adaptive method for bounded gradients, and (2) a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method with gradient tracking for data heterogeneity. Both use momentum and compression techniques.

Result: Both algorithms achieve optimal convergence rates, linear speed-up, and topology-independent parameters. They outperform state-of-the-art methods in training DNNs and Transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully integrate momentum and compression, offering efficient solutions for decentralized nonconvex optimization with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR is a transparent and interpretable EEG foundation model using wavelet transforms and Riemannian Manifold Transformer, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models lack transparency and interpretability, hindering clinical integration. MENDR addresses this by leveraging wavelet-based representations and geometric embeddings.

Method: MENDR uses a Riemannian Manifold Transformer to learn symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings from wavelet-decomposed EEG data, pretrained on 4,000+ hours of EEG.

Result: MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance in clinical EEG tasks with fewer parameters and enables accurate EEG signal reconstruction.

Conclusion: MENDR offers an efficient, interpretable, and clinically viable solution for EEG analysis, bridging gaps in transparency and performance.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports

*Kumar Anurag,Kasra Azizi,Francesco Sorrentino,Wenbin Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework, RCUKF, combines reservoir computing and unscented Kalman filtering for accurate modeling of complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of complex systems is challenging, especially where nominal models fail.

Method: Integrates data-driven reservoir computing with Bayesian unscented Kalman filtering for state estimation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on benchmark problems and real-time vehicle trajectory estimation.

Conclusion: RCUKF provides a robust solution for modeling complex systems by combining data-driven and Bayesian approaches.

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

*Menghua Jiang,Yuxia Lin,Baoliang Chen,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMCI, a model using causal theory to address spurious correlations in multimodal sentiment analysis, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSA methods rely on statistical shortcuts, undermining generalization due to spurious correlations.

Method: MMCI models multimodal inputs as a graph, disentangles causal and shortcut features using attention, and applies backdoor adjustment.

Result: Experiments show MMCI suppresses biases and improves performance on standard and OOD datasets.

Conclusion: MMCI effectively addresses spurious correlations, enhancing MSA robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

*Chengsong Huang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Hongming Zhang,Zongxia Li,Ruosen Li,Jiaxin Huang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Zero is a fully autonomous framework for self-evolving LLMs, eliminating reliance on human-curated data by co-evolving Challenger and Solver models to create a self-improving curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM training methods depend on human-curated tasks, limiting progress toward super-intelligence. R-Zero aims to overcome this by enabling autonomous data generation.

Method: R-Zero initializes two models (Challenger and Solver) that co-evolve: the Challenger proposes tasks at the Solver's capability edge, and the Solver solves them, creating a self-improving curriculum.

Result: R-Zero improves reasoning in LLMs, e.g., boosting Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math and +7.54 on general-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Zero demonstrates a scalable, autonomous approach for advancing LLMs beyond human-curated limitations.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

*Dai Do,Manh Nguyen,Svetha Venkatesh,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPaRFT is a self-paced learning framework for LLMs that optimizes data selection and timing, achieving high accuracy with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and heuristic-driven methods lack scalability.

Method: SPaRFT uses cluster-based data reduction and multi-armed bandits to select and allocate training samples efficiently.

Result: SPaRFT matches or outperforms baselines using up to 100x fewer samples.

Conclusion: Performance-driven training curricula can enhance LLM reasoning with minimal resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

*Zhehan Qu,Tianyi Hu,Christian Fronk,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how AR systems can impair situational awareness (SA) during CPR by causing cognitive tunneling. It introduces an AR app for CPR guidance, evaluates SA using eye tracking, and proposes a graph neural network (FixGraphPool) to predict SA with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR systems can enhance task performance but may compromise SA in safety-critical scenarios like CPR. The study aims to understand and mitigate this risk.

Method: Developed an AR app for CPR guidance, conducted a user study with simulated incidents, and used eye tracking to analyze SA. Proposed FixGraphPool, a graph neural network, to predict SA from gaze data.

Result: Higher SA correlated with specific eye movement patterns (e.g., larger saccades, fewer fixations on virtual content). FixGraphPool achieved 83.0% accuracy in predicting SA.

Conclusion: Eye tracking is valuable for SA modeling in AR, and FixGraphPool shows promise for designing safer AR systems that maintain user awareness.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

*Jinhyeok Jang,Jaehong Kim,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KNOW prediction leverages structured forgetting and inversion to create knowledge-enriched pre-trained weights, outperforming traditional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving pre-trained weights to encapsulate more knowledge beyond the given dataset, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Sequential fine-tuning on downsized datasets induces structured forgetting, which is reversed to recover knowledge. Meta-learning (KNOWN) models weight prediction.

Result: KNOW prediction consistently outperforms naive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction, enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: Reinterpreting forgetting dynamics offers a novel way to improve knowledge transfer in deep learning.

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TANGO is a graph representation learning framework using dynamical systems, featuring a learnable Lyapunov function for stable node feature evolution and a tangential component for flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in graph learning like oversquashing and ill-conditioned energy regions by combining energy-based dynamics with tangential evolution.

Method: Uses a Lyapunov function for energy reduction and a tangential component (learned via message passing) to evolve features while maintaining energy.

Result: Achieves strong performance in node and graph classification/regression tasks, mitigating oversquashing.

Conclusion: TANGO effectively combines energy functions and tangential flows for improved graph neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ULU is a non-monotonic, piecewise activation function outperforming ReLU and Mish. Its adaptive variant, AULU, introduces learnable parameters and a new metric (LIB) to measure inductive bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Mish) by proposing a non-monotonic, piecewise function that treats positive and negative inputs differently.

Method: ULU is defined as a piecewise function with distinct behaviors for positive and negative inputs. AULU extends ULU with learnable parameters for adaptive responses. The LIB metric quantifies inductive bias.

Result: ULU significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish in image classification and object detection. AULU further enhances adaptability.

Conclusion: ULU and AULU offer superior performance and adaptability, with LIB providing a quantitative measure of inductive bias.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{ULU}, a novel non-monotonic, piecewise activation function
defined as $\{f(x;\alpha_1),x<0; f(x;\alpha_2),x>=0 \}$, where
$f(x;\alpha)=0.5x(tanh(\alpha x)+1),\alpha >0$. ULU treats positive and
negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU
significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object
detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as
$\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x<0; f(x;\beta_2^2),x>=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for
positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like
Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias
of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal perception impacts sample complexity and optimization in imitation learning, leveraging statistical learning theory.

Method: Analyzes multimodal policies using Rademacher complexity, PAC learning, and information theory, reviewing frameworks like PerAct and CLIPort.

Result: Integrated multimodal policies achieve tighter generalization bounds and better optimization landscapes than unimodal ones.

Conclusion: Multimodal architectures outperform unimodal counterparts due to theoretical advantages in learning frameworks.

Abstract: This paper examines the theoretical foundations of multimodal imitation
learning through the lens of statistical learning theory. We analyze how
multimodal perception (RGB-D, proprioception, language) affects sample
complexity and optimization landscapes in imitation policies. Building on
recent advances in multimodal learning theory, we show that properly integrated
multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more
favorable optimization landscapes than their unimodal counterparts. We provide
a comprehensive review of theoretical frameworks that explain why multimodal
architectures like PerAct and CLIPort achieve superior performance, connecting
these empirical results to fundamental concepts in Rademacher complexity, PAC

*Linxiao Yang,Xinyu Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Integrated Influence, a new data attribution method that addresses limitations of LOO-based methods by incorporating a baseline approach for more reliable and flexible explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data attribution methods, like LOO-based ones, lack collective influence analysis and counterfactual explanations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Integrated Influence, which uses a baseline dataset and a degeneration process to accumulate sample influence, generalizing methods like influence functions.

Result: Integrated Influence outperforms existing methods in data attribution and mislabeled example identification tasks.

Conclusion: The method enhances transparency and reliability in understanding data and model influences, offering a more comprehensive attribution framework.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

*Mojtaba Fayaz-Bakhsh,Danial Ataee,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for cold-start active preference learning uses self-supervised pre-training with PCA and active learning to outperform standard methods, requiring fewer labeled pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the cold-start problem in preference learning, where labeled data is scarce and noisy, especially in social and economic contexts.

Method: Self-supervised pre-training with PCA for initial pseudo-labels, followed by an active learning loop with a simulated noisy oracle.

Result: Outperforms standard active learning, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled pairs across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates the cold-start problem, improving sample efficiency in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

TL;DR: A novel Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework leverages multiple weak supervision signals (similarity-confidence and confidence-difference) for improved performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in accurate labeling and limited labeled data necessitate practical WSL solutions. Existing methods often use single weak supervision, leaving room for improvement.

Method: Proposes SconfConfDiff Classification, integrating two weak labels (similarity-confidence and confidence-difference) for unlabeled data pairs. Introduces two unbiased risk estimators and a risk correction approach.

Result: The method achieves optimal convergence rates, mitigates overfitting, and shows robustness against inaccurate class priors and label noise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in leveraging multiple weak supervision signals.

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training approaches for LLMs fail to develop robust reasoning for function calling, relying on superficial pattern matching or struggling with complex action spaces.

Method: A two-stage data preparation pipeline with iterative LLM evaluation and AST validation, combined with strategic entropy-based exploration in reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 86.02% overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard, outperforming standard GRPO by 6% in complex scenarios, especially benefiting code-pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework enhances structured reasoning and exploration in function calling, offering state-of-the-art performance and potential for broader LLM applications.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFedDG, a hierarchical federated learning approach addressing domain shift, and proposes HFedATM, a method improving model alignment and aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FL and HFL face scalability and domain shift issues, limiting model performance on diverse data distributions.

Method: HFedATM aligns models via Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and aggregates them with Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation.

Result: HFedATM outperforms FedDG baselines, maintains efficiency, and achieves tighter generalization bounds.

Conclusion: HFedATM effectively addresses domain shift in hierarchical FL, enhancing performance and stability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Motivation: To bridge the gap in error-estimation theory for neural-network-based PDE solutions and demonstrate their superior accuracy over traditional numerical methods.

Method: Analysis of deep fully-connected neural networks with general activation functions in Sobolev spaces, measuring errors in $W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$.

Result: Deep networks exhibit super-convergence, surpassing classical methods in approximating weak PDE solutions.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified theoretical foundation for neural networks in scientific computing, closing a significant gap in PDE error-estimation theory.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSEO is a framework for optimizing post-hoc stacking ensembles in AutoML, outperforming existing methods by balancing diversity and performance and adapting to task-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AutoML systems use fixed strategies for ensemble phases, lacking adaptability to task specifics, which PSEO aims to address.

Method: PSEO selects base models via binary quadratic programming, introduces mechanisms for multi-layer stacking, and searches for optimal ensemble strategies.

Result: PSEO achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods on 80 datasets.

Conclusion: PSEO effectively improves ensemble performance in AutoML by optimizing both model selection and stacking strategies.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces domain-driven metrics for evaluating RL-based ABMs and RABMs, addressing challenges like system complexity and lack of standardized metrics. It demonstrates these metrics in a pandemic modeling case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and stochasticity of ABMs and RABMs, along with the absence of standardized metrics, make performance assessment of RL-based models difficult.

Method: Develops domain-driven RL metrics, building on existing ones, and applies them to a rational ABM disease modeling case study (masking, vaccination, lockdown).

Result: Shows the effectiveness of domain-driven rewards combined with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics in various simulation scenarios (e.g., mask availability).

Conclusion: Domain-driven RL metrics enhance the evaluation of RL-based ABMs and RABMs, providing more meaningful insights for complex systems like pandemic modeling.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces pFedDSH, a framework for dynamic client onboarding in Federated Learning, using hypernetworks and data-free replay to maintain performance and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) where existing methods assume static clients, ignoring real-world dynamic onboarding scenarios.

Method: Proposes pFedDSH, leveraging a central hypernetwork with batch-specific masks and data-free replay for knowledge transfer and stability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual Learning baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

Conclusion: pFedDSH effectively balances performance stability for existing clients and adaptation for new clients while optimizing neural resource use.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S$^2$M-Former is a spiking symmetric mixing framework for EEG-based auditory attention detection, offering energy-efficient, high-performance decoding with reduced parameters and power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based AAD lacks synergistic frameworks to fully utilize complementary EEG features under energy constraints.

Method: Introduces a spike-driven symmetric architecture with parallel spatial/frequency branches and lightweight 1D token sequences, reducing parameters and power.

Result: Achieves 5.8× energy reduction, 14.7× parameter reduction, and SOTA accuracy on three AAD benchmarks.

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former is a promising low-power, high-performance solution for AAD tasks.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment) is a tuning-free, black-box-compatible method that balances alignment quality and computational cost by using lightweight prompt optimization, heuristic rewards, and two-stage filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial but often involves costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, creating trade-offs between alignment quality and computational cost. Existing methods ignore this balance.

Method: HIA uses a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference calls while maintaining alignment quality.

Result: HIA outperforms baselines like best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search in multi-objective tasks under the same inference budget. It works well even with low budgets (1-2 queries).

Conclusion: HIA offers a practical, scalable solution for personalized LLM deployment by efficiently balancing alignment quality and computational cost.

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for subset selection in multinomial distributions to identify the best-performing machine learning algorithm from benchmark data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting the top-performing algorithm when performance differences are marginal, ensuring high confidence in the choice.

Method: Proposes asymptotic and finite-sample schemes for subset selection, improving upon existing methods and providing matching lower bounds.

Result: The proposed schemes significantly outperform current methods, with theoretical guarantees of performance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust solution for subset selection, validated by both theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

TL;DR: A ResNet-based HAR model detects gait and everyday activities with high accuracy and robustness across smartphone wear locations, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a HAR model with minimal overhead for detecting gait and everyday activities, applicable to both healthy individuals and people with multiple sclerosis.

Method: Used ResNet architecture, trained and evaluated on smartphone sensor data from healthy controls and PwMS, incorporating datasets like GaitLab, Roche, and public sources.

Result: Achieved 98.4%-99.6% accuracy for gait detection and 96.2% for everyday activities, outperforming state-of-the-art models and maintaining high performance across 9 wear locations.

Conclusion: The HAR model is accurate, robust, and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PITI-DeepONet improves long-term PDE solutions by learning time-derivative operators, reducing errors significantly compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods (FR and AR) fail in long-term accuracy due to poor generalization and error accumulation.

Method: PITI-DeepONet uses a dual-output architecture trained with physics-informed objectives, integrating time-derivative operators via classical time-stepping.

Result: Reduced mean relative errors by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for heat equation; similar improvements for Burgers and Allen-Cahn equations.

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet enables more reliable long-term integration of time-dependent PDEs, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, focusing on context-aware masked span prediction using real-world financial documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LLMs undermines financial analysis due to minor numerical errors, and existing benchmarks lack coverage of financial-specific requirements.

Method: Developed a scalable framework with automated dataset creation (masking strategy), a new hallucination evaluation dataset from S&P 500 reports, and evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Identified intrinsic hallucination patterns in financial LLMs, providing a robust methodology for in-house evaluation.

Conclusion: The work advances trustworthy financial Generative AI by addressing hallucinations in tabular data.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAR (Bidding-Aware Retrieval) addresses inconsistency in online ad systems by integrating bid values into retrieval, improving revenue and ad performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistency between retrieval and ranking stages in ad systems, due to lack of real-time bid access, harms revenue and advertiser outcomes.

Method: BAR uses Bidding-Aware Modeling (monotonicity-constrained learning, multi-task distillation) and Asynchronous Near-Line Inference for real-time updates, plus Task-Attentive Refinement for feature disentanglement.

Result: Deployment on Alibaba's platform showed a 4.32% revenue increase and 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated ads.

Conclusion: BAR effectively resolves multi-stage inconsistency, enhancing platform revenue and ad performance.

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining LSTM, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer, and attention mechanisms outperforms traditional methods in predicting Rate of Penetration (ROP) with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ROP prediction is challenging due to complex drilling data dynamics, and existing models fail to capture intricate relationships, limiting real-time utility.

Method: Proposes a hybrid architecture integrating LSTM, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer blocks, and attention mechanisms to model temporal dependencies and feature interactions.

Result: Achieves an R-squared score of 0.9988 and MAPE of 1.447%, outperforming benchmarks. Interpretability confirmed via SHAP and LIME.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, advancing intelligent drilling optimization systems.

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW) to improve causal effect estimation by stabilizing weights and better balancing covariates compared to traditional methods like IPW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing instability and inaccuracy in propensity score-based weighting methods (e.g., IPW) due to high variance in propensity scores, which degrades selection bias handling and treatment effect estimation.

Method: Introduces DFW, leveraging a deconfounding factor to construct stable weights, prioritizing less confounded samples and bounding weights to improve covariate balance. Extends to multi-treatment settings.

Result: DFW outperforms IPW and CBPS in covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: DFW provides a robust alternative to traditional propensity score methods, enhancing causal inference from observational data.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early intervention is crucial to slow physical deterioration in older adults. Predicting SPPB scores can aid timely action.

Method: Tested ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, dense and TabNet neural networks) on questionnaire data. Used Shapley values for feature selection.

Result: XGBoost achieved the lowest MAE (0.79). Feature selection yielded slightly higher MAE (0.82) but with fewer features.

Conclusion: XGBoost is effective for SPPB prediction. Feature selection maintains performance while simplifying the model.

Abstract: Effective slowing down of older adults\' physical capacity deterioration
requires intervention as soon as the first symptoms surface. In this paper, we
analyze the possibility of predicting the Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB) score at a four-year horizon based on questionnaire data. The ML
algorithms tested included Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, dense and
TabNet neural networks. The best results were achieved for the XGBoost (mean
absolute error of 0.79 points). Based on the Shapley values analysis, we
selected smaller subsets of features (from 10 to 20) and retrained the XGBoost
regressor, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.82.

TL;DR: Proposes LIGHTYEAR, a decentralized P2P FL framework using agreement scores for personalized, robust model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of centralized FL (single point of failure, poor personalization, vulnerability to adversarial clients) by enabling clients to select trustworthy updates.

Method: Uses agreement scores on local validation sets to select updates, with regularization for stability.

Result: Outperforms centralized and existing P2P methods, especially in adversarial and heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR enhances FL robustness and personalization through decentralized, agreement-based update selection.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

TL;DR: Cross-LoRA is a data-free framework for transferring LoRA modules between diverse LLMs, using LoRA-Align and LoRA-Shift, achieving performance gains without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PEFT methods like LoRA are limited by their tight coupling with base model architectures, restricting their use across heterogeneous LLMs.

Method: Cross-LoRA uses LoRA-Align (subspace alignment via SVD and linear transformation) and LoRA-Shift (projecting aligned subspaces) to transfer LoRA modules without data or training.

Result: Achieves up to 5.26% relative gains on benchmarks like ARCs, OBOA, and HellaSwag, with performance comparable to directly trained LoRA adapters.

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA enables efficient, lightweight adaptation of LoRA modules across diverse LLMs, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

*Xiaodong Chen,Mingming Ha,Zhenzhong Lan,Jing Zhang,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE), a novel method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MoE-based LLMs face high memory demands in deployment, and existing compression methods lead to significant accuracy drops.

Method: MoBE decomposes expert matrices into unique and shared basis components, minimizing reconstruction error.

Result: MoBE reduces parameters by 24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: MoBE offers an effective solution for compressing MoE models while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

TL;DR: A hybrid LSTM-RF model is proposed for predicting marine chlorophyll concentration, outperforming standalone LSTM and RF models with higher accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of marine chlorophyll concentration is vital for ecosystem health monitoring and red tide warnings.

Method: A hybrid LSTM-RF model is trained using multi-source ocean data (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen) with standardized treatment and sliding window techniques.

Result: The LSTM-RF model achieved R^2=0.5386, MSE=0.005806, and MAE=0.057147, outperforming standalone LSTM (R^2=0.0208) and RF (R^2=0.4934).

Conclusion: The hybrid model provides an innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological variables.

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

*Lars Graf,Thomas Ortner,Stanisław Woźniak,Angeliki Pantazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowState, a novel time series foundation model, addresses generalization and efficiency issues in existing models through a state space model encoder and functional basis decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models struggle with generalization, adaptability, and computational efficiency, limiting their effectiveness in forecasting.

Method: FlowState uses a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder for continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment. It also includes an efficient pretraining strategy.

Result: FlowState outperforms other models on GIFT-ZS and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, demonstrating superior generalization, efficiency, and adaptability.

Conclusion: FlowState's innovations enable robust, efficient, and adaptable time series forecasting, setting a new standard for foundation models in this domain.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

*Zhongheng Yang,Aijia Sun,Yushang Zhao,Yinuo Yang,Dannier Li,Chengrui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using RLHF to align LLM-based CRS with user preferences by optimizing implied feedback signals like dwell time and engagement, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised fine-tuning fails to capture implicit user feedback, necessitating a method to align CRS with user preferences dynamically.

Method: Uses RLHF with a reward model trained on weakly-labeled engagement data and optimizes the LLM via PPO, modeling conversational state transitions.

Result: RLHF-fine-tuned models achieve better top-k recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Implicit signal alignment via RLHF is efficient for scalable and user-adaptive CRS design.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimal batch-size and learning-rate schedules improve training efficiency and convergence in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in deep learning by optimizing batch-size and learning-rate scheduling for better efficiency and generalization.

Method: Analyzed using stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, deriving optimal growth schedules for batch size and learning rate.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation of schedules that reduce SFO complexity, enhancing large-batch training.

Conclusion: Provides scalable and efficient guidelines for large-batch training in deep learning.

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

TL;DR: Fairy±i introduces a 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs, surpassing the accuracy ceiling of full-precision models by leveraging complex domain advantages and enabling efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error without surpassing the full-precision accuracy ceiling. This work aims to break this ceiling by improving full-precision models and quantizing them efficiently.

Method: The method maps weights to the fourth roots of unity (±1, ±i), creating a symmetric 2-bit representation. It enables multiplication-free inference using additions and swaps.

Result: Fairy±i outperforms existing 2-bit methods in PPL and downstream tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: This work pioneers highly accurate and practical LLMs under extreme low-bit constraints, opening a new research direction.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

*Hikaru Umeda,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive scheduling strategy for mini-batch SGD, adjusting batch size and learning rate based on gradient norm decay to improve convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mini-batch SGD's convergence is sensitive to batch size and learning rate settings, and existing schedulers may not optimize efficiency.

Method: An adaptive joint scheduler adjusts batch size and learning rate dynamically using observed gradient norm decay.

Result: Experiments show the proposed scheduler improves convergence speed over existing methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive scheduling leveraging critical batch size theory enhances SGD efficiency.

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

TL;DR: LLMs can generate interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) for clinical decision support, with iterative refinement improving accuracy and reducing training needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' potential for generating accurate CPs for clinical phenotypes, enabling scalable decision support for hypertension care.

Method: Proposed a synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy for iterative CP refinement using LLMs and data-driven feedback.

Result: LLMs with iterative learning produced interpretable, reasonably accurate CPs, nearing state-of-the-art ML performance with fewer examples.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for CP generation, offering scalable clinical decision support with reduced training requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

*Jelle Luijkx,Zlatan Ajanović,Laura Ferranti,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASkDAgger reduces human teaching effort in interactive imitation learning by leveraging novice plans and teacher feedback through SAG, FIER, and PIER components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human teaching effort is a bottleneck in interactive imitation learning, and existing methods don't utilize novice plans effectively.

Method: Introduces ASkDAgger with S-Aware Gating (SAG), Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), and Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay (PIER).

Result: Validated in language-conditioned manipulation tasks, showing reduced queries, improved generalization, and faster adaptation.

Conclusion: ASkDAgger effectively balances query frequency, reduces annotations, and enhances learning performance.

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

*Yue Duan,Taicai Chen,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USP is a framework for semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that improves learning plasticity, unlabeled learning, and memory stability through three strategies: FSR, DCP, and CUD. It outperforms prior methods by up to 5.94%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of SSCL, including balancing unlabeled learning, memory stability, and learning plasticity, which previous methods tackled in isolation.

Method: USP uses three strategies: (1) FSR for learning plasticity, (2) DCP for unlabeled learning, and (3) CUD for memory stability.

Result: USP outperforms prior SSCL methods, achieving up to 5.94% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: USP effectively enhances SSCL by synergistically addressing its core challenges, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCAT improves CAT by fine-tuning only corpus-related parameters, boosting accuracy and resilience to overfitting, with significant improvements in translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and error-proneness of pre-defining high-quality data in CAT, OCAT fine-tunes a CAT model more effectively.

Method: OCAT fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most parameters and tuning only corpus-related ones.

Result: +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvements in WMT23 English to Chinese and German tasks, respectively, outperforming vanilla training and matching other fine-tuning techniques.

Conclusion: OCAT is lightweight, effective, and less sensitive to hyperparameters, making it a robust alternative to existing fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

### [246] [Latent Preference Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05367)
*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits by requiring only a model of action preference ordering in each latent state, enabling variability in reward distributions. A posterior-sampling algorithm is introduced, showing competitive or superior performance to traditional latent bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from scratch is costly for personalization tasks with limited decision points. Latent bandits reduce exploration time but require accurate joint distribution models, which are hard to obtain and may not fit all individuals.

Method: The paper relaxes latent bandit assumptions to only require action preference ordering models. It introduces a posterior-sampling algorithm for this setup.

Result: The algorithm performs competitively with traditional latent bandits when reward distributions are well-specified and outperforms them when reward scales differ.

Conclusion: Relaxing assumptions to focus on preference ordering allows more flexibility and better performance in scenarios with varying reward scales.

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo is an RL system that decouples inference and training phases for LLMs, using heterogeneous clusters and lightweight protocols to maintain efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training for LLMs forces serial context switching between inference and training, violating SPMD assumptions and reducing efficiency.

Method: Echo decouples inference and training across heterogeneous clusters, using sequential pull and asynchronous push-pull synchronization protocols.

Result: Echo matches co-located baselines in convergence speed and reward while utilizing decentralized, edge hardware for trajectory generation.

Conclusion: Echo demonstrates that large-scale RL for LLMs can achieve datacentre-grade performance with decentralized, heterogeneous resources.

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

TL;DR: NT-ML, a novel defense mechanism, effectively counters backdoor attacks in DNNs by combining non-target label training and mutual learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, necessitating robust defense mechanisms to restore poisoned models.

Method: NT-ML involves retraining with non-target labels (NT) and mutual learning (ML) between teacher and student models to purify the student model.

Result: NT-ML successfully defends against 6 backdoor attacks with minimal clean samples and surpasses 5 state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: NT-ML is an effective and advanced solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in DNNs.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

TL;DR: The paper examines adaptive learning rate mechanisms in deep learning, focusing on a 2017 cumulative path-based method. It identifies inconsistencies in its application to Adam and proposes a corrected variant, benchmarking it against SGD and Adam with and without adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate mechanisms and address inconsistencies in their application to optimizers like Adam.

Method: Revisits a 2017 cumulative path-based adaptation scheme, proposes a corrected variant for Adam, and benchmarks it against SGD, Adam, and a recent alternative method.

Result: The study clarifies the benefits and limitations of adaptive learning rate strategies, particularly for Adam.

Conclusion: The corrected variant improves consistency with Adam's dynamics, and the benchmarks provide insights into when adaptive learning rates are beneficial.

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

TL;DR: A novel causality-aware framework for molecular generation from text, combining a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) and Variational Mean Flow (VMF), outperforms existing methods in quality, diversity, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-conditioned molecular generation struggle with balancing high-quality, diverse outputs and fast inference.

Method: Proposes CAT for joint encoding of molecular graphs and text with causal dependencies, and VMF for efficient one-step inference using a Gaussian mixture latent space.

Result: Achieves higher novelty (74.5%), diversity (70.3%), and 100% validity, with significant computational efficiency (1-5 NFEs).

Conclusion: The framework sets a new benchmark for text-conditioned molecular generation, excelling in performance and speed.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is difficult due to volatility and non-stationarity. ESNs have shown promise in modeling stock markets, but their application to cryptocurrencies is underexplored.

Method: The study employs ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting and includes chaos analysis via the Lyapunov exponent during volatile periods.

Conclusion: ESNs are robust and effective for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during high volatility, making them a superior choice over traditional methods.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

*Yixuan Zhang,Wenxin Zhang,Hua Jiang,Quyu Kong,Feng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NegBio-VAE extends VAEs to model neural spike counts using the negative binomial distribution, improving accuracy by addressing overdispersion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VAEs and Poisson-VAE fail to capture the true stochastic nature of neural spike trains due to rigid constraints.

Method: Introduces NegBio-VAE with negative binomial distribution, two ELBO optimization schemes, and differentiable reparameterization strategies.

Result: Significant gains in reconstruction fidelity by explicitly modeling overdispersion.

Conclusion: NegBio-VAE's minor but impactful change enhances neural representation accuracy.

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

*Jiansheng Rao,Jiayi Li,Zhizhi Gong,Soummya Kar,Haoxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CR-FMOL introduces a federated MOO framework with a preference-cone constraint to ensure client-wise Pareto optimality, improving fairness in FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of FedAvg and FMOL in serving minority clients fairly by enforcing client-wise Pareto optimality.

Method: Uses cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problems after local FMGDA/FSMGDA steps to ensure Pareto-stationary directions for all clients.

Result: Enhances client fairness on non-IID benchmarks, with comparable accuracy to FedAvg over time.

Conclusion: CR-FMOL is a promising approach for fairer federated learning, balancing performance and fairness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

*Ziyin Gu,Jingyao Wang,Ran Zuo,Chuxiong Sun,Zeen Song,Changwen Zheng,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCPO improves upon GRPO by incorporating causal analysis to address overlooked semantic interactions among candidate responses, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains require targeted post-training for LLMs, and existing methods like GRPO ignore semantic interactions among responses.

Method: Introduces a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to reveal dependencies, then proposes GCPO with causally informed reward adjustment and KL regularization.

Result: GCPO outperforms GRPO and other methods in reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating causal structure into optimization enhances LLM performance in specialized tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

*Qinglong Hu,Xialiang Tong,Mingxuan Yuan,Fei Liu,Zhichao Lu,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLES combines multimodal large language models with evolutionary search to create interpretable, high-performance control policies, matching PPO's efficiency while offering transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep reinforcement learning lacks interpretability, hindering trust and deployment in safety-critical tasks. MLES aims to address this by integrating interpretability with performance.

Method: MLES uses multimodal large language models as policy generators, evolutionary search for optimization, and visual feedback for behavior analysis and targeted improvements.

Result: MLES matches PPO's performance in control tasks while providing transparent logic and traceable design, overcoming domain-specific language limitations.

Conclusion: MLES is a scalable, promising approach for interpretable control policy discovery, facilitating knowledge transfer and reuse.

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

### [256] [Competing Risks: Impact on Risk Estimation and Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05435)
*Vincent Jeanselme,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the bias and disparities caused by treating competing risks as censoring in survival analysis, proposing a framework to quantify the error and its fairness implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked consequences of misclassifying competing risks as censoring in survival analysis, which leads to biased risk estimates and amplifies disparities.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework to quantify the error from treating competing risks as censoring and examines its impact on predictive performance and algorithmic fairness, supported by empirical analysis of cardiovascular management.

Result: Demonstrates that ignoring competing risks introduces substantial bias, overestimates risk, and exacerbates disparities, disproportionately affecting high-risk individuals.

Conclusion: Practitioners must account for competing risks to improve accuracy, reduce disparities, and better inform decisions in survival analysis.

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

### [257] [Tail-Risk-Safe Monte Carlo Tree Search under PAC-Level Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05441)
*Zuyuan Zhang,Arnob Ghosh,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS to address tail-risk in MCTS, providing rigorous safety guarantees and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety-aware MCTS methods lack rigorous tail-safety guarantees, risking severe outcomes in high-stake scenarios.

Method: 1. CVaR-MCTS embeds Conditional Value-at-Risk for tail-risk control. 2. W-MCTS uses Wasserstein ambiguity sets to address estimation bias.

Result: Both methods provide PAC tail-safety guarantees and outperform baselines in simulations, improving rewards and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address tail-risk in MCTS, offering robust safety guarantees and performance improvements.

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

*Wei Li,Zixin Wang,Qizheng Sun,Qixiang Gao,Fenglei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnergyPatchTST, a Patch Time Series Transformer extension, improves energy time series prediction with multi-scale feature extraction, probability prediction, and future variable integration, reducing errors by 7-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with multi-scale time dynamics and data irregularity in energy forecasting.

Method: Proposes EnergyPatchTST with multi-scale feature extraction, Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation, future variable integration, and pre-training/fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms common methods, reducing prediction error by 7-12% and providing reliable uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST offers a robust solution for energy time series prediction, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

*Robert Jankowski,Filippo Radicchi,M. Ángeles Serrano,Marián Boguñá,Santo Fortunato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces five data-agnostic probes to study how task difficulty affects neural network representations, revealing insights into robustness, topology, and practical applications like model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neural network representations are shaped by task complexity and input data, given their black-box nature.

Method: Uses five probes (pruning, binarization, noise injection, sign flipping, bipartite randomization) on MLPs, analyzed as signed bipartite graphs, tested on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

Result: Hard-task models collapse under binarization, while easy-task models remain robust. Pruning reveals phase transitions, noise can enhance accuracy, and sign structure alone maintains performance.

Conclusion: Task complexity can be measured by performance gaps in binarized/shuffled networks. Findings emphasize signed bipartite topology's role and suggest practical strategies for model compression and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces gaming-resistant mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth, using f-mutual information measures, and demonstrates their robustness and effectiveness across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating AI systems without ground truth and prevent gaming of metrics, ensuring reliable assessment of output quality.

Method: Develops mechanisms based on f-mutual information measures, proving their uniqueness and gaming resistance under natural conditions. Uses empirical testing across ten domains.

Result: Achieves perfect discrimination between faithful and strategic agents, with 10-100x better robustness to adversarial manipulation. Performance peaks at a 10:1 compression ratio.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms offer a robust solution for AI evaluation, outperforming current practices and providing insights into optimal conditions for effectiveness.

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

*Vincent Jeanselme,Glen Martin,Matthew Sperrin,Niels Peek,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-task recurrent neural network is proposed to jointly model inter-observation time, missingness, and survival outcomes, improving clinical prediction model performance and transportability by accounting for clinical presence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical presence (interaction between patients and healthcare systems) impacts observed outcomes in electronic health records, but is often overlooked in prediction models, limiting their transportability.

Method: A multi-task recurrent neural network jointly models inter-observation time, missingness, and survival outcomes to address clinical presence.

Result: The proposed model improves performance and transportability in mortality prediction tasks on the MIMIC-III dataset compared to models ignoring clinical presence.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical presence into prediction models enhances performance and transportability, making them more adaptable to new settings.

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

TL;DR: MoMA is a novel architecture using multiple LLM agents to integrate multimodal EHR data for clinical predictions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal EHR data offers richer insights but integrating diverse modalities is challenging due to high data requirements.

Method: MoMA uses specialist LLM agents to convert non-textual data into structured summaries, an aggregator LLM to unify summaries, and a predictor LLM for clinical predictions.

Result: MoMA outperforms current methods in accuracy and flexibility across three real-world prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MoMA effectively integrates multimodal EHR data, enhancing clinical prediction accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two parameter-free algorithms, AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, for multi-view clustering, addressing challenges like high-dimensional features and cross-view integration. The methods use entropy regularization and signal-to-noise ratio-based feature weighting for adaptive consensus and dimensionality reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view clustering methods require manual parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration, limiting their effectiveness in handling heterogeneous data.

Method: The proposed algorithms replace fuzzification parameters with entropy regularization and signal-to-noise ratio-based feature weighting. AAMVFCM-U adds hierarchical dimensionality reduction via adaptive thresholding.

Result: The methods outperform 15 state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving 97% computational efficiency, reducing dimensionality to 0.45%, and identifying optimal view combinations.

Conclusion: The unified framework offers a robust, parameter-free solution for multi-view clustering, enhancing pattern discovery and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

TL;DR: The paper addresses overfitting in Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) by proposing a Hessian-based regularizer, improving generalization by guiding PCs toward flatter minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in deep and expressive PCs, especially with limited data, is analyzed from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective, identifying sharp optima as a cause.

Method: A Hessian-based regularizer is introduced, leveraging the tractable trace of the Hessian of log-likelihood in PCs, enabling efficient computation and simple updates for EM and gradient-based methods.

Result: Experiments show the method consistently leads PCs to flatter minima and enhances generalization on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed regularizer effectively mitigates overfitting in PCs, improving their generalization performance.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

TL;DR: The paper provides a structured survey on unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing approaches into four paradigms and analyzing their methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show strong generalization but underperform in specific tasks without adaptation. Unsupervised methods are needed for data efficiency, but a unified survey is lacking.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy based on unlabeled visual data availability, categorizing approaches into Data-Free Transfer, Unsupervised Domain Transfer, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation, and Online Test-Time Adaptation.

Result: A comprehensive overview of methodologies and benchmarks is provided, along with open challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: The survey bridges the gap in understanding unsupervised VLM adaptation and offers a structured framework for future research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An

### [266] [X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568)
*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL is a new Vertical Federated Learning framework addressing non-aligned data and missing features, enabling local inference with novel modules XCom and DS-Align.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in VFL: perfectly aligned data and joint inference requirements.

Method: Proposes X-VFL with XCom for feature completion and DS-Align for decision subspace alignment.

Result: Achieves 15% and 43% accuracy improvements on CIFAR-10 and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: X-VFL is effective for scenarios with missing features and local inference, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly

X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

### [267] [Enhancing PyKEEN with Multiple Negative Sampling Solutions for Knowledge Graph Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05587)
*Claudia d'Amato,Ivan Diliso,Nicola Fanizzi,Zafar Saeed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension for PyKEEN to integrate advanced negative samplers for knowledge graph embedding, enhancing performance and compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative sampling is crucial for embedding models, but existing libraries lack advanced strategies, limiting performance and flexibility.

Method: Developed a PyKEEN extension with modular architecture for advanced negative samplers (static and dynamic).

Result: Empirical study shows improved performance in link prediction tasks, offering insights for better strategy design.

Conclusion: The extension enhances PyKEEN, enabling easier development and customization of embedding methods.

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

*Thorsten Peinemann,Paula Arnold,Sebastian Berndt,Thomas Eisenbarth,Esfandiar Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'one-poison hypothesis,' proving that a single poison sample can inject a backdoor into ML models without affecting benign task performance, validated for linear models and benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the open question of the minimal poison data required for successful backdoor attacks, challenging prior assumptions about attack feasibility.

Method: Formulates the one-poison hypothesis, proves it for linear regression and classification, and validates with experiments on benchmark datasets.

Result: Demonstrates that a single poison sample can achieve zero backdooring-error with negligible impact on benign task performance.

Conclusion: The one-poison hypothesis holds, showing backdoor attacks can be highly efficient with minimal data, posing new security challenges.

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shuffle-R1 improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by addressing Advantage Collapsing and Rollout Silencing through dynamic trajectory sampling and batch composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL pipelines for MLLMs suffer from inefficiencies due to Advantage Collapsing and Rollout Silencing, hindering long-term learning.

Method: Proposes Pairwise Trajectory Sampling and Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle to enhance gradient signal and rollout exposure.

Result: Outperforms RL baselines on reasoning benchmarks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Data-centric adaptations like Shuffle-R1 are crucial for efficient RL training in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajEvo uses LLMs and evolutionary algorithms to automate heuristic design for trajectory prediction, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods, especially in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristics lack accuracy and generalizability, while deep learning methods are computationally expensive and struggle with OOD scenarios.

Method: TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm with Cross-Generation Elite Sampling and a Statistics Feedback Loop to refine heuristics using LLMs.

Result: TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic and deep learning methods, particularly in OOD generalization.

Conclusion: TrajEvo advances automated, fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT has limited generalization compared to RL due to problematic reward structures in its gradients.

Method: Proposes DFT, which dynamically rescales the objective function for each token based on its probability, stabilizing gradient updates.

Result: DFT significantly outperforms standard SFT in benchmarks and shows competitive results in offline RL.

Conclusion: DFT bridges theory and practice, advancing SFT performance with a simple yet effective solution.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive

Result: Identifies key limitations like computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and lack of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data.

Conclusion: Outlines open challenges and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding using Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene

TL;DR: Voost is a unified framework using a diffusion transformer for virtual try-on and try-off, improving garment-body reasoning without extra networks or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate garment-body correspondence in virtual try-on is challenging under pose and appearance variations.

Method: Joint learning of try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer, using bidirectional supervision and flexible conditioning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on try-on and try-off benchmarks in alignment, fidelity, and generalization.

Conclusion: Voost effectively addresses garment-body correspondence challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla 3DGS densification strategy has shortcomings, limiting high-quality novel view synthesis.

Method: Introduces a density control method using Gaussian function volumes of inertia and evaluates SfM and DIM for point cloud initialization.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS in reconstruction quality on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances 3DGS performance, offering better results across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS struggles with large-scale scenes and storage efficiency, especially in complex environments or with limited resources.

Method: Introduces a scene perception compensation algorithm, pyramid sampling representation, and Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression for hierarchical Gaussian management.

Result: Significant improvements in memory efficiency and visual quality, with maintained real-time rendering speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses scalability and storage challenges in 3DGS without compromising performance or fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory

TL;DR: A novel dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework addresses challenges in dynamic scene modeling by combining explicit-implicit functions, spectral-aware encoding, and adaptive strategies for better fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS methods struggle with over-smoothing or feature collision due to spectral conflicts in preserving motion details and deformation consistency.

Method: The framework includes a spectral-aware Laplacian encoding, enhanced Gaussian dynamics attributes, and an adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes with improved fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively balances motion detail preservation and deformation consistency, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for audio-driven portrait animation are computationally complex, making real-time deployment challenging. RAP aims to address this by balancing quality and efficiency.

Method: RAP uses a hybrid attention mechanism for fine-grained audio control and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm without explicit motion supervision.

Result: RAP achieves precise audio-visual synchronization, mitigates temporal drift, and maintains high visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-time.

Conclusion: RAP successfully combines efficiency and quality, making it suitable for real-time applications while preserving fine-grained details.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new 3D point cloud segmentation paradigm for clothed human modeling, addressing challenges like realistic wrinkles and semantic reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D cloth modeling is essential for avatars in fashion, entertainment, and animation, but current methods lack semantic information and struggle with overlapping layers in clothed bodies.

Method: Proposes a clothed human layering segmentation paradigm, where each 3D point can belong to multiple layers. Uses synthetic datasets and neural networks for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates improved segmentation for garment domains on synthetic and real-world datasets, enabling better estimation of underlying body parts and occluded clothing regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances 3D clothed body modeling by addressing overlapping layers and semantic reconstruction, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Motivation: To enable fully controllable, physically based illumination editing in real-world images, combining traditional rendering's accuracy with neural rendering's photorealism.

Method: Infer a colored mesh from monocular geometry and intrinsic estimates, define desired 3D lighting, render with path-tracing, and refine with a neural renderer. Training is self-supervised via differentiable rendering on raw images.

Result: Achieves photorealistic relighting with explicit physical control, bridging the gap between 3D graphics tools and real-world images.

Conclusion: The method advances in-the-wild relighting by integrating physical and neural rendering, offering practical control over illumination.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

Result: Achieves coverage of all nine entanglement families and some SLOCC classes with optimal circuits.

Conclusion: The algorithm and SLG tool simplify entangled state construction, offering practical and theoretical insights.

Abstract: We have devised an artificial intelligence algorithm with machine
reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to construct remarkable entangled states
with 4 qubits. This way, the algorithm is able to generate representative
states for some of the 49 true SLOCC classes of the four-qubit entanglement
states. In particular, it is possible to reach at least one true SLOCC class
for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by
the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important
classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic
properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link
graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) used
by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the
corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary
connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain
quantum gates that the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of
actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to
the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive
and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a
low number of qubits.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Q-DPTS is a quantum-classical framework for differentially private time series forecasting, combining VQCs with DP mechanisms to improve robustness and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between privacy (via DP) and model performance in sensitive domains like finance and energy systems.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical framework using VQCs, per-sample gradient clipping, and Gaussian noise injection for $\epsilon, \delta$-DP.

Result: Q-DPTS outperforms classical and quantum baselines (LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, QLSTM) in prediction error under the same privacy budget.

Conclusion: Q-DPTS offers a promising privacy-utility trade-off, pioneering quantum-enhanced DP for secure time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in solving complex aeroelastic problems, particularly time series classification and regression tasks.

Method: A hybrid algorithm encodes time series into tensor networks, reduces dimensionality, converts to quantum circuits, and applies variational quantum circuits for classification or regression.

Result: High accuracy in binary classification and promising results in regression tasks, though hyperparameter optimization is challenging.

Conclusion: This work advances QML for aeroelastic applications, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum tensor networks despite optimization hurdles.

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to
aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate
the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and
regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor
networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we
observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate
or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Motivation: Overcome interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and complex optimization in quantum sensor development using LLMs.

Method: Integrates commercial LLMs with few-shot prompts, vector knowledge base, and specialized agents for adaptive optimization, modeling, and diagnosis.

Result: Achieved 10^8 sub-μK atoms in atom cooling experiments with ~100x speedup and autonomous anomaly detection.

Conclusion: QCopilot reduces barriers to quantum sensor deployment and is adaptable to other quantum systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active
learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and
diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and
vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select
optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform
problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic
modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in
multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale
quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure pulse-based QML models are both expressive and trainable, avoiding issues like barren plateaus and uncontrollability.

Method: Analyze requirements for expressivity and trainability, supported by numerical simulations, focusing on initial state, measurement observable, and dynamical symmetry Lie algebra.

Result: A necessary condition is established for designing practical pulse-based QML models that maintain expressivity and trainability.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for designing effective pulse-based QML models by balancing expressivity and trainability.

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

*Jiazheng Zhang,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses low success rates in LLM-based RTL code generation by analyzing errors and proposing targeted corrections, improving accuracy by 32.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unsatisfactory success rate of LLM-based RTL code generation due to unclear failure causes motivates a comprehensive error analysis and solution development.

Method: The study involves error categorization, in-context learning, a domain-specific knowledge base, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), design description rules, rule-checking, multimodal input conversion, and iterative debugging.

Result: The enhanced framework achieves 91.0% accuracy on VerilogEval, a 32.7% improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: Targeted error correction techniques significantly improve LLM-based RTL code generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) with deep reinforcement learning for improved RF sensing accuracy, even under jamming attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RF sensing methods suffer from accuracy issues due to unpredictable radio environments like fading and noise.

Method: A DRL algorithm optimizes beamforming patterns, and a neural network maps signals to sensing outcomes. A combined loss function accounts for SINR to handle interference.

Result: Simulations show the distributed RIMSA system outperforms centralized methods in efficiency and resilience to environmental challenges and jamming.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances RF sensing accuracy and robustness, even in adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology
across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense
industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure,
and property data presents significant challenges for predictive property
modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the
underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods
capable of learning from limited and heterogeneous datasets. This work presents
several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to
mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors
associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation
testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder
decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi

*Ilyas Fatkhullin,Florian Hübler,Guanghui Lan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that vanilla SGD can achieve optimal convergence rates under heavy-tailed noise, challenging the belief that it fails in such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously analyze whether vanilla SGD can succeed under heavy-tailed noise, common in modern ML, without adaptive modifications.

Method: Theoretical analysis of SGD under bounded $p$-th moments for $p \in (1, 2]$, covering convex, strongly convex, and non-convex problems.

Result: SGD achieves minimax optimal sample complexity in convex and strongly convex regimes, and converges to stationary points in non-convex cases.

Conclusion: Vanilla SGD is robust and theoretically sound even under heavy-tailed noise, debunking the notion that it requires modifications for such conditions.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale
optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common
in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly
understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid
of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse
stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded
$p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence
guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex
problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal
sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex
regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex
objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary
point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement
this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial
step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under
standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it
also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample
complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These
results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD
ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled
baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.

### [292] [Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Constrained Biclustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05493)
*Antonio M. Sudoso*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces constrained biclustering with pairwise constraints, proposing exact and heuristic algorithms for solving the k-densest disjoint biclique problem. The exact method uses a branch-and-cut algorithm with SDP relaxation, while the heuristic employs low-rank factorization and an augmented Lagrangian method. Both methods show strong performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance biclustering by incorporating background knowledge (must-link and cannot-link constraints) to improve solution quality and interpretability.

Method: The exact method is a branch-and-cut algorithm with SDP relaxation, valid inequalities, and rounding. The heuristic uses low-rank factorization, an augmented Lagrangian method, and block-coordinate projected gradient.

Result: The exact method outperforms general-purpose solvers, and the heuristic efficiently provides high-quality solutions for large instances.

Conclusion: Constrained biclustering with pairwise constraints is effectively addressed by the proposed exact and heuristic algorithms, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering,
simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal
submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into
clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted
growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research.
Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the
joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with
pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which
specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a
model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint
biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite
subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing
the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact
and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation,
strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion.
Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions
into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we
introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the
SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented
Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a
block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly
outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality
solutions efficiently on large instances.

*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPEAR introduces a structured language and runtime for managing prompts in LLM pipelines, enabling dynamic refinement and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompts in LLM pipelines are brittle and disconnected from dataflow, limiting reuse and control.

Method: SPEAR provides a prompt algebra for dynamic refinement and structured management, supporting manual, assisted, and automatic modes.

Result: Preliminary experiments show SPEAR's effectiveness in prompt refinement and optimization compared to static methods.

Conclusion: SPEAR addresses prompt management gaps, offering structured, adaptive, and optimized prompt handling in LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Motivation: Existing systems require expert coding and complex workflows, making them costly and slow. AgenticData aims to simplify this process.

Method: Uses feedback-driven planning to convert NL queries into semantic plans, multi-agent collaboration (data profiling, semantic cross-validation, smart memory), and semantic optimization.

Result: Tested on three benchmarks, AgenticData achieved superior accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AgenticData effectively automates complex data analytics, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Identified challenges and opportunities for refining safety guardrails, emphasizing iterative improvement and cross-sector collaboration.

Conclusion: Effective safety guardrails in generative AI education tools require ongoing refinement, open-source sharing, and collaboration.

Abstract: There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education
sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However,
this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the
AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper
explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within
the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI
tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to
support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are
appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated
with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1)
prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically
sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate
attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to
assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a
human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content
before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these
safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to
take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper
highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI
education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails,
as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source
code, datasets and learnings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image retrieval studies face limitations like small sample sizes and inadequate validation, hindering clinical translation. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The study evaluates CNN architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies (fine-tuning, metric learning, super-ensemble optimization) using rigorous data splitting and bootstrap validation.

Result: Advanced fine-tuning and super-ensemble optimization improved precision@10 significantly (e.g., DenseNet121: 34.79%, 19.64% improvement). The super-ensemble achieved 36.33% precision@10, exceeding literature benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework sets new performance benchmarks and provides evidence-based guidelines for clinical deployment, demonstrating practical efficiency and significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN

optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

### [298] [CryoGS: Gaussian Splatting for Cryo-EM Homogeneous Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04929)
*Suyi Chen,Haibin Ling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces cryoGS, a GMM-based method for cryo-EM reconstruction, enabling stable 3D molecular density reconstruction from noisy 2D projections without external initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GMM-based cryo-EM methods require external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines.

Method: cryoGS integrates Gaussian splatting with cryo-EM physics, featuring orthogonal projection-aware splatting, a normalization term, and an FFT-aligned coordinate system.

Result: Experiments show cryoGS is effective and robust, achieving stable reconstruction from raw particle images with random initialization.

Conclusion: cryoGS advances cryo-EM reconstruction by eliminating dependency on external initialization, offering a self-contained solution.

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

*Caner Özer,Patryk Rygiel,Bram de Wilde,İlkay Öksüz,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using implicit neural representations (INRs) for artifact detection in medical imaging, offering a compact and scalable solution compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in medical imaging reduce diagnostic accuracy, and existing methods are limited by preprocessing-induced information loss and high memory demands.

Method: The authors employ deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers on INRs for image quality assessment.

Result: Tested on the ACDC dataset with synthetic artifacts, the method performs effectively with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: INRs provide a scalable and efficient approach for artifact detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: A pipeline using 3D CycleGAN for unpaired style transfer enhances MR-US image registration via synthetic T1 images, combining affine and deformable transformations for better consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve registration accuracy between pre-surgery MR and post-resection US images, addressing the challenge of unpaired data.

Method: Uses 3D CycleGAN for synthetic T1 image generation and employs affine + local deformable transformations for coarse-to-fine registration.

Result: Improved consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively enhances registration performance for MR-US image pairs.

Abstract: We developed a pipeline for registering pre-surgery Magnetic Resonance (MR)
images and post-resection Ultrasound (US) images. Our approach leverages
unpaired style transfer using 3D CycleGAN to generate synthetic T1 images,
thereby enhancing registration performance. Additionally, our registration
process employs both affine and local deformable transformations for a
coarse-to-fine registration. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
the consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI models outperform pathologists in distinguishing Spitz tumors from melanomas and predicting genetic aberrations and diagnostic categories, with potential workflow improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spitz tumors are hard to diagnose due to overlapping features with melanomas, prompting investigation into AI's diagnostic capabilities.

Method: AI models were trained on 393 Spitz tumors and 379 melanomas, validated using AUROC and accuracy, and compared to pathologists in a reader study.

Result: AI achieved AUROC 0.95 and accuracy 0.86 in tumor-melanoma differentiation, outperforming pathologists in all tasks, though not always significantly.

Conclusion: AI shows strong diagnostic potential for Spitz tumors, with workflow benefits, but challenges remain in genetic and category prediction.

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

TL;DR: Evaluation of optimizers for S&P 500 forecasting with MambaStock, introducing Roaree to combine speed and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the best optimizers for forecasting S&P 500 returns and address limitations of existing methods.

Method: Tested gradient-smoothing and adaptive-rate optimizers (Adam, RMSProp) and Lion, then introduced Roaree.

Result: Adam and RMSProp had lowest test errors, Lion was faster, and Roaree combined speed with stability.

Conclusion: Roaree optimizers effectively balance training speed and loss stability for financial forecasting.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of several optimizers on the task of forecasting
S&P 500 Index returns with the MambaStock model. Among the most widely used
algorithms, gradient-smoothing and adaptive-rate optimizers (for example, Adam
and RMSProp) yield the lowest test errors. In contrast, the Lion optimizer
offers notably faster training. To combine these advantages, we introduce a
novel family of optimizers, Roaree, that dampens the oscillatory loss behavior
often seen with Lion while preserving its training speed.

*Shiyi Du,Litian Liang,Jiayi Li,Carl Kingsford*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: CodonMoE is a lightweight adapter that transforms DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific pretraining, outperforming specialized RNA models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of maintaining separate models for DNA and RNA or using large multi-modal architectures, which are computationally burdensome.

Method: Introduces CodonMoE, a universal approximator at the codon level, mapping codon sequences to RNA properties.

Result: Outperforms unmodified DNA models in RNA prediction tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with 80% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a principled way to unify genomic language modeling, leveraging DNA data and reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge:
either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA
and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose
significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant
infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal
architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality
pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive
Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms
DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific
pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal
approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from
codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four
RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models
augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts,
with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80%
fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic
complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a
principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more
abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving
modality-specific performance advantages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework using GenoMAS, an AI system, to uncover molecular commonalities across diseases, revealing novel connections and potential therapeutic repurposing opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disease classification often misses molecular similarities due to divergent clinical presentations, limiting understanding and treatment options.

Method: The study analyzes over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, integrating pathway-based similarity and multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence.

Result: A disease similarity network identifies known comorbidities and new cross-category links, with insights into shared pathways and therapeutic opportunities for rare diseases.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the power of AI-driven transcriptomic analysis to reveal molecular mechanisms and improve disease classification and treatment strategies.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden
beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a
transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by
analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated
agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a
novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database
enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The
resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and
previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological
pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these
connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based
taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and
hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic
repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based
on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition,
this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale
transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across
complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at

*Tianxiang Hu,Chenyi Zhou,Jiaxiang Liu,Jiongxin Wang,Ruizhe Chen,Haoxiang Xia,Gaoang Wang,Jian Wu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-regularized optimization framework to refine zero-shot cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data, improving accuracy by up to 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual cell type annotation is labor-intensive and doesn't scale, while existing zero-shot methods like LangCell lack consistency.

Method: A graph-regularized optimization framework refines LangCell's zero-shot predictions using PCA-based k-NN graphs for local consistency.

Result: The method improves zero-shot accuracy by up to 10% across 14 datasets, spanning 11 organs and 200,000+ cells.

Conclusion: The training-free, model-agnostic approach enhances automated annotation by combining pre-trained models with structural robustness.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the
structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While
effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large
datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward
automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural
language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While
LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain
suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell
types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by
LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local
consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines
the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied
upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human
scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000
single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy,
achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism
by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling
back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is
training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for
enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.

*Nirjhor Datta,Swakkhar Shatabda,M Sohel Rahman*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Embedding-based pipelines using pre-trained DNA models outperform fine-tuning in efficiency and generalizability, reducing inference time and carbon emissions significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if task-specific fine-tuning is always necessary for pre-trained DNA models, given its cost and distribution sensitivity.

Method: Extract fixed embeddings from models like DNABERT-2 and HyenaDNA, then use lightweight classifiers for tasks.

Result: Embedding methods match or outperform fine-tuning in accuracy, with 10x-20x faster inference and lower carbon emissions.

Conclusion: Embedding extraction is a generalizable, efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for diverse genomic contexts.

Abstract: Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide
Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various
genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning,
which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution.
In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always
necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed
representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers
can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data
distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while
reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding
extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and
efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or
unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA
embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for
fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon
emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification,
DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89
with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2).
These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon
efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance. The code is

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tesserae, a scalable GPU cluster scheduler for deep learning workloads, using graph matching to optimize placement policies, improving job completion time and makespan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving resource utilization in DL clusters by addressing suboptimal performance and poor scalability of existing placement policies.

Method: Formulates placement constraints as graph matching problems, designing policies for minimizing migration overheads and job packing, integrated into Tesserae.

Result: Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and makespan by up to 1.15x compared to existing schedulers.

Conclusion: Tesserae's graph-based approach provides a scalable and effective solution for DL cluster scheduling.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs to adversarial attacks, identifies new attack surfaces, and proposes a defense framework called GALGUARD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of graph-aware LLMs against adversarial attacks, as their integration with graph-structured data is growing but their vulnerabilities remain unexplored.

Method: Leverages existing adversarial attack methods (poisoning and evasion) on models LLAGA and GRAPHPROMPTER, identifies new attack surfaces, and analyzes design choices affecting robustness.

Result: Finds that LLAGA is vulnerable due to its node sequence template, GRAPHPROMPTER's GNN encoder is more robust, and both are susceptible to feature perturbations.

Conclusion: Proposes GALGUARD, a defense framework combining LLM-based feature correction and GNN defenses to mitigate attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce hallucinations in LLM-based incident response planning using fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning, achieving faster recovery times and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of identifying effective incident response actions in complex systems by leveraging LLMs while minimizing hallucinations and costs.

Method: Three-step approach: fine-tuning an LLM, information retrieval, and lookahead planning to ensure bounded hallucination probability.

Result: Achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and generalizes across incident types and actions.

Conclusion: The method is lightweight, effective, and reduces hallucinations, making it practical for real-world incident response.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

*Albert Yu,Chengshu Li,Luca Macesanu,Arnav Balaji,Ruchira Ray,Raymond Mooney,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MICoBot is a system for human-robot collaboration using Mixed-Initiative dialog to adapt to diverse human partners, optimizing task allocation and communication for improved success and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems need to adapt to varying human behaviors and capabilities over time, requiring flexible communication and collaboration strategies.

Method: MICoBot operates at three levels: meta-planner for high-level strategy, planner for optimal task allocation, and action executor for low-level decisions. Evaluated in simulation and real-world with human participants.

Result: Demonstrated improved task success and user experience compared to LLM baselines and other allocation models.

Conclusion: MICoBot effectively collaborates with diverse humans, showcasing adaptability and efficiency in task completion.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

TL;DR: INTENTION is a framework combining Vision-Language Models and interaction-driven memory to enable robots with intuitive, adaptable manipulation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic control relies on precise models, limiting adaptability in real-world scenarios. Humans, however, use intuitive interaction, inspiring this work.

Method: INTENTION integrates VLMs for scene reasoning and a Memory Graph for task interaction history, alongside an Intuitive Perceptor for physical relation extraction.

Result: The framework allows robots to infer interaction behaviors in new scenes autonomously, without repetitive instructions.

Conclusion: INTENTION advances robotic manipulation by mimicking human-like adaptability and intuition.

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm to improve maze navigation in robotics by addressing sparse rewards and exploration inefficiencies in standard DDPG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DDPG struggles with maze navigation due to sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning, leading to low success rates.

Method: HDDPG uses high-level and low-level policies: high-level generates subgoals, low-level executes actions. Techniques like off-policy correction, adaptive noise, and reshaped rewards enhance performance.

Result: HDDPG improves success rates by at least 56.59% and boosts average rewards by 519.03 compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HDDPG effectively overcomes DDPG's limitations, offering a robust solution for complex maze navigation tasks.

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Chemist Eye is a safety monitoring system for self-driving labs (SDLs) that uses vision-language models to detect hazards like fires, PPE non-compliance, and emergencies, achieving high accuracy in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks in SDLs, especially fires near robots with flammable batteries, necessitate advanced monitoring to protect workers and equipment.

Method: The system integrates RGB, depth, and infrared cameras with a vision-language model for real-time hazard detection and robot redirection.

Result: Tests showed 97% accuracy in spotting hazards and 95% in decision-making.

Conclusion: Chemist Eye effectively enhances safety in SDLs through real-time monitoring and automated responses.

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

*Mohammed Daba,Jing Qiu*

TL;DR: FCBV-Net improves category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation by decoupling geometric understanding from bimanual action value learning, outperforming baselines in efficiency and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of category-level generalization in robotic garment manipulation due to high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and intra-category variations.

Method: Proposes FCBV-Net, a Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network using 3D point clouds and pre-trained geometric features for robust policy generalization.

Result: FCBV-Net showed superior generalization with only an 11.5% efficiency drop on unseen garments and 89% final coverage, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Decoupling geometric understanding from action value learning enhances category-level generalization in garment manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

TL;DR: TAVP improves robotic manipulation by integrating active view planning and task-specific representation learning, outperforming fixed-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static viewpoints and shared visual encoders in VLA models limit 3D perception and cause task interference, reducing robustness and generalization.

Method: TAVP uses active view planning with a pseudo-environment for efficient exploration and a Mixture-of-Experts visual encoder for task-specific features.

Result: TAVP achieves superior performance on RLBench tasks, enhancing action prediction and generalization.

Conclusion: Task-aware view planning and representation learning significantly improve robotic manipulation robustness and performance.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

TL;DR: DistillDrive enhances autonomous driving by using knowledge distillation and diversified planning instances for robust decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving models focus too much on ego-vehicle status and lack planning-oriented understanding, limiting robustness.

Method: Uses a planning model as a teacher for multi-objective learning, incorporates reinforcement learning, and generative modeling for planning-oriented instances.

Result: Achieves 50% lower collision rate and 3-point higher closed-loop performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets.

Conclusion: DistillDrive improves robustness and performance in autonomous driving through diversified learning and planning-oriented features.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and

Motivation: To explore how foundation models enhance robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces, addressing the fast-evolving field of agentic architectures.

Method: Survey of peer-reviewed research, community projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks, with a proposed taxonomy for model integration.

Conclusion: Foundation models are advancing robotics, with agentic architectures enabling natural language reasoning, API invocation, and task planning. The field is rapidly evolving, requiring ongoing research and community collaboration.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve mobile robot navigation in crowds by accounting for pedestrian uncertainties using adaptive conformal inference and constrained reinforcement learning, achieving higher success rates and robustness in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots trained with reinforcement learning often degrade in performance when encountering out-of-distribution scenarios. Addressing pedestrian uncertainties can enhance robustness.

Method: The method augments robot observations with prediction uncertainty estimates from adaptive conformal inference and uses constrained reinforcement learning to guide behavior.

Result: Achieves 96.93% success rate (8.80% higher than baselines), with fewer collisions and intrusions. Shows robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios like velocity variations and group dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach enables safe and robust robot navigation in crowds, validated by real-world deployment and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are

TL;DR: GF-VLA is a framework for teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos using task-level reasoning, scene graphs, and language-conditioned transformers, achieving high success rates in dual-arm tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of low-level trajectory imitation in robotics by enabling task-level reasoning and generalization across diverse scenarios.

Method: Extracts task-relevant cues, encodes them into scene graphs, fuses with a language-conditioned transformer to generate behavior trees and motion commands, and uses a cross-hand selection policy for bimanual efficiency.

Result: Achieves 95% graph accuracy, 93% subtask segmentation, 94% grasp success, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success in dual-arm tasks.

Conclusion: GF-VLA demonstrates strong generalization and robustness in diverse robotic tasks, outperforming traditional imitation methods.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme-inspired method to reduce the inference time of Diffusion Policies in robotic manipulation without additional training or policy redesign.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policies face limitations due to long inference times and action chunk execution, hindering their use in latency-critical tasks. Existing acceleration methods often require resource-intensive training.

Method: The proposed approach applies the RTI Scheme to diffusion inference, using previous solutions as initial guesses for iterations, and introduces a scaling-based method for discrete actions.

Result: The method significantly reduces runtime costs without performance loss, as shown in simulations, and integrates seamlessly with pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The RTI-inspired scheme offers a practical solution to accelerate Diffusion Policies, enabling broader application in robotics without additional training burdens.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Motivation: Overcome constraints of small music corpora, unimodal neural data, and non-portable setups in music-based affective computing.

Method: Integrates AI-generated music with EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband, using dry electrodes for portability.

Result: Validated with a 14-hour dataset from 20 participants, showing efficacy in eliciting target emotions (valence/arousal).

Conclusion: MEEtBrain offers a scalable, portable solution for emotion analysis, with ongoing dataset expansion for broader research use.

Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based
affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer
Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for
emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus
Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and
curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings
that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}:
Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights
from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome
setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability
due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these
limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for
emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with
synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the
music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale,
eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use
our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style
and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A
14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to
validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target
emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is proposed to address content hallucination in lyric-to-song generation, using preference optimization strategies like DPO, PPO, and GRPO, achieving significant improvements in alignment and musical coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods for lyric-to-song generation suffer from content hallucination and limited self-improvement, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: A novel RL framework with preference optimization (DPO, PPO, GRPO) is developed, leveraging a hallucination preference dataset based on phoneme error rate (PER) and rule-based filtering.

Result: DPO reduces PER by 7.4%, while PPO and GRPO achieve 4.9% and 4.7% reductions, respectively, effectively mitigating hallucinations while maintaining musical quality.

Conclusion: The RL-based framework successfully controls hallucinations in lyric-to-song generation, with potential applications for music style adherence and generative song research.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated
AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer
from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics
and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained
self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core
challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging
preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions
include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed
via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture
alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three
distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance
positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and
GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to
iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,
yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective
and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress
hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents
a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song
generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music
style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future
generative song research.

Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its
capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality
reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is
accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation
in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at
higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle
multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality
and cross-channel phase consistency.

### [327] [Estimating Musical Surprisal from Audio in Autoregressive Diffusion Model Noise Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05306)
*Mathias Rose Bjare,Stefan Lattner,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores using autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs) to estimate information content (IC) for modeling musical expectancy and surprisal, outperforming a Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) in tasks like pitch surprisal and segment boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the modeling of musical expectancy and surprisal by leveraging the effectiveness of diffusion models over traditional transformers.

Method: Uses IC estimates from ADMs based on diffusion ODEs, comparing them to GIVT in tasks like monophonic pitch surprisal and multi-track audio segment boundary detection.

Result: Diffusion models match or exceed GIVT performance, with improved results at specific noise levels, suggesting IC captures surprisal at different audio granularities.

Conclusion: ADMs are more effective than GIVT for modeling musical surprisal, with noise levels in diffusion processes influencing task performance.

Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative
Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical
expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such
modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We
empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms
of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's
effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1)
capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in
multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the
performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different
diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio
features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we
find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks'
results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.

### [328] [Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641)
*Richard Duong,Jannis Chemseddine,Peter K. Friz,Gabriele Steidl*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A novel flow-based generative model using the telegrapher's equation (Kac process) is introduced, offering Lipschitz continuity and bounded velocity, outperforming diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of diffusion models by proposing a more stable and efficient alternative based on the telegrapher's equation.

Method: Leverages the Kac process, which evolves linearly in time, ensuring Lipschitz continuity and bounded velocity. Extended to multi-dimensions, the model trains a neural network to approximate the velocity field for sample generation.

Result: The model demonstrates scalability and outperforms diffusion models in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The Kac-based flow model provides a promising alternative to diffusion models, with theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model
based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation.
Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac
type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process
in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability
flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to
diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the
Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these
considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of
independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this
process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space
and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point
analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network
that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its
advantages over diffusion models.

*Seraphina Fong,Marco Matassoni,Alessio Brutti*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Speech LLMs for low-resource ASR via the SLAM-ASR framework, highlighting data challenges and benefits of pretrained projectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored applicability of LLMs in low-resource ASR settings.

Method: Uses the SLAM-ASR framework with a trainable projector between a speech encoder and LLM, testing data requirements and pretrained projectors.

Result: Pretrained projectors mitigate data scarcity; multilingual LLMs show promise for low-resource ASR.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing Speech LLMs in low-resource and multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a
trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly,
we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

TL;DR: The paper investigates F5-TTS for dysarthric speech synthesis, revealing biases toward intelligibility over speaker similarity and prosody, and suggests fairness-aware improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in dysarthric speech synthesis due to data scarcity and potential biases in zero-shot voice cloning.

Method: Evaluates F5-TTS on the TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody, using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference.

Result: F5-TTS shows bias toward intelligibility, neglecting speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis can enhance inclusivity in speech technologies.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive
technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent
advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning,
facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may
introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using
TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody
preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like
Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric
severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech
intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech
synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware
dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech
technologies.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a state-of-the-art open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) model for small devices, combining a speech encoder, keyword encoder, and detection network to achieve high accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection accuracy and generalization in open-vocabulary KWS, especially for small-footprint devices, addressing limitations of existing models.

Method: Uses a speech encoder (tiny Whisper or Conformer), a hyper-network-based keyword encoder, and a detection network with a Perceiver module for keyword-specific convolution and cross-attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizes well to out-of-domain conditions (e.g., L2 speech), and outperforms larger models with just 4.2M parameters.

Conclusion: The model is efficient, robust, and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of detecting words
or terms within speech recordings, regardless of whether they were included in
the training data. This paper introduces an open-vocabulary keyword spotting
model with state-of-the-art detection accuracy for small-footprint devices. The
model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a
detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny
Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that
takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of
weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a
keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter
weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the
cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the
target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system
achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our
smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models
that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: JPS introduces a method for jailbreaking MLLMs using collaborative visual perturbations and textual steering, achieving high attack success and malicious intent fulfillment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak attacks focus on bypassing safety filters but often fail to produce harmful content, highlighting the need for a method that ensures malicious intent fulfillment.

Method: JPS combines target-guided adversarial image perturbations with optimized steering prompts, co-optimized iteratively for performance.

Result: JPS achieves state-of-the-art results in attack success rate (ASR) and malicious intent fulfillment rate (MIFR) across MLLMs.

Conclusion: JPS effectively addresses the gap in jailbreak attacks by ensuring both safety bypass and malicious intent fulfillment, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

TL;DR: LLM-powered code generation aids creative coding by focusing on structural motifs, but struggles with diverse code candidates. A predictive model aligns code and audio embeddings to improve musical diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance creative coding (e.g., live-coding) by enabling users to explore diverse code candidates for better musical realization, despite LLMs' limitations in generating unique code variations.

Method: Investigates the topology of code-audio embedding spaces, constructs a predictive model to align these embeddings, and presents a model predicting audio embeddings from code.

Result: Code and audio embeddings lack a simple linear relationship, but a learned alignment map can bridge this gap.

Conclusion: A predictive model aligning code and audio embeddings can improve the diversity and musical relevance of LLM-generated code candidates.

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize
their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present
unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's
audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and
produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and
audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a
simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive
model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the
aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts
output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

Motivation: Traditional Bayesian retrievals are computationally expensive; machine learning offers efficient alternatives for JWST and future observatories.

Result: Performance of ML models is benchmarked; best combination is identified and validated.

Conclusion: Machine learning is a viable, efficient alternative to traditional methods for exoplanet atmospheric parameter retrieval.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from
transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally
computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming
observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives
that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study
of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their
performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission
spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the
accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include
partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors
(KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking
(STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of
different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance.
We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of
planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and
preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of
WASP-39b.

### [335] [Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445)
*Costas Smaragdakis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: QuadrANN, a GNN architecture, learns optimal quadrature weights for non-uniform point clouds, improving integration accuracy for PDE solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds for mesh-free PDE solvers.

Method: Uses a deep message-passing GNN to encode local geometric features and global context, generating adaptive quadrature rules.

Result: Reduces variance in integral estimation and enhances stability in critical areas, outperforming Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: QuadrANN improves deep learning-based variational solvers by optimizing quadrature rules for non-uniform point clouds.

Abstract: Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge
for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC)
methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural
network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating
quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature
weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of
the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer
encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as
well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers
incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the
QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is
permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall
domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,
including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the
solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,
QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in
critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This
enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the
optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based
variational solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the Fed's communication strategies evolved during COVID-19 compared to previous crises like the dot-com and global financial crises.

Method: Uses specialized dictionaries for COVID-19, UMP, and financial stability, combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Comparative analysis of content, sentiment, and timing.

Result: Fed communication was more reactive during COVID-19, with declining sentiment in announcements anticipating policy shifts. UMP communication became a 'new normal' post-Global Financial Crisis.

Conclusion: The study highlights how central bank communication adapts during crises, with UMP communication institutionalized post-crisis.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

TL;DR: LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini are evaluated for automating documentation-to-code traceability, showing strong performance but with limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in automating traceability between software documentation and source code, an area with underexplored capabilities.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs using two novel datasets (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI) to assess trace link identification, relationship explanation, and multi-step chain reconstruction.

Result: Best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4%, outperforming baselines. Relationship explanations are partially accurate (97%), but fully correct ones range from 42.9% to 71.1%. Multi-step chains show high endpoint accuracy but varied intermediate link precision.

Conclusion: LLMs are powerful for trace discovery but require human-in-the-loop design due to limitations like naming-based assumptions and overgeneralization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

TL;DR: LLMs favor third-party libraries for Python tasks, often recommending mature, popular ones, but usability gaps like unresolved imports and lack of installation guidance exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs recommend libraries is crucial for their reliability in programming assistance.

Method: Empirical study of six LLMs by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems from Stack Overflow, analyzing library imports and usability.

Result: LLMs prefer third-party libraries, but 4.6% had unresolved imports, and only two models provided installation guidance.

Conclusion: Improvements are needed in LLM-generated code's dependency handling to enhance usability and reliability.

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GPT-4o mini shows promise in generating file-level logs for ML projects but struggles with overlogging and alignment with human practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in generating log statements for ML applications at the file level, addressing gaps in prior work.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o mini by removing original logs from 4,073 Python files, prompting the LLM to regenerate logs, and comparing position, level, variables, and text quality with human-written logs. Manual analysis of a sample was also conducted.

Result: LLM matched human log positions 63.91% of the time but had an 82.66% overlogging rate. Challenges included overlogging at function boundaries, difficulty in large code blocks, and misalignment with project conventions.

Conclusion: While LLMs like GPT-4o mini can generate logs for complete files, practical implementation requires addressing overlogging and alignment issues.

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

*Lishui Fan,Yu Zhang,Mouxiang Chen,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified RL framework for code generation that evaluates reasoning quality, mitigates reward hacking, and improves final outcomes, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL paradigms for code generation focus on outcome-based rewards, ignoring reasoning quality, which can lead to reward hacking.

Method: Develops LCB-RB benchmark, OD-based reward model training, and P-GRPO RL method to condition rewards on task success.

Result: A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO outperforms baselines by 4.5% and matches GPT-4-Turbo in code generation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns reasoning quality with final outcomes and generalizes to other tasks like math.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault taxonomies fail to address attention mechanism-specific failures, leaving practitioners without diagnostic tools.

Method: Systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults from 96 projects across ten frameworks.

Result: Over half of ABNN faults are unique to attention architectures; four diagnostic heuristics explain 33% of these faults.

Conclusion: The study provides the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models, addressing a critical gap in deep learning fault analysis.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution, aiming for continuous system adaptation.

Method: Represents artefacts in typed directed graphs, applies mutation operators via SLMs, and selects survivors using multi-objective fitness.

Result: Achieves 83% security fixes, 93% COBOL-to-Java translation, 40% latency reduction, and 90% computational cost savings.

Conclusion: EvoGraph offers a practical approach to Software 3.0, enabling continuous adaptation while maintaining control.

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

### [343] [An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034)
*Arabat,Ali,Sayagh,Mohammed,Hassine,Jameleddine*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses dependency management in complex software systems, proposing a semi-automated ML approach to identify dependencies early, with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing dependencies in large-scale software systems is challenging, often leading to delays and inefficiencies, as revealed by a study on OpenStack.

Method: A semi-automated approach using two ML models: one predicts dependency likelihood, and the other identifies exact dependent change pairs.

Result: The models achieved high performance (AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014), with strong recall but room for precision improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively aids in early dependency identification, reducing delays and improving CI/CD pipeline efficiency.

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

### [344] [Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066)
*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence (G-JSD) for positive densities, providing bounds and closed-form expressions for Gaussian distributions, and interprets it as a regularization of the ordinary JSD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the traditional G-JSD by extending it to positive densities without normalizing geometric mixtures.

Method: Proposes an extended G-JSD, derives bounds, and provides closed-form expressions for multivariate Gaussian distributions.

Result: Explicit gap between extended G-JSD and G-JSD, with bounds in terms of other divergences, and interpretations as regularizations of the ordinary JSD.

Conclusion: The extended G-JSD offers a more general framework for positive densities and retains interpretability as a regularized divergence.

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

*Wafeeq Jaleel,Md Ragib Rownak,Athar Hanif,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using SAC with GRUs and DTs improves energy management in HEVs, achieving near-DP fuel savings and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient energy management in HEVs is crucial for fuel savings and battery longevity, requiring adaptive control methods.

Method: The study reformulates engine control as a sequential decision problem, enhancing SAC with GRUs and DTs in actor-critic networks for temporal dependency and planning.

Result: The SAC agent with DT-based actor and GRU-based critic achieved 1.8% fuel savings compared to DP, outperforming FFN-based agents on unseen cycles.

Conclusion: The proposed RL framework with sequence-aware components demonstrates adaptability and robustness, making it suitable for real-world HEV applications.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks,
adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel
consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We
present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We
reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and
enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision
Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal
dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and
generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive
cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show
that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8%
of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test
(HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks,
and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen
drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment),
generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network
(FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in
real-world settings.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A multi-level VQGAN generates high-fidelity virtual H&E stains from mIF images, outperforming cGAN in downstream tasks like nuclei segmentation and tissue classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating mIF molecular data with H&E morphological context is crucial for comprehensive tissue analysis. Virtual H&E stains from mIF can leverage existing H&E-based CAD tools.

Method: A multi-level Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) is used to create virtual H&E stains from mIF images, compared against a cGAN baseline.

Result: VQGAN produces more effective virtual stains for CAD, with superior performance in nuclei segmentation and tissue classification compared to cGAN.

Conclusion: VQGAN is a robust architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, enabling integration of mIF data into H&E-based workflows.

Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep,
spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the
morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) can be very important for
obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a
virtual H&E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate
morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the
vast ecosystem of H&E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze
rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological
analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level
Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity
virtual H&E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a
standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal
cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional
utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures
produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN
provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically,
downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue
classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior
performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the
cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior
architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a
viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and
powerful H&E-based analytical workflows.

*Pouyan Navard,Yasemin Ozkut,Srikar Adhikari,Elaine Situ-LaCasse,Josie Acuña,Adrienne Yarnish,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular ultrasound clips for detecting retinal detachment (RD) and assessing macular status, aiming to support ML model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely intervention for RD is crucial, but ultrasound interpretation lacks expertise, especially in resource-limited settings. No existing ML tools or datasets address RD detection or macular status classification.

Method: The authors introduce the ERDES dataset, labeled for RD presence and macular status, and provide baseline benchmarks using spatiotemporal CNN architectures.

Result: ERDES is the first public dataset for RD and macular status classification, with all clips, labels, and training code made openly available.

Conclusion: ERDES facilitates ML model development for RD detection, addressing a critical gap in automated ultrasound-based assessment.

Abstract: Retinal detachment (RD) is a vision-threatening condition that requires
timely intervention to preserve vision. Macular involvement -- whether the
macula is still intact (macula-intact) or detached (macula-detached) -- is the
key determinant of visual outcomes and treatment urgency. Point-of-care
ultrasound (POCUS) offers a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible
imaging modality widely used in diverse clinical settings to detect RD.
However, ultrasound image interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise
among healthcare providers, especially in resource-limited settings. Deep
learning offers the potential to automate ultrasound-based assessment of RD.
However, there are no ML ultrasound algorithms currently available for clinical
use to detect RD and no prior research has been done on assessing macular
status using ultrasound in RD cases -- an essential distinction for surgical
prioritization. Moreover, no public dataset currently supports macular-based RD
classification using ultrasound video clips. We introduce Eye Retinal
DEtachment ultraSound, ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular
ultrasound clips labeled for (i) presence of retinal detachment and (ii)
macula-intact versus macula-detached status. The dataset is intended to
facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for
detecting retinal detachment. We also provide baseline benchmarks using
multiple spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. All
clips, labels, and training code are publicly available at

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: PoET-2 is a multimodal, retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that improves zero-shot variant effect prediction and supervised sequence-function learning by incorporating family-specific evolutionary constraints and optional structure conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current protein language models (PLMs) regarding mutation understanding and representation quality for protein function prediction.

Method: Uses a hierarchical transformer encoder with sequence context equivariance and a dual decoder (causal and masked language modeling). Incorporates retrieval-augmented in-context learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints and optional structure conditioning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot variant effect prediction and outperforms previous methods in supervised sequence-function learning, especially with small datasets.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centric modeling advances protein foundation models.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural
protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein
sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works
have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does
not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for
protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal,
retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context
learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure
conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2
uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context
ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language
modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and
bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring
variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised
settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning
sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work
highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal,
family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.

TL;DR: Users prefer concise, source-attributed AI responses over verbose ones, as current trends in AI sophistication reduce trust and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how response style in AI-powered search systems affects user satisfaction and engagement.

Method: A study with 10,000 participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems.

Result: Users overwhelmingly favor concise, source-attributed responses, and verbose AI responses reduce trust and increase cognitive load.

Conclusion: Optimal AI communication should be direct, sourced, and transparent, challenging the assumption that complexity equals better performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize
verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user
satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.)
participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we
demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed
responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI
development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley
effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking,
leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that
optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly
sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing
assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead
suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement
and system reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of knowledge infrastructures exposed by LLMs and the need for new models of epistemic authority.

Method: Introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework, integrating infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology.

Result: SEI provides a diagnostic tool for analyzing credibility in hybrid systems, emphasizing coordination over classification.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust alternative to representationalist models, contributing to AI governance and ethical information system design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the
fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence
while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This
paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a
diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid
human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on
stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how
credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal
arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform
theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over
classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of
epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance,
knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering
a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

*Xueyuan Xu,Wenjia Dong,Fulin Wei,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A novel EEG feature selection method (CWEFS) improves emotion recognition by addressing redundancy and channel importance, validated on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional EEG features contain redundant information, hindering discriminative emotion representation and real-time performance. Existing methods ignore latent EEG structures and channel importance.

Method: CWEFS integrates EEG feature selection into a shared latent structure model, preserving local geometry and incorporating adaptive channel-weight learning.

Result: CWEFS outperforms 19 feature selection methods across six metrics on three EEG datasets.

Conclusion: CWEFS effectively enhances emotion recognition by addressing EEG feature redundancy and channel importance, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional
multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial
redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the
extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the
real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective
approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature
selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on
emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various
channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection
models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,
a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume
conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a
shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space
across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this
consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive
channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of
different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The
effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,
compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG
feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance
across six evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Proposes a feature selection algorithm (ADSEL) for EEG-based emotion recognition to handle incomplete labels by integrating adaptive dual self-expression learning with least squares regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dimensionality of EEG features and incomplete emotion labels in open environments challenge model generalization and feature selection.

Method: Combines adaptive dual self-expression learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression to exploit sample and dimension correlations for label recovery.

Result: ADSEL improves label recovery accuracy and identifies optimal EEG feature subsets for multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses incomplete label issues and enhances feature selection for EEG emotion recognition.

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial
research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high
dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently
leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature
selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most
existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional
emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent
subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which
can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection
methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on
correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the
correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with
various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion
recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression
learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a
bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression
learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the
cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the
simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and
dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label
recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FDC-Net, a novel framework for EEG-based emotion recognition that integrates denoising and classification tasks to improve noise robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based emotion recognition methods treat denoising and classification separately, leading to error accumulation and lack of noise robustness. The paper aims to address these issues by coupling the tasks.

Method: FDC-Net uses bidirectional gradient propagation, joint optimization, and a gated attention mechanism with a frequency-adaptive Transformer for dynamic collaboration between denoising and emotion recognition.

Result: FDC-Net achieves high denoising performance (96.30% CC on DEAP, 90.31% on DREAMER) and emotion recognition accuracies (82.3% on DEAP, 88.1% on DREAMER) under artifact interference.

Conclusion: The proposed FDC-Net framework effectively integrates denoising and emotion recognition, demonstrating superior performance and noise robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value
in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical
applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various
physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and
emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which
not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential
synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion
recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly
denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address
these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion
recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,
termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification
Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic
collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition
through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization
strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive
Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based
emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels
were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition
performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the
denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of
96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the
emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net
achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on
DREAMER.

TL;DR: A study uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to help drivers maintain attention during Level 3 automated driving by providing persuasive advice, reducing cognitive load and improving takeover behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Level 3 automated driving reduces driver risk perception, creating challenges for emergency interventions due to high cognitive burden.

Method: The study employs an LLM to deliver "humanized" persuasive advice via visual and auditory cues, triggered by road conditions.

Result: The tool effectively sustains driver attention, reduces cognitive load, and improves coordination of secondary tasks with takeover behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in supporting drivers during multi-task automated driving by enhancing attention and reducing cognitive demands.

while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency
necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a
limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To
address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions
through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions
encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver
behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that
our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive
load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides
insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task
automated driving.

*Debanjan Konar,Neerav Sreekumar,Richard Jiang,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) to study gene-gene interactions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on key genes like APP, FGF14, YY1, and PLD3, to uncover regulatory mechanisms for potential therapies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD is challenging due to its multifactorial nature. Decoding gene-gene interactions can aid in theranostics and therapy development.

Method: The authors use a novel Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) inspired by Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to analyze interactions among key AD-associated genes in the Entorhinal Cortex, using data from GSE138852.

Result: The study reveals intricate gene-gene interactions, identifying potential regulatory mechanisms in AD pathogenesis, which could lead to gene inhibitors or regulators for therapy.

Conclusion: Alz-QNet provides a pioneering framework for understanding AD gene interactions, offering insights for gene expression-based therapies and theranostics.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease
(AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge.
Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the
gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this
article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how
some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol
regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1
($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by
other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in
gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network
(Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the
state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene
interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal
Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed
Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$,
$FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE
microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database
$GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the
progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions,
shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the
pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or
regulators for theranostics.

*Wuqiang Zheng,Yiyan Xu,Xinyu Lin,Chongming Gao,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PaperEval is an LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation, improving novelty assessment and reasoning through domain-aware retrieval and latent reasoning. It outperforms existing methods and shows real-world impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying high-quality research amid growing academic publications, and limitations of current LLM-based methods in outdated knowledge and reasoning.

Method: PaperEval combines domain-aware paper retrieval for contextualized novelty assessment and latent reasoning for deep understanding and comparison. It uses progressive ranking optimization for iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in academic impact and quality evaluation. Successfully deployed in a paper recommendation system with strong engagement.

Conclusion: PaperEval effectively addresses limitations of current LLM-based evaluation methods, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

### [359] [Align-for-Fusion: Harmonizing Triple Preferences via Dual-oriented Diffusion for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05074)
*Yongfu Zha,Xinxin Dong,Haokai Ma,Yonghui Yang,Xiaodong Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HorizonRec is a novel cross-domain sequential recommendation framework using dual-oriented diffusion models for fine-grained preference fusion, addressing noise and instability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-domain sequential recommendation by addressing data sparsity, interest drift, and the limitations of existing align-then-fusion methods.

Method: Proposes HorizonRec, which uses dual-oriented diffusion models for preference fusion, introduces mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval, and suppresses noise.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and robustness on four datasets from two platforms for fine-grained triple-domain preference fusion.

Conclusion: HorizonRec successfully harmonizes multi-domain preferences and outperforms existing methods in cross-domain sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

### [360] [Tool Graph Retriever: Exploring Dependency Graph-based Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05152)
*Linfeng Gao,Yaoxiang Wang,Minlong Peng,Jialong Tang,Yuzhe Shang,Mingming Sun,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), a method that leverages tool dependencies to improve tool retrieval by integrating them into tool representations via graph convolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool retrieval methods rely on semantic similarities but overlook tool dependencies, potentially missing prerequisite tools.

Method: Constructs a dataset (TDI300K) to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies, represents tools as a dependency graph, and uses graph convolution for better representations.

Result: TGR improves performance over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results, with analyses confirming the importance of tool dependencies.

Conclusion: TGR effectively addresses the limitation of independent tool retrieval by incorporating dependencies, enhancing retrieval accuracy and performance.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

### [361] [Scaling Generative Recommendations with Context Parallelism on Hierarchical Sequential Transducers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04711)
*Yue Dong,Han Li,Shen Li,Nikhil Patel,Xing Liu,Xiaodong Wang,Chuanhao Zhuge*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention to scale sequence length in recommendation systems, achieving a 5.3x increase in sequence length and 1.55x scaling with DDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale recommendation systems need effective modeling of high cardinality features. Scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, requiring parallelism solutions.

Method: Proposed context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention to distribute computation and reduce memory usage.

Result: Achieved a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length and 1.55x scaling with DDP.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenge of scaling sequence length in recommendation systems, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sub-ID-level Personalised Popularity Score (sPPS) to balance accuracy and novelty in music recommendations, outperforming item-level PPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS) in reinforcing known content, hindering novelty and serendipity in recommendations.

Method: Repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a finer granularity, integrating sub-ID-level PPS for explicit trade-off control.

Result: sPPS achieves higher personalised novelty without compromising accuracy, outperforming item-level PPS.

Conclusion: Sub-ID-level PPS enhances recommendation systems by balancing relevance and novelty, fostering long-term user engagement.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes Leakage Impact Score (LIS) to evaluate MLLM alignment in multimodal recommendation, addressing challenges of static benchmarks, costly online evaluations, and uninformative metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in evaluating MLLM alignment for recommendation due to dynamic real-world applications, expensive online tests, and inadequate metrics.

Method: Introduces LIS to measure preference data upper bound and shares insights on deploying MLLMs with LIS.

Result: Online A/B tests on Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed show improved user engagement and advertiser value.

Conclusion: LIS effectively addresses evaluation challenges and enhances multimodal recommendation performance.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces M³BSR, a model for multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, addressing challenges like modal preference characterization, implicit behavior noise, and modality noise. It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sequential recommendation accuracy by integrating diverse user behaviors and multi-modal item information while addressing noise and preference variability.

Method: Proposes M³BSR with Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising, Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising, and a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer.

Result: M³BSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses key challenges in sequential recommendation, improving performance through noise reduction and explicit interest modeling.

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

*Bruno L. Pereira,Alan Said,Rodrygo L. T. Santos*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines how logging and sampling choices impact offline recommender system evaluation, identifying biases and proposing reliable strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address exposure and sampling biases in offline evaluation of recommender systems, ensuring reliable model comparisons.

Method: Simulates diverse exposure biases using a fully observed dataset, assessing sampling strategies on resolution, fidelity, robustness, and predictive power.

Result: Reveals how sampling distorts evaluation and provides guidance for selecting robust strategies.

Conclusion: Offers practical insights for improving offline evaluation reliability in recommender systems.

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces KuaiLive, a real-time, interactive dataset from Kuaishou to address the lack of public datasets for live streaming recommendation research. It includes detailed user-streamer interactions and supports various tasks like recommendation and behavior modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of live streaming platforms poses unique challenges for recommendation systems, but research is hindered by the absence of suitable datasets.

Method: The authors collect and analyze KuaiLive, a dataset with 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over 21 days, featuring real-time interactions and rich side information.

Result: KuaiLive enables realistic simulation of dynamic recommendations and provides benchmarks for tasks like top-K recommendation and multi-behavior modeling.

Conclusion: KuaiLive fills a critical gap in live streaming research, offering a robust dataset for diverse tasks and fostering future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

*Yuxuan Tao,Adel Javanmard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled variable selection ensures FDR control under differential privacy using Gaussian JLT, outperforming noise injection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy mechanisms disrupt the exchangeability conditions required for FDR control in knockoff procedures, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The framework privatizes the knockoff matrix via Gaussian JLT, preserving covariate relationships while ensuring differential privacy. Theoretical analysis includes debiasing and asymptotic power characterization.

Result: The method maintains FDR control and statistical power under privacy constraints, with conditions for power convergence to one.

Conclusion: The work bridges knockoff-based FDR control and private data release, showing JLT outperforms noise injection for privacy-preserving variable selection.

Abstract: We introduce a novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled
variable selection. Our framework enables rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control under differential privacy constraints. While the Model-X knockoff
procedure provides FDR guarantees by constructing provably exchangeable
``negative control" features, existing privacy mechanisms like Laplace or
Gaussian noise injection disrupt its core exchangeability conditions. Our key
innovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique
that simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate
isometry for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private
variable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension
reduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample
size and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our
analysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private
knockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the
power of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two
critical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --
enabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis
demonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections
outperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical
power even under strict privacy budgets.

TL;DR: A differentially private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in distributed settings is proposed, addressing privacy concerns and computational challenges with a Newton-type transformation and iterative updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in big data and machine learning, especially with sensitive heterogeneous datasets, necessitate robust privacy-preserving methods like differential privacy.

Method: A Newton-type transformation reformulates quantile regression into an ordinary least squares problem, enabling a differentially private estimation algorithm with iterative updates and a debiased estimator for inference.

Result: The method ensures near-optimal statistical accuracy, formal privacy guarantees, and valid confidence intervals, demonstrated through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances privacy and utility in high-dimensional quantile regression, suitable for distributed settings.

Abstract: With the development of big data and machine learning, privacy concerns have
become increasingly critical, especially when handling heterogeneous datasets
containing sensitive personal information. Differential privacy provides a
rigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling
meaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially
private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed
setting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the
relationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers
or heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to
the non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type
transformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary
least squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private
estimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal
statistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further
propose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid
confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we
propose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for
simultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,
suitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methods in practical scenarios.

Motivation: To address the gap in binary classification for multivariate functional covariates, extending beyond single functional covariate methods.

Method: Develops an L1-regularized functional SVM and an accompanying algorithm to fit the classifier, identifying relevant functional covariates.

Result: Simulations and real-world application show the classifier performs well in prediction and feature selection.

Conclusion: The proposed classifier effectively handles multivariate functional covariates, offering robust prediction and feature selection capabilities.

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional
covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of
considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In
particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine
for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the
classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify
relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from
simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes bias and high-order error bounds in Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging under Markovian noise, using constant step size. It introduces a bias decomposition, identifies a linear-in-α leading bias term, and applies Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation to cancel it, achieving optimal error bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate bias in LSA with PR averaging under Markovian noise, as the leading bias term persists despite averaging.

Method: Proposes a bias decomposition via linearization, analyzes its structure, and applies RR extrapolation to cancel the leading bias term. Derives high-order moment bounds for RR iterates.

Result: RR extrapolation cancels the leading bias term, and the error aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of vanilla LSA.

Conclusion: RR extrapolation effectively addresses bias in LSA with PR averaging, achieving optimal error bounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear
Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging
under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant
step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a
linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the
leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR
averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive
high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error
term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla
averaged LSA iterates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a method that replicates neuronal effects more effectively than conventional filters by introducing fractal recomposition of input spectra.

Method: Proposes fractal frequency mapping, which nonlinearly transforms the frequency domain to excite resonant frequencies optimal for sampling.

Result: The method achieves high sensitivity detection, robustness to noise, and noise-induced signal amplification.

Conclusion: Neuronal functionality can be modeled as a linear summation of spectra over a nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form
enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters,
which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter
weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition
of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies
that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection,
robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model
illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation
of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

TL;DR: The study analyzes time series forecasting methods to predict salt rock creep deformation under varying pressures, comparing deep neural network (DNN) models with statistical baselines. N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others, showing 15-20% accuracy improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing creep deformation is crucial for designing underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials, given salt rocks' mechanical properties.

Method: Used multi-stage triaxial creep data, resampled axial strain datasets, and applied STL decomposition, Granger causality, ADF tests, and wavelet coherence. Compared DNN models (N-BEATS, TCN, RNN, TF) against statistical baselines.

Result: N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others, with 15-20% higher accuracy, effectively capturing temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: DNN models, especially N-BEATS and TCN, are superior for predicting salt rock creep deformation, offering significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods
to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt
rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment
is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for
nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for
their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high
ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined
using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain
datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure
levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including
Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed
minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data.
Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test,
confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and
wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of
deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time
Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against
statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results
demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various
stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a
15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models,
effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.

TL;DR: A framework integrates data-driven methods with classical process models using topological properties and conservation laws, demonstrated via a neural ODE model in inventory control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between classical process models and modern data-driven methods while preserving fundamental conservation properties.

Method: Uses connectivity matrices, network graphs, and sparse deep neural networks to model processes, with neural ODEs learning constitutive equations from data.

Result: The framework successfully integrates topology with learned dynamics, enabling applications like model predictive control.

Conclusion: The approach harmonizes classical and data-driven methods, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for process control.

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND and Med-GRIM improve medical VQA with dense encodings and modular workflows, achieving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VQA models lack precision for domain-specific tasks like medical VQA.

Method: BIND refines embeddings with dense encodings; Med-GRIM uses graph-based retrieval and SLMs for efficiency.

Result: Med-GRIM matches large model performance with lower compute, aided by DermaGraph dataset.

Conclusion: The approach enhances medical VQA precision and scalability, supported by open-source resources.

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker is a unified DiT-based framework for portrait animation that improves lip synchronization and speaking style controllability by decoupling audio and style cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on lip sync or static emotions, often ignoring dynamic styles like head movements, and use computationally heavy dual U-Net architectures.

Method: DiTalker employs a Style-Emotion Encoding Module (with style and emotion branches) and an Audio-Style Fusion Module (using parallel cross-attention layers) to guide animation. It also includes optimization constraints for lip sync and detail preservation.

Result: DiTalker outperforms existing methods in lip synchronization and speaking style controllability.

Conclusion: DiTalker offers a more efficient and effective solution for portrait animation by addressing dynamic style control and computational overhead.

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BigTokDetect is a multimodal framework for detecting pro-bigorexia content on TikTok, achieving high accuracy through expert-annotated data and advanced vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting harmful pro-bigorexia content on social media, which evades traditional text-based detection systems.

Method: Developed BigTokDetect using a clinically-annotated dataset (BigTok) and evaluated state-of-the-art vision-language models for multimodal fusion.

Result: Achieved 0.829% accuracy for primary category classification and 0.690% for subcategory detection, with multimodal fusion improving performance by 5-10%.

Conclusion: BigTokDetect sets new benchmarks for harmful content detection and provides scalable tools for content moderation in mental health domains.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM introduces a frequency-based augmentation framework for polyp segmentation, improving cross-domain robustness and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor generalization of existing SSL methods in polyp segmentation due to domain shifts and limited annotated data.

Method: FPGM learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from labeled polyp edges and aligns unlabeled images' amplitude spectra with this prior while preserving phase information.

Result: Achieves over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in data-scarce scenarios and outperforms ten competing methods.

Conclusion: FPGM enhances cross-domain robustness, offering a clinically viable solution for polyp segmentation with limited supervision.

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how prompting LMMs to verify predictions of vision models improves accuracy, analyzes vision reflection's internal behavior, and shows training-free connectors enhance LMM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the explainability and performance of vision reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs).

Method: Prompting LMMs for verification, analyzing vision-language connector behavior, and testing training-free connectors.

Result: Improved recognition accuracy, insights into textual concept mapping, and enhanced fine-grained recognition without extensive training.

Conclusion: Vision reflection is a promising strategy for robust and interpretable visual recognition in LMMs.

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer improves video-based behavior recognition by leveraging local spatiotemporal features and long-range dependencies, outperforming standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D CNNs lack long-range dependency modeling, while Transformers are computationally expensive. A hybrid approach aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The framework integrates 3D CNN for low-level spatiotemporal features and Transformer for long-range dependencies, fused for enhanced performance.

Result: The hybrid model achieves higher recognition accuracy than standalone 3D CNNs and Transformers, with manageable complexity.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework provides an effective, scalable solution for video-based behavior recognition, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

### [7] [RMT-PPAD: Real-time Multi-task Learning for Panoptic Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06529)
*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Katsuya Suto,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD is a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model for autonomous driving perception, excelling in object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precision and real-time performance in panoptic driving perception by integrating multiple tasks efficiently.

Method: Uses a transformer-based model with a lightweight gate control and adapter for feature fusion, an adaptive segmentation decoder, and resolves label inconsistency in lane line segmentation.

Result: Achieves mAP50 of 84.9%, Recall of 95.4% (object detection), mIoU of 92.6% (drivable area), IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% (lane line), with 32.6 FPS speed.

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD delivers stable, high-performance results in real-world scenarios, with released source code and models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [8] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOPE, a new benchmark to rigorously assess object hallucination in LVLMs by generating misleading distractors, outperforming the existing POPE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks like POPE are ineffective for evaluating object hallucination in advanced LVLMs due to simplistic sampling strategies.

Method: HOPE uses content-aware hallucination searching (leveraging CLIP) and description-based hallucination searching to create misleading distractors.

Result: HOPE causes a precision drop of 9% to 23% in LVLMs, significantly outperforming POPE.

Conclusion: HOPE provides a more rigorous and effective benchmark for assessing hallucination vulnerabilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

### [9] [Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Models on Feature Deficient Astrophotography Imagery Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06537)
*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking object detection models on MobilTelesco, a sparse night-sky dataset, reveals challenges in feature-deficient conditions compared to traditional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) lack sparsity, limiting applicability in non-commercial domains like astrophotography.

Method: Evaluated multiple object detection models on MobilTelesco, a smartphone-based dataset of sparse night-sky images.

Result: Identified challenges in object detection under feature-deficient conditions.

Conclusion: MobilTelesco highlights the need for models robust to sparsity, expanding beyond everyday object detection.

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

### [10] [MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543)
*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MILD, a novel method for human erasing in complex multi-IP scenarios, addressing dataset limitations and spatial decoupling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background interferences due to dataset limitations and lack of spatial decoupling.

Method: Proposes Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), decomposing generation into semantically separated pathways, and introduces Human Morphology Guidance and Spatially-Modulated Attention.

Result: MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging human erasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work advances human erasing tasks by addressing key challenges and introducing innovative techniques.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

### [11] [Statistical Confidence Rescoring for Robust 3D Scene Graph Generation from Multi-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06546)
*Qi Xun Yeo,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for 3D semantic scene graph estimation using multi-view RGB images without ground truth 3D annotations, focusing on robust feature extraction and noise reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D semantic scene graph estimation without relying on ground truth 3D annotations by leveraging multi-view RGB images.

Method: Uses semantic masks for feature aggregation, incorporates neighboring node information, and leverages statistical priors for refining predictions.

Result: Outperforms current methods using multi-view images as input.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively estimates 3D semantic scene graphs without ground truth 3D data, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our
project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

### [12] [Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551)
*Ye Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator enables dynamic performance adaptation in AI models, eliminating the need for multiple model versions by allowing real-time adjustments based on predefined conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting pre-trained models to diverse use cases efficiently, avoiding the inefficiency of maintaining multiple model versions.

Method: Proposes NNObfuscator, a utility control mechanism for dynamic performance modification in AI models, tested on tasks like image classification and text-to-image generation.

Result: NNObfuscator successfully allows a single model to adapt to various tasks without extensive changes, improving resource allocation and supporting tiered access.

Conclusion: NNObfuscator offers a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic model adaptation, enhancing sustainability and flexibility in AI deployment.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

### [13] [Age-Diverse Deepfake Dataset: Bridging the Age Gap in Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06552)
*Unisha Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an age-diverse deepfake dataset to mitigate age-specific bias in deepfake detection, improving fairness and accuracy across age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing demographic bias, particularly age-specific bias, in deepfake datasets to enhance fairness in detection models.

Method: Constructed an age-diverse dataset using existing datasets (Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, UTKFace) and synthetic data, evaluated with XceptionNet, EfficientNet, and LipForensics models.

Result: Models trained on the age-diverse dataset showed fairer performance, improved accuracy, and better generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible, fairness-aware dataset and pipeline for fairer deepfake detection, with open access to the dataset and code.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency,
visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

### [16] [From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556)
*Sarina Penquitt,Jonathan Klees,Rinor Cakaj,Daniel Kondermann,Matthias Rottmann,Lars Schmarje*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

*Simon Baur,Alexandra Benova,Emilio Dolgener Cantú,Jackie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPKD improves vision models using extra training modalities but lacks cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance deep learning models in clinical practice by leveraging multiple data modalities, even when some are unavailable during inference.

Method: Proposed MMPKD, using text and tabular metadata teachers to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model.

Result: Improved attention maps for ROI localization in images, though not generalizing across domains.

Conclusion: MMPKD is effective for specific tasks but lacks broader applicability.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

*Guanyu Hu,Dimitrios Kollias,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VEGA, a novel mechanism using CLIP's image encoder to create emotion-specific visual anchors for better multimodal emotion recognition in conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack psychologically meaningful priors for multimodal alignment, limiting their performance.

Method: VEGA introduces class-level visual semantics via CLIP's image encoder, uses emotion-specific visual anchors, and employs stochastic anchor sampling for robustness.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.

Conclusion: VEGA enhances multimodal emotion recognition by grounding features in perceptually and psychologically aligned representations.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared latent space, improving diagnosis by linking imaging data and text reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal brain imaging and clinical reports for better diagnosis, addressing the challenge of linking objective imaging with subjective text.

Method: Aligns brain subnetworks (as tokens) with word tokens in reports, enhancing representation learning in a shared latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and identifies meaningful connectome-text pairs for mild cognitive impairment.

Conclusion: The method offers insights into Alzheimer's disease mechanisms and supports multimodal biomarker development.

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Surformer v1, a transformer-based model, integrates tactile and visual inputs for surface material recognition, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface material recognition is crucial for robotic perception and interaction, especially when combining tactile and visual inputs.

Method: Proposed Surformer v1 with modality-specific encoders and cross-modal attention layers. Compared tactile-only and multimodal (vision + tactile) setups, including feature-based (Surformer v1) and image-based (Multimodal CNN) approaches.

Result: Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with 0.77 ms inference time, outperforming other models in efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Surformer v1 provides an optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ImpliHateVid, a novel dataset for implicit hate speech detection in videos, and proposes a two-stage contrastive learning framework for multimodal hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks focus on video-based hate speech detection, especially implicit hate. The work aims to fill this gap by creating a dedicated dataset and method.

Method: A two-stage contrastive learning framework is proposed: (1) modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image, and (2) cross-encoders for refining multimodal representations. Sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features are also incorporated.

Result: The method is evaluated on ImpliHateVid and HateMM datasets, showing effectiveness in detecting hateful content, particularly implicit hate.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of video-based hate speech detection and demonstrates the success of multimodal contrastive learning and the new dataset.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextGuard-LVLM is a novel framework using Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to verify fine-grained cross-modal consistency in digital news, outperforming zero-shot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem in digital news verification, which traditional methods fail to solve.

Method: Proposes ContextGuard-LVLM, leveraging LVLMs with multi-stage contextual reasoning and reinforced/adversarial learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot LVLM baselines, showing superior robustness and human expert agreement.

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM effectively detects subtle contextual misalignments, enhancing digital news verification.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

*Kexin Yu,Zihan Xu,Jialei Xie,Carter Adams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-MedGuide is a novel framework using visual-language models for interpretable skin disease diagnosis, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of diagnosing skin diseases due to complex visual features and lack of interpretability in current models.

Method: Two-stage framework: Multi-modal Concept Perception Module identifies features linguistically, and Explainable Disease Reasoning Module integrates concepts for diagnosis with rationales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1 for diagnosis; 76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1 for concept detection) on Derm7pt dataset.

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide bridges AI performance and clinical utility with clear, trustworthy explanations, enhancing dermatological practice.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

*Shilong Zou,Yuhang Huang,Renjiao Yi,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based cross-domain image translator is introduced, using joint learning to align diffusion and translation processes for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning diffusion and translation processes in cross-domain image translation without paired training data, aiming for better global optimization.

Method: Proposes a joint learning framework aligning diffusion and translation processes, using diffusion models to extract clean signal components and a time-dependent translation network.

Result: Achieves improved fidelity and structural consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in RGB and cross-modality tasks.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework enhances global optimality and performance in diffusion-based cross-domain image translation.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

*Wenpeng Xing,Jie Chen,Zaifeng Yang,Tiancheng Zhao,Gaolei Li,Changting Lin,Yike Guo,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural rendering framework improves modeling of view-dependent appearance by decomposing complex scenes into static neural bases and dynamic coefficients, yielding sharper specular highlights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF methods struggle with blurry reflections and optimization instability in scenes with complex specular reflections and highlights.

Method: The approach uses dynamic coefficient decomposition: a static neural basis for material properties and dynamic coefficients from a Coefficient Network, combined by a Dynamic Radiance Integrator.

Result: The method produces sharper and more realistic specular highlights compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The decomposition paradigm offers a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in neural scene representations.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Weihao Tang,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalNet improves micro-expression recognition (MER) by addressing key-frame index errors and enhancing robustness using entire ME sequences and causal learning modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key-frame-based MER methods struggle with inaccurate key-frame indexes, limiting practical applications. CausalNet aims to overcome this by handling index errors while maintaining accuracy.

Method: CausalNet uses the entire ME sequence as input. It includes the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) to focus on relevant muscle movement areas and the Causal Attention Block (CAB) to learn causal relationships in ME movements.

Result: CausalNet achieves robust MER under key-frame index noise and outperforms SOTA methods on standard benchmarks with annotated key-frames.

Conclusion: CausalNet provides a robust and accurate solution for MER, addressing key-frame index challenges and advancing practical applications.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

*Denis Lukovnikov,Andreas Müller,Erwin Quiring,Asja Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores in-generation watermarking for autoregressive (AR) image models, proposing two novel methods using visual token clustering to improve robustness against perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend in-generation watermarking to AR image models, addressing the gap in current research and improving detectability under perturbations.

Method: Two token-level watermarking schemes: a training-free cluster lookup table and finetuned VAE encoders for direct cluster prediction from perturbed images.

Result: Cluster-level watermarks enhance robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks while maintaining image quality, with improved detectability and fast verification.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the limitations of direct watermark transfer, offering robust and efficient solutions for AR image models.

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using line drawings for pretraining improves model efficiency, generalization, and alignment with human vision by focusing on structure rather than appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision systems rely on rich visual inputs, unlike humans who understand sparse representations like line drawings. This work explores structure-first learning for better efficiency and generalization.

Method: Proposes line drawings as a pretraining modality, demonstrating its benefits in classification, detection, and segmentation. Also introduces unsupervised "learning to draw" method.

Result: Models pretrained on line drawings show stronger shape bias, focused attention, and lower intrinsic dimensionality. They also enable better distillation into lightweight models.

Conclusion: Structure-first learning via line drawings fosters efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned biases, offering a robust strategy for vision systems.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMFformer, a multimodal depression detection network, improves early diagnosis by analyzing social media data, outperforming existing methods with significant F1-Score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early depression detection is challenging due to subjective clinical evaluations. Social media offers rich, diverse data for objective analysis.

Method: MMFformer uses transformer networks with residual connections for spatial (video) and temporal (audio) feature extraction, combined via fusion strategies.

Result: Achieves 13.92% and 7.74% F1-Score improvements on D-Vlog and LMVD datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: MMFformer effectively detects depression from multimodal social media data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast pipeline for CGH synthesis using point cloud and MRI data, comparing optimization algorithms and deep learning, with improved performance via 2D median filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for generating high-quality holograms from volumetric data, addressing noise and artifact issues.

Method: Reconstructs volumetric objects from point cloud and MRI data, then uses non-convex optimization (alternating projection, SGD, quasi-Newton) for POH and CH generation, comparing with HoloNet.

Result: Improved performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, PSNR) by applying 2D median filtering to reduce noise and artifacts.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline efficiently synthesizes CGH with enhanced quality, outperforming deep learning methods in certain aspects.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising method that modulates
user-defined waveforms with digital holograms. An efficient and fast pipeline
framework is proposed to synthesize CGH using initial point cloud and MRI data.
This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram
(POH) and complex-hologram (CH) generation using alternating projection, SGD,
and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

*Jixuan He,Chieh Hubert Lin,Lu Qi,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restage4D leverages real-world video motion priors to generate physically consistent 4D content, improving geometry and motion quality over synthetic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models lack physical realism for 4D scene synthesis, while real-world videos provide valuable motion and geometry cues.

Method: Uses a video-rewinding strategy, occlusion-aware rigidity loss, and disocclusion backtracing to bridge real and synthetic videos via shared motion representation.

Result: Demonstrates improved geometry consistency, motion quality, and 3D tracking on DAVIS and PointOdyssey datasets.

Conclusion: Restage4D effectively preserves deformable structure and corrects generative model errors, highlighting the potential of video priors in 4D restaging.

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundBioNet, a SWIN-UNETR-based model, noninvasively predicts IDH mutation in gliomas using MRI, outperforming baselines with AUCs up to 90.58%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional invasive methods for IDH mutation detection fail to capture tumor heterogeneity, and deep learning models are limited by scarce annotated data.

Method: FoundBioNet uses a SWIN-UNETR architecture with Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) modules for multi-scale feature extraction and highlighting T2-FLAIR mismatch signals.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on diverse datasets, outperforming baselines (p <= 0.05).

Conclusion: FoundBioNet enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, enabling generalizable glioma characterization and personalized care.

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

### [33] [VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757)
*Yash Garg,Saketh Bachu,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Lal,Sarosij Bose,Calvin-Khang Ta,M. Salman Asif,Amit Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VOccl3D, a novel benchmark dataset for 3D human pose and shape estimation under realistic occlusions, addressing gaps in existing datasets. It also demonstrates improved performance of HPS methods when fine-tuned on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HPS estimation methods struggle with complex poses and occlusions, and current datasets lack realistic occlusion scenarios. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: The dataset, VOccl3D, is created using advanced rendering techniques to simulate diverse real-world occlusions. HPS methods (CLIFF, BEDLAM-CLIFF) and an object detector (YOLO11) are fine-tuned on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on VOccl3D leads to significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in HPS estimation and human detection under occlusion.

Conclusion: VOccl3D provides a realistic benchmark for occlusion handling in HPS estimation, enhancing performance and serving as a resource for future research.

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

*Zihao Sheng,Zilin Huang,Yen-Jung Chen,Yansong Qu,Yuhao Luo,Yue Leng,Sikai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafePLUG enhances MLLMs for traffic accident analysis with pixel-level understanding and temporal grounding, outperforming existing methods on fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack fine-grained visual detail handling in traffic accidents, limiting their practical use.

Method: Proposes SafePLUG, a framework supporting pixel-level segmentation, region-aware QA, and temporal event recognition.

Result: Achieves strong performance on tasks like region-based QA, pixel-level segmentation, and temporal event localization.

Conclusion: SafePLUG advances fine-grained traffic scene understanding, benefiting smart transportation and driving safety.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

*Noe Bertramo,Gabriel Duguey,Vivek Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffUS is a differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes realistic B-mode images from MRI scans, aiding intraoperative guidance by bridging preoperative planning with real-time imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative ultrasound interpretation is challenging due to noise, artifacts, and misalignment with preoperative scans. DiffUS aims to address this gap.

Method: DiffUS converts MRI scans to acoustic impedance volumes, simulates ultrasound beam propagation via ray tracing, and reconstructs B-mode images with realistic artifacts. It uses differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch.

Result: DiffUS generates anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain MRI data, as validated on the ReMIND dataset.

Conclusion: DiffUS provides a physics-based, differentiable solution for realistic ultrasound synthesis, enabling applications like slice-to-volume registration and volumetric reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

### [36] [Edge Detection for Organ Boundaries via Top Down Refinement and SubPixel Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06805)
*Aarav Mehta,Priya Deshmukh,Vikram Singh,Siddharth Malhotra,Krishnan Menon Iyer,Tanvi Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A medically focused crisp edge detector is proposed to improve organ boundary localization in medical imaging, outperforming baseline methods and enhancing downstream tasks like segmentation and registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise organ boundary localization is crucial for medical imaging tasks, but existing ConvNet edge detectors lack the required accuracy, especially for millimeter-level precision.

Method: The method uses a top-down backward refinement architecture, fusing high-level semantic features with low-level cues, and extends it to handle anisotropic volumes with 2D slice-wise refinement and light 3D context.

Result: Evaluations on CT and MRI datasets show improved boundary localization (higher F-measure, lower Hausdorff distance) and consistent gains in downstream tasks like segmentation and registration.

Conclusion: The proposed crisp edge detector significantly enhances medical-imaging tasks by providing clinically valuable, well-localized organ boundaries.

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

*Vikram Singh,Kabir Malhotra,Rohan Desai,Ananya Shankaracharya,Priyadarshini Chatterjee,Krishnan Menon Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dual-resolution architecture (Our method) for melanocytic tumor segmentation in dermoscopic images, combining full-resolution and pooled streams with boundary-aware connections and channel attention, outperforms baselines in boundary accuracy and clinical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lesion segmentation is crucial for automated skin cancer screening but faces challenges like subtle variations, artifacts, and precise boundary needs.

Method: ResNet-inspired dual-resolution architecture with boundary-aware residual connections, channel attention, artifact suppression, and multi-task training (segmentation, boundary, and contrastive losses).

Result: Significantly improves boundary adherence and clinical metrics on public benchmarks without heavy post-processing.

Conclusion: Our method is a practical solution for automated melanoma assessment, offering pixel-accurate masks and robust performance.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

*Ayaan Nooruddin Siddiqui,Mahnoor Zaidi,Ayesha Nazneen Shahbaz,Priyadarshini Chatterjee,Krishnan Menon Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework for subcutaneous vessel segmentation uses sparse annotations and a differentiable random walk model to generate dense, probabilistic supervision, improving accuracy and reducing annotation burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of scarce, expensive ground truth and low-contrast vessel appearance in clinical images drives the need for a cost-effective, accurate segmentation method.

Method: The framework leverages sparse annotations (e.g., centerlines, dots) and expands them into dense supervision via a learned random walk label propagator. It incorporates image-driven cues, tubular continuity priors, and an uncertainty-weighted loss. A topology-aware regularizer enhances connectivity.

Result: The method outperforms naive sparse label training and pseudo-labeling, producing more complete vascular maps and better-calibrated uncertainty.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotation burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology, enhancing usability for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

TL;DR: SAGE-reID introduces a source-free, cost-effective MSDA method for person reID using low-rank adapters and a gating network for efficient cross-domain knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of adapting person reID models to new environments without increasing computational costs or requiring source data during adaptation.

Method: Uses source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) and a lightweight gating network to dynamically merge domain knowledge, keeping backbone parameters constant.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17) while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SAGE-reID is an effective, scalable solution for multi-source domain adaptation in person reID.

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric
deviations in manufactured components using advanced 3D surface analysis.
Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient
visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We
further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and
probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we
conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The
results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models
while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong
performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for multiview clustering uses cardinality constraints for local information extraction and a low-rank constraint for global structure, solved by an alternating quadratic penalty method with global convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multiview clustering by extracting reliable local and global structure information without relying on Graph-Laplacian regularization, addressing the challenge of nonconvex, nonsmooth models.

Method: Proposes a joint sparse self-representation learning model with cardinality constraints for local information and a low-rank constraint for global structure, solved using an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method.

Result: The model and AQP method outperform eight state-of-the-art algorithms on six standard datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines local and global structure extraction for multiview clustering, with a globally convergent solution method.

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Conclusion: VSI is robust, generalizable, and achieves SOTA in medium-to-long video-QA tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

### [44] [NS-FPN: Improving Infrared Small Target Detection and Segmentation from Noise Suppression Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06878)
*Maoxun Yuan,Duanni Meng,Ziteng Xi,Tianyi Zhao,Shiji Zhao,Yimian Dai,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NS-FPN, a noise-suppression feature pyramid network for infrared small target detection, addressing false alarms by focusing on noise suppression in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to dim, shapeless targets and background clutter. Existing CNN methods enhance features but increase false alarms. The paper aims to improve performance by suppressing noise.

Method: Proposes NS-FPN with a low-frequency guided feature purification (LFP) module for noise suppression and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module for target-relevant feature fusion.

Result: NS-FPN significantly reduces false alarms and outperforms existing methods on public IRSTDS datasets.

Conclusion: The lightweight and effective NS-FPN can be easily integrated into existing frameworks, offering superior performance for IRSTDS tasks.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

### [45] [BASIC: Boosting Visual Alignment with Intrinsic Refined Embeddings in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06895)
*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BASIC introduces direct visual supervision to improve visual embedding alignment in MLLMs, enhancing performance without extra models or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack direct visual supervision for embeddings, limiting finer alignment between visual and textual modalities.

Method: BASIC uses refined visual embeddings from LLM's shallow layers to guide the projector, optimizing embedding directions and semantic matching.

Result: BASIC significantly boosts MLLM performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Direct visual supervision via BASIC effectively enhances visual-textual alignment in MLLMs.

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

*Weiran Chen,Guiqian Zhu,Ying Li,Yi Ji,Chunping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey of deep learning-based Chinese font generation methods, categorizing them into many-shot and few-shot approaches, and discussing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of generated Chinese character images and provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning techniques in font generation.

Method: Literature review and categorization of methods based on reference samples, discussing strengths and limitations of each approach.

Result: Identified two main categories (many-shot and few-shot) and summarized key techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges and future directions to guide researchers in advancing Chinese font generation.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

### [47] [eMotions: A Large-Scale Dataset and Audio-Visual Fusion Network for Emotion Analysis in Short-form Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06902)
*Xuecheng Wu,Dingkang Yang,Danlei Huang,Xinyi Yin,Yifan Wang,Jia Zhang,Jiayu Nie,Liangyu Fu,Yang Liu,Junxiao Xue,Hadi Amirpour,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces eMotions, a large-scale dataset for short-form video emotion analysis, and proposes AV-CANet, an audio-visual fusion network to address challenges in emotion analysis due to content diversity and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-form videos (SVs) are widely used but pose challenges for emotion analysis due to their multimodal complexity and lack of annotated datasets.

Method: The authors introduce eMotions, a dataset with 27,996 annotated videos, and propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network with a Local-Global Fusion Module and EP-CE Loss.

Result: AV-CANet outperforms on eMotions and public VEA datasets, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust dataset and method for SV emotion analysis, offering insights for future research.

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

### [48] [A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904)
*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPF, a training-free COS method that converts generic prompts into fine-grained instance masks using MLLM and SAM, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free COS methods produce coarse semantic masks, failing to handle multiple camouflaged instances effectively.

Method: IAPF uses a three-step process: generating image-specific tags with MLLM, creating instance-level prompts with Grounding DINO and SAM, and voting for the most consistent mask.

Result: IAPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free COS methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: IAPF addresses the limitations of coarse semantic masks in COS, providing a robust training-free solution for fine-grained instance segmentation.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

*Ruoxi Chen,Dongping Chen,Siyuan Wu,Sinan Wang,Shiyun Lang,Petr Sushko,Gaoyang Jiang,Yao Wan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiRef-bench, a framework for evaluating multi-reference image generation, and highlights the limitations of current models in handling multiple visual references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation frameworks rely on single-source inputs, unlike human designers who draw from multiple references. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors develop MultiRef-bench, a dataset with synthetic and real-world samples, and evaluate three image-text models and six agentic frameworks.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with OmniGen performing best at 66.6% (synthetic) and 79.0% (real-world) accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for more flexible, human-like creative tools and provide a dataset (MultiRef) to support future research.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

*Jinhao Li,Zijian Chen,Lirong Deng,Changbo Wang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMReID-Bench, a multi-task multi-modal benchmark for person re-identification (ReID), addressing limitations of traditional models and leveraging multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person ReID models lack generalization in multi-modal data (e.g., RGB, thermal, infrared). MLLMs offer potential but are underutilized.

Method: Developed MMReID-Bench, a benchmark with 20,710 multi-modal queries and gallery images across 10 ReID tasks, testing MLLMs' capabilities.

Result: MLLMs show strong performance in multi-modal ReID but struggle with thermal and infrared data.

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench aims to advance robust multi-modal foundation models for person ReID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

TL;DR: Talk2Image is a multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogues, addressing intention drift and incoherence in existing single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image systems struggle with iterative, multi-turn creative tasks, often causing intention drift and incoherent edits.

Method: Integrates intention parsing, task decomposition across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement via multi-view evaluation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction for iterative tasks.

Conclusion: Talk2Image effectively aligns with user intentions and ensures consistent editing in multi-turn scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: AR-GRPO integrates online RL training into autoregressive image generation models, improving image quality and human preference using GRPO and reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage RL's success in refining LLMs to enhance AR image generation models for better quality and controllability.

Method: Adapt GRPO algorithm with reward functions evaluating perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity for RL-based refinement.

Result: Significant improvements in image quality and human preference across class- and text-conditional tasks.

Conclusion: RL-based optimization is viable for AR image generation, enabling high-quality and controllable synthesis.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large
language models (LLMs), we propose AR-GRPO, an approach to integrate online RL
training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CannyEdit improves text-to-image editing by balancing text adherence, context fidelity, and seamless integration using Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.

Method: Uses Selective Canny Control for precise edits and Dual-Prompt Guidance for coherent scene interactions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods, achieving 2.93 to 10.49% improvement in balance and better seamlessness (49.2% vs. 76.08-89.09% AI-detection rates).

Conclusion: CannyEdit effectively addresses challenges in training-free regional image editing, offering superior performance and seamless results.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first Sign Language Production Challenge to standardize evaluation metrics for SLP, using the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset and a custom test set. The winning team achieved high scores with a retrieval-based framework and pre-trained language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized evaluation metrics for Sign Language Production (SLP) hinders meaningful comparisons across systems, prompting the creation of a challenge to address this gap.

Method: The challenge evaluates Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation architectures using the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset and a custom test set. A standardized evaluation network with skeleton extraction-based keypoints was released.

Result: 33 participants submitted 231 solutions, with the top team achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574 using a retrieval-based framework and pre-trained language model.

Conclusion: The challenge successfully established a standardized evaluation baseline for SLP, facilitating future research comparisons.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

### [55] [Beyond Frequency: Seeing Subtle Cues Through the Lens of Spatial Decomposition for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06959)
*Qin Xu,Lili Zhu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a novel method for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that adaptively enhances spatial-domain features, overcoming limitations of fixed-scale frequency-domain methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frequency-domain methods lack adaptability to image content and cannot dynamically adjust feature extraction for discriminative requirements.

Method: SCOPE uses two modules: Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE) for enhancing shallow features and Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR) for refining high-level features. These are cascaded to combine local details with global semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-scale frequency methods by adaptively enhancing spatial features, improving FGVC performance.

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

*Qiwei Tian,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Qian Li,Shuai Liu,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViPro, the first adversarial attack to promote videos in text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), and proposes Modal Refinement (MoRe) for better transferability. It demonstrates superior performance over baselines and highlights vulnerabilities in T2VR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2VR attacks focus on suppressing video ranks, but promoting videos is more impactful for attackers. This gap motivates the study of adversarial video promotion.

Method: Proposes ViPro for adversarial video promotion and MoRe to refine cross-modal interactions for black-box transferability. Evaluated on multiple models, datasets, and scenarios.

Result: ViPro outperforms baselines by 30%/10%/4% in white/grey/black-box settings. Comprehensive experiments validate its effectiveness and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: The work uncovers a critical vulnerability in T2VR, provides bounds for attacks, and suggests countermeasures. Code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

### [57] [Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968)
*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods (Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT) on real images with >180° FoV, comparing performance across varying FoVs and proposing a depth-based initialization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how fisheye-based 3DGS methods handle extreme distortion in real-world settings and improve initialization for challenging scenes.

Method: Evaluated Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT on indoor/outdoor scenes with 200° fisheye cameras, tested varying FoVs (200°, 160°, 120°), and proposed a depth-based initialization using UniK3D predictions.

Result: Fisheye-GS improves with FoV reduction (best at 160°), while 3DGUT remains stable at 200°. UniK3D enables high-quality reconstruction even in difficult scenes.

Conclusion: Fisheye-based 3DGS methods are viable for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse, distortion-heavy inputs.

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

### [58] [WeatherDiffusion: Weather-Guided Diffusion Model for Forward and Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06982)
*Yixin Zhu,Zuoliang Zhu,Miloš Hašan,Jian Yang,Jin Xie,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherDiffusion is a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering in autonomous driving scenes, addressing challenges of weather and illumination. It uses intrinsic maps and text guidance for control and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex weather and illumination in autonomous driving scenes make rendering and reconstruction difficult. Existing diffusion models lack control and robustness.

Method: Proposes WeatherDiffusion with intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) for high-quality inverse rendering. Introduces synthetic (WeatherSynthetic) and real-world (WeatherReal) datasets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks and enhances robustness in downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion effectively addresses rendering challenges in diverse weather and lighting, proving valuable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

*Fangmin Zhao,Weichao Zeng,Zhenhang Li,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TADoc, a lightweight framework for document image dewarping, modeling it as a dynamic process and proposing a new metric (DLS) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex document structures and high deformation in real-world scenarios, prompting the need for a progressive approach.

Method: The task is reformulated as a dynamic process with intermediate states, addressed by the TADoc framework. A new metric, DLS, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: TADoc shows strong robustness and outperforms benchmarks across various document types and distortion levels.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic modeling and DLS metric effectively address dewarping challenges, enhancing performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

### [60] [OctreeNCA: Single-Pass 184 MP Segmentation on Consumer Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06993)
*Nick Lemke,John Kalkhof,Niklas Babendererde,Anirban Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA, a bio-inspired model, efficiently segments large medical inputs like high-resolution images and videos with minimal VRAM usage, outperforming traditional methods like UNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation tasks require processing large inputs (e.g., MRIs, pathology slices) with global context, but current models like UNets or Vision Transformers are VRAM-intensive, leading to compromised performance.

Method: The paper proposes OctreeNCA, which generalizes the neighborhood definition in Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) using an octree data structure for efficient global knowledge traversal. A CUDA implementation further optimizes VRAM usage and speed.

Result: OctreeNCA reduces VRAM consumption by 90% compared to UNets, enabling segmentation of 184 Megapixel images or 1-minute videos at once.

Conclusion: OctreeNCA offers a scalable, efficient solution for high-resolution medical segmentation, addressing VRAM bottlenecks while maintaining global consistency and speed.

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2-UniSeg, a scalable self-supervised universal segmentation model, and UniAP, a fast pseudo-mask algorithm, to address inefficiencies in multi-stage pretraining for image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised image segmentation models suffer from time-consuming pseudo-mask generation and discontinuous optimization, limiting scalability and performance.

Method: Proposes UniAP for fast pseudo-mask generation and S2-UniSeg with QuerySD for continuous pretraining, leveraging student-teacher architecture.

Result: S2-UniSeg outperforms UnSAM, achieving significant improvements on COCO, UVO, COCOStuff-27, and Cityscapes, with further gains on a larger dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer efficient, scalable, and high-performance solutions for self-supervised image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

*Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Yiwei Hu,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMat is a diffusion-based framework for generating 4K SVBRDFs efficiently, using a CrossStitch module to maintain consistency across maps without heavy modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for detailed SVBRDFs in 3D content creation and the potential of high-resolution text-to-image models inspired this work.

Method: HiMat leverages a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone with a lightweight CrossStitch module to ensure inter-map consistency.

Result: HiMat successfully generates 4K SVBRDFs with structural coherence and high-frequency details, validated by text prompts.

Conclusion: HiMat is effective for SVBRDF generation and shows promise for tasks like intrinsic decomposition.

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

*Tanjim Bin Faruk,Abdul Matin,Shrideep Pallickara,Sangmi Lee Pallickara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraMAE is a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) encoding framework designed to improve spatial-spectral embedding for geospatial tasks, outperforming traditional methods in reconstruction and downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imagery's complexity (200+ bands) challenges existing self-supervised methods like Masked Autoencoders, which struggle with spatial-spectral correlations.

Method: TerraMAE uses adaptive channel grouping based on reflectance properties and an enhanced reconstruction loss with spatial-spectral metrics.

Result: TerraMAE achieves superior image reconstruction and excels in crop identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Conclusion: TerraMAE effectively addresses HSI encoding challenges, offering high-quality embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses.

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for advanced tools to handle complex layouts and multimodal content in scientific PDFs, where traditional methods and direct LLM/LVLM applications fall short.

Method: DocRefine employs a multi-agent system with six specialized agents for tasks like layout analysis, content understanding, refinement, summarization, and verification, ensuring high accuracy and fidelity.

Result: DocRefine achieves 86.7% SCS, 93.9% LFI, and 85.0% IAR on DocEditBench, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DocRefine advances automated scientific document processing by effectively handling multimodal content while preserving semantic and visual integrity.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates
advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding,
summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in
handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks
precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces
DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding,
content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents,
driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of
advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent
system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic
accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench
dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across
various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score
(SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction
Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability
in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity,
and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in
automated scientific document processing.

TL;DR: MV-CoRe improves Complex VQA by fusing global and fine-grained visual-linguistic features, outperforming existing models with 77.5% accuracy on GQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with Complex VQA due to reliance on high-level global features, lacking fine-grained reasoning.

Method: MV-CoRe integrates global embeddings from VLMs/LLMs with fine-grained features (object detection, scene graphs) using a Multimodal Fusion Transformer.

Result: Achieves 77.5% accuracy on GQA, outperforming baselines; ablation studies highlight the importance of object and scene graph features.

Conclusion: MV-CoRe excels in Complex VQA by enabling deep cross-modal reasoning, validated by benchmarks and human evaluations.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse
visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global
embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large
Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including
object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and
reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and
conceptual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS-Med is a novel method for polyp segmentation in endoscopic images, combining graph-based and attention mechanisms to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in polyp segmentation, such as low contrast and indistinct boundaries, hinder early colorectal cancer detection.

Method: FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual-GCN module for spatial and structural dependencies, location-fused self-attention for global context, and a fusion strategy for multi-scale aggregation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across five key metrics.

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med shows strong clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy.

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

*Yueyu Hu,Ran Gong,Tingyu Fan,Yao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeSO is a novel 3D representation combining surfels and octrees for high-quality rendering and efficient compression, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D representations (point clouds, meshes, 3D Gaussians) have limitations in rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility.

Method: TeSO organizes cube-bounded surfels on an octree, each with a texture patch, and includes a compression scheme for geometry and texture.

Result: TeSO achieves higher rendering quality at lower bit-rates than point cloud and 3D Gaussian baselines.

Conclusion: TeSO addresses limitations of current 3D representations, offering a versatile solution for 3D streaming.

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

TL;DR: ForeSight is a joint detection and forecasting framework for 3D perception in autonomous vehicles, outperforming traditional sequential methods by integrating bidirectional learning and eliminating explicit object association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods treat detection and forecasting separately, missing temporal cues. ForeSight aims to unify these tasks for better performance.

Method: Uses a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach with forecast-aware detection and streaming forecast transformers, avoiding explicit tracking.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes: 54.9% EPA, 9.3% improvement, and best mAP and minADE.

Conclusion: ForeSight's unified approach enhances 3D perception, outperforming existing methods without explicit tracking.

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyComm is a hybrid collaboration system for 3D detection that optimizes communication bandwidth and detection performance by adaptively integrating compact perceptual outputs and rich raw observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between detection performance and communication bandwidth in collaborative 3D detection systems needs an efficient solution.

Method: HyComm combines perceptual outputs and raw observations, prioritizing critical data and ensuring adaptability. It supports adaptable compression rates and standardized data formats.

Result: HyComm outperforms previous methods, achieving a 2,006× lower communication volume while maintaining superior detection performance (AP50) on DAIR-V2X.

Conclusion: HyComm effectively balances performance and bandwidth, proving adaptable across diverse agent configurations and communication scenarios.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

TL;DR: AugLift improves 3D Human Pose Estimation by augmenting 2D keypoints with confidence scores and depth estimates, enhancing generalization without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifting-based 3D HPE methods struggle with generalization to new datasets and real-world settings.

Method: AugLift enriches 2D keypoints with confidence scores and depth estimates from pre-trained models, integrating them into existing lifting pipelines.

Result: AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance by 10.1% and in-distribution performance by 4.0%.

Conclusion: AugLift provides a practical, modular solution to improve generalization in lifting-based 3D HPE.

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The study evaluates GANs and DMs for generating synthetic chest X-rays with abnormalities, finding DMs more realistic overall but GANs better for specific conditions. Radiologists' feedback highlights perceptual gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical imaging, especially for rare anomalies, and assess the clinical utility of synthetic images.

Method: Used GANs and DMs to generate synthetic chest X-rays with four abnormalities. Conducted a reader study with radiologists to compare real and synthetic images.

Result: DMs produced more realistic images overall, while GANs performed better for specific conditions like absence of ECS. Radiologists identified visual cues distinguishing synthetic images.

Conclusion: GANs and DMs have complementary strengths; further refinement is needed for reliable use in augmenting AI training datasets.

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

TL;DR: CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network, improves digital mural restoration by maintaining consistent mask guidance and multi-scale feature extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Murals deteriorate due to environmental and human factors, and existing methods fail to preserve artistic authenticity and focus on damaged regions.

Method: CMAMRNet uses Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS) for consistent mask sensitivity and Co-Feature Aggregator (CFA) for multi-scale feature extraction.

Result: CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, preserving structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals.

Conclusion: The proposed CMAMRNet effectively addresses limitations in mural restoration, offering high-quality results and preserving cultural artifacts.

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

*Xuanhan Wang,Huimin Deng,Ke Liu,Jun Wang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAL is a distillation-based pretraining framework for lightweight human-centric vision models (HVMs), achieving strong generalization by aligning patterns from large HVMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large HVMs are impractical due to their size and data requirements. DPAL aims to train lightweight models with comparable generalization.

Method: DPAL uses a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe) and alignment objectives at global, local, and instance levels to distill knowledge from large HVMs.

Result: DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) matches or outperforms larger HVMs and previous distillation methods on 15 datasets.

Conclusion: DPAL efficiently trains lightweight HVMs with strong generalization, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

*Yu Liu,Zhijie Liu,Xiao Ren,You-Fu Li,He Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates short-term and long-term motion intentions, improving accuracy and multimodal behavior modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of explicit semantic modeling of pedestrian intent in diffusion-based methods, which can lead to misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses a residual polar representation for short-term intent and a token-based endpoint predictor for long-term intent, with adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor to refine the diffusion process.

Result: Competitive performance on ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models pedestrian intent and improves trajectory prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

### [75] [SketchAnimator: Animate Sketch via Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07149)
*Ruolin Yang,Da Li,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchAnimator is a novel model for animating sketches by integrating appearance and motion from a reference video, achieving creative motion like 'a jumping car' with one-shot customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animating sketches is time-consuming and requires professional skills, making it challenging for amateurs. SketchAnimator aims to simplify this process.

Method: The model divides sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning, and Video Prior Distillation, using LoRA and Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to integrate sketch appearance and motion dynamics.

Result: The model successfully generates sketch videos that retain the original sketch appearance while mirroring the reference video's motion.

Conclusion: SketchAnimator outperforms alternative approaches, demonstrating effective one-shot motion customization for sketch animation.

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

*Xiaotong Lin,Tianming Liang,Jian-Fang Hu,Kun-Yu Lin,Yulei Kang,Chunwei Tian,Jianhuang Lai,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoopDiff decouples human and object motion modeling using contact points for coherent 3D HOI anticipation, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works ignore the distinct motion patterns of humans and objects, treating them uniformly. CoopDiff addresses this by decoupling their motion modeling.

Method: Uses two distinct branches for human and object motion, bridged by shared contact points with consistency constraints. Includes a human-driven interaction module for enhanced coherence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets.

Conclusion: CoopDiff effectively models distinct human and object motions, improving 3D HOI anticipation through decoupled diffusion and contact consistency.

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multi-scale feature extraction in lightweight networks without sacrificing performance.

Method: Proposes LMF layers with depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure, integrated into LMFNet.

Result: LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art results on five benchmarks with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming traditional models.

Conclusion: LMFNet effectively balances efficiency and performance, showing potential for broader image processing applications.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

*Huihui Xu,Jiashi Lin,Haoyu Chen,Junjun He,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventRR framework improves RVOS by decoupling it into object summarization and referent reasoning, leveraging semantic event structures for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods overlook the semantic structure of referring expressions, especially in videos where event attributes and temporal relations add complexity.

Method: EventRR decouples RVOS into summarization (bottleneck tokens and video-level aggregation) and reasoning (Referential Event Graph and Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning).

Result: EventRR outperforms state-of-the-art RVOS methods on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: EventRR effectively addresses the complexity of video-referring expressions, improving segmentation accuracy through structured reasoning.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration leverages depth information to improve similarity matching and attention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods often ignore depth, leading to poor similarity matching and attention issues in varying depth-of-field scenarios.

Method: DGN combines a depth estimation branch and an image restoration branch, using progressive window-based self-attention and sparse non-local attention for intra- and inter-object similarity.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images.

Conclusion: DGN effectively integrates depth for superior restoration, validated by a new high-resolution dataset.

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised real-world SR method using rectified flow and Fourier prior to model degradation, improving SR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of unknown degradation distributions in real-world SR, where existing methods fail due to the synthetic-to-real domain gap.

Method: Introduces RFDM for degradation modeling and FGDM for Fourier-based structural guidance, synthesizing realistic LR-HR pairs.

Result: Enhances SR performance on real-world datasets, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The method effectively models real-world degradation, improving unsupervised SR for practical scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMB-Net improves image manipulation localization by integrating semantic analysis from LLMs and addressing hallucination errors with ITCAM, while ITIM aligns features and RED preserves boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IML models lack semantic logical relationships in content features, which real images naturally follow. Manipulation disrupts these relationships, leaving semantic clues.

Method: CMB-Net uses LLMs for semantic analysis, ITCAM to weight text features, ITIM for feature alignment, and RED to preserve boundary information.

Result: CMB-Net outperforms existing IML models in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed CMB-Net effectively integrates semantic and visual cues, addressing limitations of current IML models.

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

*Yuqi Han,Qi Cai,Yuanxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid camera calibration method combining generic and parametric models is proposed to address pose ambiguity and improve accuracy, outperforming traditional methods in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline camera calibration methods face challenges: parametric models depend on user expertise, while generic methods lack intrinsic parameters and suffer from pose ambiguity.

Method: The paper introduces a linear solver and nonlinear optimization to resolve pose ambiguity, followed by a global optimization hybrid method integrating generic and parametric models.

Result: The hybrid method improves extrinsic parameter accuracy, reduces overfitting, and handles noise well, excelling in simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid calibration method is reliable and accurate for complex scenarios, outperforming standalone generic or parametric approaches.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a landmark-guided visual feature extractor for visual speech recognition, addressing challenges like visual disturbances and limited data by leveraging facial landmarks and a multi-graph convolutional network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for visual speech recognition are affected by visual disturbances and require large datasets. The paper aims to improve performance with limited data and reduce reliance on user-specific features.

Method: A landmark-guided visual feature extractor is introduced, using facial landmarks as auxiliary data. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network and multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework are designed to combine landmark and visual features.

Result: The approach performs well with limited data and enhances accuracy for unseen speakers.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates visual disturbances and improves recognition performance without extensive training data.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

TL;DR: ASM-UNet, a Mamba-based model, improves fine-grained segmentation (FGS) by dynamically adapting scanning orders using adaptive scan scores, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods struggle with fine-grained segmentation (FGS) due to individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Fixed scanning orders in Mamba-based models further limit adaptability.

Method: Proposes ASM-UNet, a Mamba-based architecture with adaptive scan scores that dynamically guide scanning orders by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations.

Result: ASM-UNet achieves superior performance on both CGS and FGS tasks, validated on ACDC, Synapse, and a new biliary tract dataset (BTMS).

Conclusion: ASM-UNet addresses limitations of fixed scanning orders, offering a robust solution for FGS in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and

TL;DR: MiraMo is a framework for efficient, consistent, and smooth image animation, addressing challenges in appearance consistency and motion transitions with linear attention, motion residual learning, and DCT-based noise refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image animation methods struggle with appearance consistency, abrupt motion transitions, and computational inefficiency, lagging behind text-to-video advancements.

Method: MiraMo introduces: (1) linear attention to replace vanilla self-attention for efficiency, (2) motion residual learning for temporal consistency, and (3) DCT-based noise refinement for smooth motion.

Result: MiraMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating consistent, smooth animations with faster inference, and shows versatility in motion transfer and video editing.

Conclusion: MiraMo effectively addresses key challenges in image animation, offering improved efficiency, consistency, and control, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against

*Fengchao Xiong,Zhenxing Wu,Sen Jia,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve hyperspectral video tracking by addressing spectral interactions, using Transformers and a spectral loss for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook spectral interactions in hyperspectral videos, leading to suboptimal tracking performance.

Method: The paper uses Transformers for band-wise spatial relationships and models spectral interactions via the inclusion-exclusion principle. A spectral loss is introduced for training.

Result: The tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates spectral and spatial cues, enhancing tracking robustness and performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

*Junsheng Huang,Shengyu Hao,Bocheng Hu,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoDynamic4D is a new QA benchmark for dynamic 4D scene understanding, featuring RGB-D video, camera poses, and 4D annotations. It includes 927K QA pairs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and 12 tasks. A proposed spatio-temporal framework outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing egocentric datasets lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, especially for object/human motion and interactions.

Method: Introduces EgoDynamic4D with RGB-D video, camera poses, instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. Proposes an end-to-end spatio-temporal framework using instance-aware encoding and adaptive down-sampling for LLM-compatible token sequences.

Result: The method consistently outperforms baselines on EgoDynamic4D, demonstrating effective multimodal temporal modeling.

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D and the proposed framework advance egocentric dynamic scene understanding, validated by superior performance on diverse tasks.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A collaborative framework (SLC) combines small and large VLMs for efficient personalization, leveraging small VLMs for personalized data and large VLMs for accurate responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are costly and restricted, while small VLMs lack reasoning. SLC bridges this gap for practical personalization.

Method: SLC uses a small VLM for personalized info and a large VLM for integration, with a test-time reflection strategy to avoid small VLM errors.

Result: SLC is training-efficient, supports both open/closed-source VLMs, and shows effectiveness in experiments.

Conclusion: SLC offers a scalable, efficient solution for personalizing VLMs, enabling broader real-world applications.

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

TL;DR: OpenHAIV integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental fine-tuning for autonomous knowledge acquisition in open-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like OOD detection and incremental learning are limited in open-world settings, lacking knowledge updates and requiring supervision.

Method: Proposes OpenHAIV, a unified framework combining OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning.

Result: Enables models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments.

Conclusion: OpenHAIV addresses limitations of current approaches by providing a comprehensive solution for open-world recognition.

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance model interpretability by understanding internal feature representations in DNNs, inspired by neuroscience methods.

Method: Proposes a unified framework using Activation Maximization (AM) for CNNs and ViTs, focusing on intermediate layers and adversarial example generation.

Result: Effective visualization of hierarchical features in CNNs and ViTs, revealing vulnerabilities and decision boundaries.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well across architectures, offering deeper interpretability and insights into DNN behavior.

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynMatch proposes synthesizing images to match pseudo labels for medical image segmentation, avoiding inconsistencies and improving performance in label-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing label scarcity and inconsistencies in pseudo supervision for medical image segmentation.

Method: SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features from the segmentation model, creating consistent image-label pairs without additional training.

Result: Outperforms strong-weak pseudo supervision by 29.71% and 10.05% in polyp segmentation with 5% and 10% scribble annotations.

Conclusion: SynMatch is effective for medical image segmentation, especially in label-scarce scenarios like BSL.

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing efficient architectures with large receptive fields for semantic understanding and detailed contour refinement in real-time segmentation.

Method: Proposes BEVANet with LKA, SDLSKA, CKS, DLKPPM, and BGAF modules to dynamically adapt receptive fields, enhance contextual features, and improve boundary delineation.

Result: Achieves 79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU with pretraining on Cityscapes at 33 FPS.

Conclusion: BEVANet sets a new state-of-the-art for real-time semantic segmentation by efficiently combining large kernel attention and dynamic feature adaptation.

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Conclusion: MobileViCLIP bridges the gap for efficient video-text models on mobile devices, offering speed and performance.

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-page document understanding is challenging for MLLMs, requiring fine-grained visual and multi-hop reasoning. RL's potential here is underexplored.

Method: Introduces EviGRPO, an RL framework with evidence-aware rewards, promoting coarse-to-fine reasoning. Uses a two-stage annotation pipeline and curriculum learning to create datasets EviBench and ArxivFullQA.

Result: DocR1 achieves SOTA on multi-page tasks and maintains strong single-page performance.

Conclusion: EviGRPO and DocR1 effectively address multi-page document understanding with limited supervision, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RORPCap is a retrieval-based method for image captioning that uses object and relation prompts to generate descriptions efficiently, achieving competitive performance with minimal training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object detectors or GCNs, which have issues like redundant information, complex construction, and high training costs. RORPCap leverages image-text retrieval for semantic enrichment to address these challenges.

Method: RORPCap extracts object and relation words, embeds them into prompts, maps image embeddings to visual-text embeddings using a Mamba-based network, and generates captions with GPT-2.

Result: On MS-COCO, RORPCap achieves 120.5% CIDEr and 22.0% SPICE scores with only 2.6 hours of training, matching detector/GCN-based models.

Conclusion: RORPCap offers a faster, efficient alternative to traditional image captioning methods with comparable performance.

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Planner-Refiner is a framework for video-language alignment, refining visual representations iteratively with language guidance to minimize semantic gaps. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity of aligning evolving visual entities and actions with language in videos, especially for long or intricate queries.

Method: Uses a Planner to decompose language prompts into simpler chains and a Refiner to iteratively adjust visual tokens' space-time representations via self-attention.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding tasks, including a new benchmark (MeViS-X) for long queries.

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner effectively bridges semantic gaps in video-language alignment, excelling with complex prompts.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

TL;DR: CoAR introduces a lightweight framework for customized image generation in unified AR models, avoiding costly fine-tuning and overfitting by freezing pre-trained parameters and using minimal learnable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for customized generation are costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting, motivating the need for a more efficient and stable solution.

Method: CoAR employs a Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy to learn subject representations with minimal parameters, alongside regularization to prevent overfitting and language drift.

Result: CoAR achieves superior performance in subject and style personalization, with significant computational and memory efficiency, tuning less than 0.05% of parameters.

Conclusion: CoAR offers an efficient and effective solution for customized image generation in AR models, outperforming existing methods while minimizing resource usage.

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

*Tingyu Yang,Jue Gong,Jinpei Guo,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODiff is a semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal, leveraging semantic guidance and adaptive denoising to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based methods struggle with complex texture recovery and over-smoothing in JPEG artifact removal.

Method: SODiff uses a semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE) and a quality factor-aware time predictor to guide the diffusion process.

Result: SODiff achieves superior visual quality and quantitative metrics compared to recent leading methods.

Conclusion: SODiff effectively addresses JPEG artifact removal by integrating semantic guidance and adaptive denoising, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

### [101] [GS4Buildings: Prior-Guided Gaussian Splatting for 3D Building Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07355)
*Qilin Zhang,Olaf Wysocki,Boris Jutzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS4Buildings improves 2D Gaussian Splatting for urban scenes by using semantic 3D building models, prior depth/normal maps, and a building-focused mode, enhancing reconstruction completeness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D Gaussian Splatting struggles with large-scale urban scenes due to occlusions and incomplete reconstructions. Semantic 3D building models offer untapped potential for better guidance.

Method: GS4Buildings initializes Gaussians from LoD2 semantic 3D models, integrates prior depth/normal maps, and offers a building-focused mode to reduce primitives.

Result: Improves reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%, with a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian primitives in building-focused mode.

Conclusion: Semantic building model integration advances Gaussian Splatting for urban applications like smart cities and digital twins.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

### [102] [Training and Inference within 1 Second -- Tackle Cross-Sensor Degradation of Real-World Pansharpening with Efficient Residual Feature Tailoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07369)
*Tianyu Xin,Jin-Liang Xiao,Zeyu Xia,Shan Yin,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using modular decomposition and a Feature Tailor improves cross-sensor pansharpening by addressing feature-level degradation, achieving fast training and inference without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pansharpening models generalize poorly across sensors, and current solutions (retraining or zero-shot methods) are inefficient or require additional data.

Method: Modular decomposition identifies a critical interface for feature mapping; a Feature Tailor is integrated here and trained with physics-aware unsupervised losses. Patch-wise training and parallel inference boost efficiency.

Result: The method enhances cross-sensor performance and achieves sub-second training/inference (e.g., 0.2s for 512x512x8 images), outperforming prior methods by 100x in speed.

Conclusion: The approach offers superior generalization and efficiency, validated on real-world datasets, making it practical for cross-sensor pansharpening.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

### [103] [DIP-GS: Deep Image Prior For Gaussian Splatting Sparse View Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07372)
*Rajaei Khatib,Raja Giryes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIP-GS enhances 3DGS for sparse-view reconstruction using Deep Image Prior, achieving SOTA results without pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with sparse-view reconstruction due to limited input views.

Method: Uses Deep Image Prior (DIP) with coarse-to-fine optimization to improve 3DGS for sparse views.

Result: Achieves competitive SOTA results in sparse-view reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: DIP-GS effectively addresses 3DGS limitations in sparse-view scenarios without external models.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

### [104] [LET-US: Long Event-Text Understanding of Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07401)
*Rui Chen,Xingyu Chen,Shaoan Wang,Shihan Kong,Junzhi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LET-US is a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension, using adaptive compression and a two-stage optimization paradigm to bridge the modality gap between event streams and text, outperforming existing MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with interpreting long event streams or preserving critical details, necessitating a new approach for cross-modal understanding.

Method: The framework employs adaptive compression, text-guided cross-modal queries, hierarchical clustering, and similarity computation to distill representative event features. A large-scale event-text dataset is curated for training.

Result: LET-US outperforms prior MLLMs in descriptive accuracy and semantic comprehension for long-duration event streams.

Conclusion: LET-US advances cross-modal inferential understanding of event streams, with datasets, codes, and models made publicly available.

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

### [105] [ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07402)
*Rongxuan Peng,Shunquan Tan,Chenqi Kong,Anwei Luo,Alex C. Kot,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicsSAM is a robust framework for image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) that addresses vulnerabilities in PEFT-based methods to adversarial attacks by integrating forgery and adversary experts, along with a lightweight detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based methods for adapting large vision models to IFDL tasks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, degrading performance.

Method: ForensicsSAM introduces forgery experts in transformer blocks, a lightweight adversary detector, and adversary experts in attention layers and MLP modules to resist attacks.

Result: The framework achieves superior resistance to adversarial attacks and state-of-the-art performance in forgery detection and localization.

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM effectively combines robustness and performance, offering a reliable solution for IFDL tasks under adversarial threats.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

*Junyao Gao,Jiaxing Li,Wenran Liu,Yanhong Zeng,Fei Shen,Kai Chen,Yanan Sun,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CharacterShot is a 4D character animation framework that creates dynamic 3D characters from a single image and 2D pose sequence, leveraging a DiT-based model, dual-attention, and 4D Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable individual designers to create consistent 4D character animations easily from minimal inputs.

Method: Pretrains a 2D animation model, lifts it to 3D using dual-attention and camera prior, and optimizes with 4D Gaussian splatting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CharacterBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CharacterShot provides a scalable, high-quality solution for 4D character animation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

*Youqi Wang,Shunquan Tan,Rongxuan Peng,Bin Li,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE repurposes Stable Diffusion 3 and SAM to detect and localize digital forgeries by amplifying inconsistencies and leveraging semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated forgeries threatens digital media authenticity, necessitating advanced detection tools.

Method: CLUE uses LoRA to adapt SD3 for forensic feature extraction, injects noise via Rectified Flow, and integrates SAM for semantic context.

Result: CLUE outperforms prior methods in generalization and robustness against attacks and OSNs.

Conclusion: CLUE offers a parameter-efficient, high-fidelity solution for forgery localization, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/SZAISEC/CLUE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in Vision Language Models (VLMs) from vision and text modalities, introduces debiasing methods (CDA and DAUDoS), and identifies dominant bias sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs inherit gender biases from training data, but the contributions of vision and text backbones to these biases are unclear. The study aims to dissect these contributions and propose efficient debiasing methods.

Method: Targeted debiasing using Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and a novel method, Data Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality (DAUDoS). A gender-annotated dataset and VisoGender benchmark are used for evaluation.

Result: CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%, DAUDoS by 3% with one-third of the data. Both methods improve gender identification by 3%. CLIP's vision encoder is more biased, while PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased.

Conclusion: Identifying bias sources enables targeted mitigation strategies. The proposed methods (CDA and DAUDoS) effectively reduce bias with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

*Yuxin Zhang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yihan Sun,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD) leverages learning bias to filter contaminated training data, improving detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world training data often contains unlabeled anomalies, degrading conventional methods that assume anomaly-free data.

Method: A two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses learning bias to filter anomalies, and Stage 2 trains the final detector on purified data.

Result: Superior anomaly detection and localization on the Real-IAD benchmark, with resilience to noise.

Conclusion: The framework is model-agnostic and practical for real-world scenarios with imperfect data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study benchmarks waste classification models for HCW in Nepal, finding YOLOv5-s as the most accurate (95.06%) but slightly slower than YOLOv8-n. EfficientNet-B0 was promising but slower. YOLOv5-s was deployed for public use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing HCW management challenges in Nepal due to improper segregation and disposal, which risks contamination and disease spread.

Method: Benchmarked ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n, and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold (5 folds) on HCW data. Used repetitive ANOVA for statistical significance.

Result: YOLOv5-s achieved 95.06% accuracy, slightly slower than YOLOv8-n. EfficientNet-B0 had 93.22% accuracy but highest inference time.

Conclusion: YOLOv5-s was deployed for public use with Nepal's HCW standards. Future work includes improving data and local context.

Abstract: The increasing number of Health Care facilities in Nepal has also added up
the challenges on managing health care waste (HCW). Improper segregation and
disposal of HCW leads to the contamination, spreading of infectious diseases
and puts a risk of waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art
waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S,
YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold techniques where we use 5 folds
on combined HCW data, and found that the YOLOv5-s achieved higher of 95.06%
accuracy but fell short few milliseconds in inference speed with YOLOv8-n
model. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took
the highest inference time. A repetitive ANOVA was performed to see statistical
significance and the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web
with mapped bin color using Nepal's HCW management standards for public usage.
Further work on the data was suggested along with localized context.

*Siminfar Samakoush Galougah,Rishie Raj,Sanjoy Chowdhury,Sayan Nag,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURA is a new benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in AV-LLMs and OLMs, focusing on reasoning fidelity rather than just accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV benchmarks overlook reasoning processes, making it hard to distinguish genuine comprehension from flawed reasoning.

Method: AURA includes questions across six cognitive domains, forcing models to use both audio and video. AuraScore evaluates reasoning fidelity via Factual Consistency and Core Inference.

Result: SOTA models show high accuracy (up to 92%) but low reasoning fidelity (below 45%), revealing flawed logic.

Conclusion: AURA highlights the need for robust multimodal evaluation to address reasoning gaps in models.

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

TL;DR: Comparison of Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis, with enhanced Gaussian Splatting for novel view rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, and to explore the potential of Gaussian Splatting to enhance photogrammetry.

Method: Created a dataset of real-world images, built 3D models using both techniques, and evaluated them using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and lp/mm resolution. Enhanced Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis in Blender.

Result: Gaussian Splatting effectively generates high-quality novel views and improves photogrammetry-based reconstructions. Comparative analysis reveals strengths and limitations of both methods.

Conclusion: Gaussian Splatting shows promise for enhancing photogrammetry and has applications in XR, photogrammetry, and autonomous vehicle simulations.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisR-Bench is a multilingual benchmark for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in multilingual and multimodal document retrieval, as current benchmarks focus on English-only or single-page QA.

Method: Introduces VisR-Bench with 35K QA pairs across 1.2K documents in 16 languages, covering figures, text, and tables, and includes queries without explicit answers.

Result: MLLMs outperform text-based and multimodal encoders but struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages.

Conclusion: VisR-Bench highlights challenges in multilingual visual retrieval, emphasizing the need for improved models for structured data and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Motivation: At-home fitness enthusiasts lack expert feedback on form, risking injury or inefficiency. FormCoach aims to bridge this gap with AI.

Method: Uses vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze form errors and provide corrections. Evaluated on 1,700 expert-annotated video pairs across 22 exercises.

Result: Benchmarks show gaps between AI and human-level coaching, highlighting challenges in nuanced movement analysis.

Conclusion: FormCoach advances embodied AI by framing form correction as a human-machine collaboration, opening new research opportunities.

Abstract: Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the

nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By
framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans
and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An improved segmentation model for herbicide research automates species and damage identification, outperforming prior methods and demonstrating robustness under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual visual assessments in herbicide research are time-consuming and subjective. Automating this process can enhance efficiency and consistency.

Method: The model combines a self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical taxonomy, trained on multi-year, multi-country data and tested across devices and domains.

Result: The model significantly improved species and damage identification (higher F1-scores and R-squared values) and maintained performance under domain shifts.

Conclusion: The model is robust and applicable in real-world scenarios, now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline for automated crop and weed monitoring.

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

*Joonghyuk Shin,Alchan Hwang,Yujin Kim,Daneul Kim,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes MM-DiT's bidirectional attention mechanism, proposes a prompt-based editing method, and bridges U-Net and MM-DiT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in editing MM-DiT models due to their bidirectional attention, and to provide insights into their behavior.

Method: Decomposes MM-DiT's attention matrices into four blocks and develops a prompt-based editing technique.

Result: A robust editing method for MM-DiT, supporting global to local edits across variants.

Conclusion: The findings bridge U-Net and MM-DiT methods, offering deeper understanding of MM-DiT's behavior.

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

*Xiaotong Ji,Ryoma Bise,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rejection module integrated with top-rank learning to handle noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances in medical image processing, improving diagnosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis in medical image processing is critical, but noisy labels and ambiguous instances hinder top-rank learning's effectiveness.

Method: A rejection module is cooptimized with top-rank loss to identify and mitigate outliers, using a rejection function to measure deviation from the norm.

Result: Experiments on a medical dataset show the method effectively detects and mitigates outliers, enhancing diagnosis reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves top-rank learning by addressing outliers, leading to more reliable medical image diagnoses.

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

### [118] [Enhanced Generative Structure Prior for Chinese Text Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07537)
*Xiaoming Li,Wangmeng Zuo,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for high-quality Chinese text image super-resolution using structure priors and StyleGAN, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text image SR methods focus on English, neglecting complex scripts like Chinese. This work addresses the challenge of restoring precise strokes in low-resolution Chinese characters.

Method: Proposes a structure prior integrated with StyleGAN, using a codebook to guide character structure and style (typeface, orientation, location).

Result: The framework accurately restores degraded Chinese characters, even with irregular layouts, by leveraging structure-level guidance.

Conclusion: The method provides robust, character-specific restoration, with code and models available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

TL;DR: The paper discusses the MIDI-B Challenge for evaluating DICOM image de-identification methods, highlighting the importance of privacy compliance and data utility. The authors' algorithm achieved 99.92% accuracy, ranking 2nd.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for compliant and effective de-identification of medical images, ensuring patient privacy while maintaining data utility for research and clinical use.

Method: Applied techniques like pixel masking, date shifting, text recognition, and removal, adhering to standards like HIPAA and DICOM PS3.15.

Result: Achieved 99.92% accuracy in de-identification, ranking 2nd among 10 teams in the MIDI-B Challenge.

Conclusion: The study underscores the effectiveness of the proposed methods but identifies limitations and suggests future improvements for de-identification techniques.

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

TL;DR: Proposes a domain generalization method for pathological images, focusing on intra-hospital shifts using contrastive learning at WSI and patch levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shifts within whole slide images (WSIs) due to patient characteristics and tissue thickness, avoiding reliance on multi-hospital data.

Method: Clusters WSI-level features from non-tumor regions as domains and applies two-stage contrastive learning (WSI-level and patch-level) to reduce feature gaps.

Result: Effectively mitigates domain shifts by leveraging intra-hospital variations.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical solution for domain generalization in pathological images without requiring multi-hospital data.

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Pose, a framework using chain-of-thought reasoning to generate 3D human poses from abstract prompts, addressing the gap between high-level language and detailed pose descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-pose models require low-level prompts, unlike human communication which uses abstract language, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: The framework integrates CoT reasoning to interpret abstract prompts and a data synthesis pipeline for training with abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and 3D poses.

Result: CoT-Pose effectively generates plausible and semantically aligned poses from abstract inputs.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes high-level understanding in pose generation and suggests reasoning-enhanced approaches for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fine-grained alignment between video content and commentary in automated soccer commentary generation.

Method: Extends MatchVoice with the GOAL dataset, conducts experiments on training configurations, and explores window sizes for zero-shot performance.

Result: MatchVoice shows promising generalization but requires integration of broader video-language techniques for better performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of MatchVoice for soccer commentary but underscores the need for further enhancements from video-language domains.

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve medical image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data effectively.

Method: Uses Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU learning) to discriminate foreground and background regions on unlabeled images.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in selecting pseudo-labels for various background regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for medical image segmentation using pseudo-labels.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method for medical image
segmentation that can perform learning on ``individual images'' to select
effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU
learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary
classification problems, to obtain the appropriate metric for discriminating
foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning
makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: A study on design choices for fine-tuning MLLMs for visual grounding, using LLaVA-1.5, leading to performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic verification in existing approaches for fine-tuning MLLMs for visual grounding (VG).

Method: Analyze visual grounding paradigms and grounding data design in LLaVA-1.5, conducting ablation studies.

Result: Achieves +5.6%/+6.9%/+7.0% improvements on RefCOCO/+/g over LLaVA-1.5.

Conclusion: The study identifies effective designs for VG in MLLMs, enhancing performance and providing insights for future work.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit supervision for intermediate modules, hindering independent evaluation and training.

Method: Introduces Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS) and a Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) for feature map evaluation. Develops CLIP-FMQE-Net for real-time quality analysis.

Result: Integration of the evaluation module improves 3D object detection performance by 3.89% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances feature representation quality and overall model performance, addressing interpretability and evaluation challenges.

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

*Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Hyunseung Choo,Duc Thanh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE framework improves VLMs' robustness to distribution shifts by dynamically updating a cache of high-confidence samples with adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs degrade in performance under distribution shifts without labeled data; existing cache-based TTA methods struggle with unreliable confidence metrics and rigid boundaries.

Method: ACE uses dynamic, class-specific thresholds to selectively store high-confidence/low-entropy embeddings, refining them iteratively with exponential moving averages and exploration-augmented updates.

Result: ACE outperforms existing TTA methods on 15 benchmark datasets, showing superior robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: ACE effectively addresses the limitations of cache-based TTA, providing adaptive decision boundaries and reliable performance under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper explores LayerNorm shifts in Vision Transformers (ViTs) during fine-tuning, proposing a rescaling mechanism and cyclic framework to improve performance, especially under data scarcity and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LayerNorm's fine-tuning dynamics in ViTs under data scarcity and domain shifts, as current research lacks exploration in this area.

Method: Proposes a rescaling mechanism using a scalar λ negatively correlated to FSR (Fine-tuning Shift Ratio) and a cyclic framework to align LayerNorm shifts with ideal ones.

Result: Experiments show OOD tasks yield lower FSR and higher λ, indicating under-represented target samples. Pathological data behaves like ID settings, favoring conservative updates.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LayerNorm dynamics in transfer learning and practical strategies for fine-tuning, enhancing ViT performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GAPNet is a lightweight network for salient object detection (SOD) using granularity-aware supervision and efficient feature fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavyweight SOD models are computationally expensive, limiting practical use on edge devices. GAPNet addresses this with a lightweight design.

Method: Uses granularity-aware supervision for multi-scale decoder outputs, granular pyramid convolution (GPC), cross-scale attention (CSA), and a self-attention module for global information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD models for both image and video tasks.

Conclusion: GAPNet optimizes feature utilization and semantic interpretation, offering a practical solution for SOD with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

*Sri Raksha Siva,Nived Suthahar,Prakash Boominathan,Uma Ranjan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using phonation data for noninvasive detection of voice disorders, outperforming traditional invasive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice disorders impact communication and life quality; current diagnostic methods are invasive and subjective.

Method: Analyzes phonation data with acoustic features (MFCCs, chroma, Mel spectrograms) using RNNs (LSTM, attention). Data augmentation and preprocessing improve model performance.

Result: The framework provides accurate, noninvasive voice pathology detection.

Conclusion: The tool supports AI-driven healthcare, enabling early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

*Shahroz Tariq,Simon S. Woo,Priyanka Singh,Irena Irmalasari,Saakshi Gupta,Dev Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-P2E is a multimodal framework for interpretable deepfake detection, combining visual, semantic, and narrative explanations to enhance transparency and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in existing deepfake detection systems, which limits their practical use in critical sectors.

Method: Integrates a deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM, visual captioning, and a narrative refinement module using a fine-tuned LLM.

Result: Achieves competitive detection performance on DF40 while providing high-quality, human-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: DF-P2E advances trustworthy AI by unifying prediction and explanation, making deepfake detection more transparent and accessible.

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShoulderShot is a framework for generating over-the-shoulder dialogue videos, addressing challenges like character consistency and spatial continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are crucial for visual storytelling but underexplored in video generation research.

Method: Combines dual-shot generation with looping video to maintain character consistency and spatial continuity.

Result: Surpasses existing methods in shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial continuity, and dialogue length flexibility.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for practical dialogue video generation.

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

*Wenhui Song,Hanhui Li,Jiehui Huang,Panwen Hu,Yuhao Cheng,Long Chen,Yiqiang Yan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaVieID is a local autoregressive video diffusion framework for identity-preserving text-to-video generation, improving spatial and temporal identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the loss of identity information in diffusion transformers (DiTs) during video generation.

Method: Introduces a local router for fine-grained facial structure representation and a temporal autoregressive module for inter-frame consistency.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity personalized videos and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LaVieID effectively preserves identity in text-to-video tasks with innovative spatial and temporal enhancements.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at
https://github.com/ssugarwh/LaVieID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces X2Edit Dataset for image editing tasks and a task-aware MoE-LoRA training method, achieving competitive performance and dataset superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality open-source datasets and plug-and-play editing modules for image generation models.

Method: Constructed X2Edit Dataset with 3.7M high-quality data, used VLM for instructions, and designed MoE-LoRA training with contrastive learning.

Result: Demonstrated competitive editing performance and dataset advantages over existing open-source datasets.

Conclusion: X2Edit Dataset and MoE-LoRA method effectively improve image editing tasks and integration with generative models.

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

### [135] [An Iterative Reconstruction Method for Dental Cone-Beam Computed Tomography with a Truncated Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07618)
*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage method using Implicit Neural Representation (INR) and iterative reconstruction reduces truncation artifacts in dental CBCT, improving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small detectors in dental CBCT cause truncated FOV, degrading image quality in iterative reconstruction due to accumulated discrepancies.

Method: Stage 1: INR generates a prior image with extended coverage. Stage 2: Discrepancy-corrected data is used in iterative reconstruction.

Result: The two-stage approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, enhancing CBCT image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method mitigates truncation artifacts in dental CBCT, offering a practical solution for compact systems.

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

### [136] [SOFA: Deep Learning Framework for Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07621)
*Yunsung Chung,Chanho Lim,Ghassan Bidaoui,Christian Massad,Nassir Marrouche,Jihun Hamm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFA is a deep-learning framework that simulates and optimizes atrial fibrillation ablation procedures to predict and reduce recurrence risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atrial fibrillation ablation outcomes vary widely, and current methods struggle to evaluate and improve efficacy due to complex patient-specific factors.

Method: SOFA uses a deep-learning framework to simulate post-ablation scar formation from pre-ablation LGE-MRI and procedural parameters, predicts recurrence risk, and optimizes parameters to minimize risk.

Result: SOFA accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and reduces predicted recurrence risk by 22.18%.

Conclusion: SOFA is the first framework integrating simulation, prediction, and optimization for personalized AF ablation, offering a novel tool for improving procedural outcomes.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based post-processing pipeline using GNNs improves object detection by leveraging spatial relationships, boosting mAP@50 by up to 4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors fail to use spatial consistency in static environments, leading to errors in cluttered or occluded scenes.

Method: Proposes a GNN-based pipeline to model spatial relationships and correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames.

Result: Incorporating spatial reasoning improves detection, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.

Conclusion: Spatial structure can enhance reliability in object detection systems.

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

*Junxiao Xue,Xiaozhen Liu,Jie Wang,Xuecheng Wu,Bin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TER, a trusted emotion recognition method using uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions, outperforming others in accuracy and trusted performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on performance but lack reliability for noisy or out-of-distribution data.

Method: TER uses uncertainty estimation to calculate prediction confidence, combining multimodal results based on confidence values. Introduces trusted precision, recall, Acc., and F1 score for evaluation.

Result: TER achieves 82.40% Acc. on Music-video and trusted F1 scores of 0.7511 (IEMOCAP) and 0.9035 (Music-video).

Conclusion: TER enhances reliability and robustness, validated by superior performance and trusted metrics.

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511
and 0.9035, respectively.

*Dejie Yang,Zijing Zhao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-VRM improves robot manipulation by explicitly imitating human actions from hand keypoints, outperforming previous methods in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) lack generalization due to reliance on web data or implicit training. AR-VRM addresses this by leveraging human action videos for explicit learning.

Method: Proposes a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining to learn human action knowledge and an Analogical Reasoning (AR) map for robot imitation.

Result: Achieves leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world experiments, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Explicitly imitating human actions via keypoints enhances robot manipulation under data scarcity.

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

### [140] [LaRender: Training-Free Occlusion Control in Image Generation via Latent Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07647)
*Xiaohang Zhan,Dingming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for precise occlusion control in image generation using volume rendering principles in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precision in controlling occlusion relationships between objects in generated images.

Method: Leverages volume rendering principles in latent space of a pre-trained diffusion model to control occlusion without retraining.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in occlusion accuracy and enables diverse effects like transparency and light intensity adjustments.

Conclusion: The method provides accurate occlusion control and versatile image effects without model retraining.

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

### [141] [Collaborative Learning of Scattering and Deep Features for SAR Target Recognition with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07656)
*Yimin Fu,Zhunga Liu,Dongxiu Guo,Longfei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLSDF, a method for SAR ATR with noisy labels, combining scattering and deep features, using GMMs for label division, and semi-supervised learning for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled SAR data is hard to acquire due to expert knowledge requirements, leading to noisy labels and degraded ATR performance. Existing methods focus on image data, which is insufficient for SAR.

Method: CLSDF integrates scattering and deep features, models loss distribution with GMMs to divide clean/noisy labels, and uses semi-supervised learning with joint distribution alignment.

Result: Experiments on MSTAR dataset show state-of-the-art performance under various label noise conditions.

Conclusion: CLSDF effectively addresses noisy label challenges in SAR ATR by leveraging multi-feature fusion and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UR-VTON is a training-free framework for virtual try-on, addressing long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions by decomposing the process into 'undress-to-redress' steps, improving realism and detail fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions due to inaccurate skin restoration, limiting realism in outputs.

Method: UR-VTON uses an 'undress-to-redress' mechanism, Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance, and Structural Refiner to enhance detail and quality.

Result: UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detail preservation and image quality.

Conclusion: UR-VTON offers a practical, training-free solution for realistic VTON, especially in challenging conversions.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Chaohong Guo,Xun Mo,Yongwei Nie,Xuemiao Xu,Chao Xu,Fei Yu,Chengjiang Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAR-TVG introduces timestamp anchors to improve reasoning quality in Temporal Video Grounding, using a three-stage training strategy for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning approaches lack explicit constraints on reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal temporal predictions.

Method: Proposes TAR-TVG with timestamp anchors for intermediate supervision and a self-distillation training strategy (GRPO, SFT, GRPO).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with interpretable, progressively refined reasoning chains.

Conclusion: TAR-TVG enhances reasoning quality and prediction accuracy in TVG through explicit supervision and efficient training.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

TL;DR: A tuning-free, plug-and-play method for aligning edited 3D assets with original geometry, improving multi-view consistency and mesh quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for personalized 3D content editing is growing, but existing 2D tools degrade 3D quality when applied directly.

Method: Proposes a geometry preservation module and injection switcher to align edited assets with original geometry in a single inference run.

Result: Consistently improves multi-view consistency and mesh quality across various diffusion models and editing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively preserves geometry while enhancing edited 3D content, addressing a key challenge in 3D generation.

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Motivation: Biases in 3DGS arise when Gaussian normal vectors align within a single-view projection plane, leading to inconsistencies in nearby views. The goal is to enhance multi-view geometric accuracy.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, improving surface reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses multi-view challenges in 3DGS, enhancing reconstruction quality for small indoor and outdoor scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of datasets for fine-grained door detection, critical for applications like building compliance and indoor scene understanding.

Method: Uses a deep object detector for unified door detection, an LLM for classification based on visual/contextual features, and human-in-the-loop for quality assurance.

Result: Produces a high-quality dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex domains.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

*Daoping Zhang,Xue-Cheng Tai,Lok Ming Lui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a star-shape segmentation model using a registration framework and level set representation, enabling full/partial segmentation with single/multiple centers and landmark constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in accurate image segmentation due to occlusions, obscurities, or noise by leveraging star-shape priors.

Method: Combines level set representation with registration framework, imposes constraints on deformed level set function, and uses the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation on synthetic and real images.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles star-shape segmentation with flexibility for full/partial shapes and landmark constraints.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriReWeight improves generative data augmentation by re-weighting noisy images, outperforming SOTA methods by 7.9% on natural and 3.4% on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited dataset sizes in applications like medical diagnosis hinder model performance, and noisy images from generative models exacerbate this issue.

Method: Developed TriReWeight, a triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method, theoretically analyzed three supervision types for generated images.

Result: TriReWeight outperforms SOTA methods by 7.9% on natural and 3.4% on medical datasets, with optimal generalization.

Conclusion: TriReWeight effectively enhances generative data augmentation without performance downgrade, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

*Junhyuk So,Juncheol Shin,Hyunho Kook,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD) accelerates autoregressive image models by 3.7x without additional training, addressing redundancy in image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models are slow due to sequential inference; existing speculative decoding methods are either modest or require training.

Method: Proposes GSD, a training-free method that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens instead of single tokens, using dynamic clustering.

Result: GSD achieves a 3.7x speedup while preserving image quality, outperforming traditional speculative decoding.

Conclusion: GSD effectively leverages image token redundancy for faster inference, offering a practical solution for AR image models.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Inversion is a novel method for extracting common concepts from small image sets without relying on additional guidance, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on manual guidance (e.g., text prompts or masks), which can degrade generation quality by failing to fully separate auxiliary features.

Method: The approach uses contrastive learning to train target and auxiliary text tokens, followed by disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning for better concept fidelity.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in concept representation and editing, achieving high-level performance.

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion effectively identifies and represents common concepts without additional guidance, enhancing image generation quality.

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

TL;DR: CAV-SAM adapts SAM2 for downstream tasks by treating reference-target pairs as pseudo videos, improving segmentation performance by over 5% without extensive meta-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reference segmentation methods rely on costly meta-learning; CAV-SAM offers a lightweight alternative.

Method: Represents reference-target pairs as pseudo videos, using SAM2's iVOS capabilities with DBST and TTGA modules.

Result: Achieves over 5% improvement in segmentation performance compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: CAV-SAM provides an efficient, high-performing solution for adapting vision models to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniSVG, a dataset for training Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand and generate SVG, addressing challenges in precision and multi-modal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) is challenging due to the precision required and diverse conditional constraints. MLLMs show potential for these tasks.

Method: Proposes UniSVG, a 525k-item dataset for MLLM training, enabling unified SVG generation and understanding. Evaluates performance on open-source MLLMs.

Result: Training on UniSVG improves MLLM performance on SVG U&G tasks, outperforming SOTA models like GPT-4V.

Conclusion: UniSVG unlocks MLLM capabilities for SVG tasks, providing a comprehensive dataset and tools for future research.

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream4D introduces a novel framework combining controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction to synthesize spatiotemporally coherent 4D content, outperforming existing methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with maintaining view consistency and handling complex dynamics in large-scale environments, creating a need for improved 4D content synthesis.

Method: Dream4D uses a two-stage architecture: predicting camera trajectories from a single image via few-shot learning, then generating multi-view sequences with a pose-conditioned diffusion process, and finally converting them into a 4D representation.

Result: The framework leverages temporal priors and geometric awareness, achieving higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) than existing methods.

Conclusion: Dream4D successfully bridges the gap in 4D content synthesis by integrating video generation and neural reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

*Lei Wang,Shiming Chen,Guo-Sen Xie,Ziming Hong,Chaojian Yu,Qinmu Peng,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prototype-guided curriculum learning framework (CLZSL) improves Zero-Shot Learning by addressing instance-level mismatches and class-level imprecision in semantic prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic prototypes in ZSL are manually defined, leading to noisy supervision due to instance-level mismatches and class-level imprecision, which hinder effective knowledge transfer.

Method: CLZSL uses a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module to prioritize well-aligned samples and a Prototype Update (PUP) module to dynamically refine class-level prototypes.

Result: Experiments on AWA2, SUN, and CUB datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: CLZSL enhances visual-semantic mapping by mitigating prototype-related issues, improving ZSL performance.

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for robustly modeling and extrapolating 3D rotation trajectories using Neural Controlled Differential Equations and $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths, addressing challenges like unknown dynamics and noisy observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in $SO(3)$ extrapolation include unknown dynamics (e.g., moment of inertia), non-conservative forces, and noisy observations. Existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions like energy conservation, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The approach uses Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths to model trajectories on the 3D rotation manifold, avoiding assumptions about energy or momentum conservation.

Result: The method achieves robust extrapolation in simulations and real-world scenarios, handling unknown physical parameters and noisy inputs effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is versatile, integrates easily into existing pipelines, and generalizes well to complex, non-inertial systems, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a snippet-based approach for gait recognition, addressing limitations of set and sequence methods by incorporating multi-scale temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Set-based and sequence-based gait recognition methods have limitations in capturing short-range and long-range temporal dependencies, respectively.

Method: The paper introduces a snippet-based approach, representing gait as individualized actions (snippets) and focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet Modeling.

Result: The method achieves 77.5% rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D convolution-based backbone.

Conclusion: The snippet-based approach effectively addresses gait recognition challenges and demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

### [157] [Boosting Active Defense Persistence: A Two-Stage Defense Framework Combining Interruption and Poisoning Against Deepfake](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07795)
*Hongrui Zheng,Yuezun Li,Liejun Wang,Yunfeng Diao,Zhiqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF) to counter deepfake threats by distorting forged content and disrupting attackers' retraining pipelines, ensuring long-term defense persistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active defense strategies against deepfakes lack persistence, as attackers can bypass them by retraining models on protected samples.

Method: The TSDF uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to distort forged content and poison the attackers' data preparation process, preventing model adaptation.

Result: Experiments show TSDF maintains strong dual defense capabilities, unlike traditional methods that degrade under adversarial retraining.

Conclusion: TSDF enhances the persistence of active defense against deepfakes by combining distortion and data poisoning.

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of power batteries is inefficient, and traditional vision algorithms fail due to dense plates, low contrast, and imaging artifacts. A robust automated solution is needed.

Method: The authors develop PBD5K, a dataset with 5,000 X-ray images, and propose MDCNeXt, a model integrating multi-dimensional clues (point, line, count) with state space modules for improved segmentation.

Result: MDCNeXt effectively localizes dense endpoints and suppresses visual interference, aided by a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy.

Conclusion: The work advances power battery inspection by providing a scalable benchmark and a robust model, encouraging further research in this domain.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

TL;DR: MambaTrans, a multimodal fusion image translator, improves downstream task performance by adapting fused images to models trained on visible images, using text and mask inputs to enhance visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models trained on visible images perform poorly with multimodal fused images due to pixel distribution differences. Adapting these images for better downstream task performance is needed.

Method: Proposes MambaTrans, which uses multimodal large language model descriptions and semantic segmentation masks. It employs a Multi-Model State Space Block for cross-attention and long-term dependency capture.

Result: Experiments show MambaTrans effectively enhances multimodal image performance in downstream tasks without modifying pre-trained model parameters.

Conclusion: MambaTrans successfully bridges the gap between multimodal fused images and models trained on visible images, improving task performance.

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: Pose-RFT is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for 3D human pose generation in MLLMs, using hybrid action reinforcement learning (HyGRPO) to improve spatial and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-specific MLLMs struggle with ambiguity and task-specific alignment in 3D pose generation due to supervised training objectives.

Method: Proposes Pose-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework with HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm for joint optimization of discrete language and continuous pose generation.

Result: Outperforms existing pose-specific MLLMs on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating improved spatial and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Pose-RFT validates hybrid action reinforcement fine-tuning as effective for accurate 3D pose generation.

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

*Sicheng Gao,Nancy Mehta,Zongwei Wu,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTVR is a zero-shot video restoration framework using a diffusion transformer with trajectory-aware attention and a wavelet-guided sampler, achieving superior temporal consistency and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods produce unrealistic details and need paired datasets, while generative diffusion models struggle with temporal consistency.

Method: DiTVR combines a diffusion transformer with trajectory-aware attention and a flow-consistent sampler, focusing on temporal dynamics and motion correspondences.

Result: DiTVR sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art on benchmarks, excelling in temporal consistency, detail preservation, and robustness to noise/occlusions.

Conclusion: DiTVR effectively addresses challenges in video restoration, outperforming existing methods without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

*Jingze Gai,Changchun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2M2-SAR, a semi-supervised method for SAR-optical image matching, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to overcome annotation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of SAR-optical image pairs is time-consuming and complex, limiting the availability of labeled data.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised pipeline (S2M2-SAR) using pseudo-labeling of unlabeled pairs and a cross-modal feature enhancement module.

Result: S2M2-SAR outperforms semi-supervised methods and rivals fully supervised state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and practical, addressing the scarcity of labeled data while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

*Chenyue Song,Chen Hui,Haiqi Zhu,Feng Jiang,Yachun Mi,Wei Zhang,Shaohui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSFIQA is a fine-grained NR-IQA model that uses SAM for semantic region partitioning and MLLM for distortion perception, enhanced by a Region-Aware Semantic Attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-IQA methods lack sensitivity to local quality variations or fail to capture semantically salient regions.

Method: Uses SAM for dynamic image partitioning, MLLM for distortion perception, and RSA for attention aggregation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RSFIQA is robust, effective, and adaptable to various architectures.

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with ZSAD due to lacking local inductive biases and inflexible feature fusion, limiting their performance in dense prediction tasks.

Method: The framework integrates Conv-LoRA for fine-grained representation and Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) for adaptive cross-modal fusion.

Result: Experiments show superior accuracy and robustness on industrial and medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The co-design approach effectively adapts foundation models to dense perception tasks like ZSAD.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

TL;DR: MIMIC is a framework to visualize internal representations of Vision Language Models (VLMs) by synthesizing visual concepts, enhancing transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are complex and hard to interpret, limiting transparency and trust in their outputs.

Method: MIMIC uses joint VLM-based inversion and feature alignment, with regularizers for spatial alignment, image smoothness, and semantic realism.

Result: MIMIC successfully inverts visual concepts from VLM outputs, evaluated using visual and semantic metrics.

Conclusion: MIMIC is the first approach to visually interpret VLM concepts, improving model transparency.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores annotation-free adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology using domain-relevant image-caption pairs, improving zero-shot and few-shot performance without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs like CONCH and QuiltNet may underperform in specific histopathology tasks, and supervised fine-tuning requires manual labels. This work aims to adapt VLMs without annotations.

Method: Continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant image-caption pairs from existing databases, tested on CONCH and QuiltNet across three tasks.

Result: The method enhances zero-shot and few-shot performance, matching few-shot methods with larger training sizes while avoiding manual labeling.

Conclusion: Annotation-free continued pretraining is effective, task-agnostic, and a promising approach for adapting VLMs to histopathology tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: A modular Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE) system improves BEV perception for autonomous driving by dynamically selecting expert paths, outperforming single-expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal BEV methods have limitations in adaptability, modeling capacity, and generalization.

Method: Proposes CBDES MoE, a hierarchically decoupled architecture with a Self-Attention Router for dynamic expert selection.

Result: Achieves 1.6-point mAP and 4.1-point NDS improvements over single-expert models on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: CBDES MoE is effective and practical for enhancing BEV perception in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: Deep SWM, a deep state space model with a sparse masked autoencoder, improves solar flare prediction by handling long-range spatio-temporal dependencies and outperforms baselines and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar flare prediction is critical for infrastructure protection, but current methods lack representation learning or struggle with temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes Deep SWM, using multiple deep state space models and a two-phase masking pretraining strategy for solar images. Introduces FlareBench for validation.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods and human experts in performance and reliability.

Conclusion: Deep SWM advances solar flare prediction with improved modeling and a new benchmark.

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ion beam irradiation parameters affect the morphological properties of Ge surfaces.

Method: Processed electron microscopy images into skeleton graphs, embedded them with a graph convolutional network, and analyzed embeddings using PCA and Davies-Bouldin index.

Result: Irradiation angle has a more significant impact on Ge surface morphology than irradiation fluence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of irradiation angle in controlling Ge surface microstructures.

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge
surfaces by ion beam irradiation were processed to extract topological features
as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional
network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component
analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated
using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in
irradiation angle have a more significant impact on the morphological
properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like dynamic tissue motion and limited field of view in minimally invasive surgery necessitate accurate tissue tracking for improved safety and robotic assistance.

Method: Leverages two CoTracker models (temporal tracking and stereo matching) to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images, tested on synthetic and chicken tissue phantoms.

Result: Achieved Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at 10 mm/s velocity, with more reliable results on chicken tissue.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of TAP-based models for accurate, markerless 3D tracking in surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for

TL;DR: Being-M0.5 is a real-time, controllable VLMM for human motion generation, addressing five key limitations in existing models. It uses HuMo100M, a large dataset, and introduces part-aware residual quantization for precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMMs lack controllability in motion generation, hindering practical use. The paper aims to overcome these limitations for real-world applications.

Method: The approach leverages HuMo100M, a comprehensive dataset, and introduces part-aware residual quantization for motion tokenization to enable fine-grained control.

Result: Being-M0.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion generation tasks and operates in real-time.

Conclusion: The paper presents significant advances in motion generation, with HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 paving the way for practical adoption.

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

*Yanshu Li,Jianjiang Yang,Zhennan Shen,Ligong Han,Haoyan Xu,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATP, a training-free pruning method, improves efficiency and performance in multimodal in-context learning by adaptively pruning redundant image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods overlook multimodal in-context learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is critical, leading to unstable performance.

Method: CATP performs progressive pruning in two stages to account for cross-modal interactions, removing 77.8% of image tokens.

Result: CATP achieves a 0.6% performance gain and reduces inference latency by 10.78% on average across four LVLMs and eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: CATP enhances the practical value of multimodal ICL and sets a foundation for future work in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

### [173] [Selective Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07877)
*WonJun Moon,Hyun Seok Seong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for weakly supervised affordance grounding (WSAG) that uses selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives to learn affordance-relevant cues at part and object levels, improving accuracy by focusing on meaningful affordance regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans intuitively identify functional parts of objects without pixel-level annotations, but existing models often rely on classification and focus on irrelevant patterns. The goal is to improve affordance grounding by learning from complementary perspectives.

Method: The approach leverages CLIP to identify action-associated objects in egocentric and exocentric images, then cross-references these to pinpoint part-level affordance cues. It uses selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives to distinguish affordance-relevant regions from irrelevant context.

Result: The method effectively shifts activation from irrelevant areas to meaningful affordance cues, demonstrating improved performance in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances WSAG by adaptively learning affordance-relevant cues, outperforming previous methods that rely on classification alone.

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework uses task-aware enhanced prompts to handle various adverse weather degradations, reducing parameter overhead while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing All-in-One image restoration methods suffer from high parameter overhead and overlook inter-task relatedness.

Method: A two-stage training paradigm (pretraining and prompt-tuning) with task-aware enhanced prompts, using low-rank decomposition and contrastive constraints.

Result: Achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters, validated by t-SNE analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently addresses multiple restoration tasks with minimal parameters, leveraging task-aware prompts for better performance.

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

*Bowen Xue,Qixin Yan,Wenjing Wang,Hao Liu,Chen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stand-In is a lightweight, plug-and-play framework for identity-preserving video generation, using minimal additional parameters and outperforming full-parameter methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identity-preserving video generation are resource-intensive and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools.

Method: Introduces a conditional image branch into a pre-trained video model, using restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, trained with only 2000 pairs.

Result: Achieves high video quality and identity preservation with ~1% additional parameters, outperforming full-parameter methods.

Conclusion: Stand-In is efficient, versatile, and compatible with various tasks like subject-driven generation, pose-referenced generation, stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

*Marco Peer,Anna Scius-Bertrand,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-training method using CTC alignment improves handwritten text recognition for historical documents by addressing hyphenation errors, with iterative training enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle annotation errors, especially hyphenation, in historical documents like the Bullinger correspondence, improving recognition accuracy.

Method: Uses a CTC alignment algorithm with dynamic programming and model output probabilities, trained with CTC loss, for self-training.

Result: Performance improves (e.g., 1.1% CER reduction with PyLaia) and alignment accuracy increases; weaker models yield better alignments.

Conclusion: The iterative method enhances CER and alignment quality, with released code and a corrected dataset for further application.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

*Yongtao Ge,Kangyang Xie,Guangkai Xu,Mingyu Liu,Li Ke,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses video matting limitations by proposing large-scale pre-training with synthetic data and a novel video matting approach leveraging pre-trained video diffusion models for better generalization and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality ground-truth data and poor generalization of existing methods in real-world scenarios motivated the development of a scalable synthetic data pipeline and a new video matting approach.

Method: The method involves large-scale pre-training with diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled datasets, a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline, and a novel video matting architecture leveraging pre-trained video diffusion models for temporal consistency.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets, showing superior performance and strong generalization in real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, ensuring temporal consistency and generalization, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mem4D proposes a dual-memory framework to resolve the Memory Demand Dilemma in dynamic scene reconstruction, balancing long-term stability for static structures and high-fidelity detail retention for dynamic motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between memory representation for static structures and dynamic motion in existing methods leads to compromised reconstructions, either with geometric drift or blurred details.

Method: Mem4D decouples static and dynamic modeling using a dual-memory architecture: Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM) for dynamic motion and Persistent Structure Memory (PSM) for static geometry.

Result: Mem4D achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining global consistency for static elements and high fidelity for dynamic content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the Memory Demand Dilemma, enabling accurate and efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSVLM-QA, a large-scale VQA dataset for remote sensing, addressing limitations in existing datasets through rich annotations and diverse questions. It leverages LLMs and automated processes for annotation and demonstrates its utility by benchmarking VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS VQA datasets lack annotation richness, question diversity, and reasoning capability assessment. RSVLM-QA aims to fill these gaps.

Method: The dataset integrates data from multiple RS datasets and uses a dual-track annotation pipeline: LLMs (GPT-4.1) for detailed annotations and an automated process for object counting QA pairs.

Result: RSVLM-QA includes 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, outperforming existing benchmarks in depth and breadth. Benchmarking shows it effectively evaluates VLMs.

Conclusion: RSVLM-QA is a valuable resource for RS VQA and VLM research, expected to drive advancements in the field.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Method: Development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly detection framework for GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's systems, demonstrated in Pose2Xray and DosimetrEYE applications.

Result: The framework enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality control in synthetic X-ray generation and 3D radiation dose estimation.

Conclusion: This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in preclinical settings by improving robustness, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis

Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays
from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation
dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory

*Jin-Seop Lee,SungJoon Lee,Jaehan Ahn,YunSeok Choi,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAG, a temporal-aware method for zero-shot video temporal grounding, addressing semantic fragmentation and skewed similarity distributions without relying on LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot VTG methods suffer from semantic fragmentation and skewed similarity distributions, and rely on expensive LLMs.

Method: TAG incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and similarity adjustment to capture temporal context and correct similarity distributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets without LLMs.

Conclusion: TAG is a simple yet effective solution for zero-shot VTG, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

TL;DR: VOIDFace introduces a privacy-preserving facial recognition framework using visual secret sharing and patch-based multi-training to eliminate data replication and enhance user control over personal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy and ethical concerns in facial recognition systems due to uncontrolled data replication and lack of user control over personal face data.

Method: Uses visual secret sharing for secure data storage and a patch-based multi-training network to train the system without data replication.

Result: Experimental results on VGGFace2 show VOIDFace ensures Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and privacy while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: VOIDFace successfully enhances privacy, security, and efficiency in facial recognition training while empowering users with data control.

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve patient outcomes by providing intelligent, personalized support to surgical teams through consistent tracking of staff members during long procedures.

Method: TrackOR leverages 3D geometric signatures for online tracking and offline trajectory recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: TrackOR improves association accuracy by 11% over baselines and enables granular, staff-centric analyses.

Conclusion: The framework makes persistent identity tracking feasible, paving the way for personalized intelligent systems and actionable insights like temporal pathway imprints.

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

TL;DR: Omni-Effects is a unified framework for generating prompt-guided and spatially controllable composite visual effects (VFX), addressing limitations of current methods by introducing LoRA-MoE and SAP innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods are limited to single effects due to per-effect LoRA training, hindering applications requiring multiple spatially controllable effects.

Method: Proposes Omni-Effects with LoRA-MoE for diverse effect integration and SAP for spatial control, alongside an IIF module to prevent unwanted blending.

Result: Achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Omni-Effects enables users to specify effect categories and locations, advancing VFX production capabilities.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with perceiving escalator direction due to Implicit Motion Blindness, undermining trust for BVI users. The paper calls for a shift to robust physical perception and human-centered benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the critical failure of MLLMs in perceiving continuous motion, like escalator direction, which affects trustworthiness for the BVI community.

Method: Identifies the Escalator Problem as an example of Implicit Motion Blindness, analyzing its root in frame-sampling paradigms.

Result: Reveals a deeper limitation in MLLMs' ability to perceive low-signal motion, impacting real-world reliability.

Conclusion: Advocates for a paradigm shift toward physical perception and human-centered benchmarks to improve safety and user trust.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD introduces learnable group prompts and a lightweight transformer to enhance Vision Foundation Models for Group Activity Detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-group scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are pretrained on object-centric data and lack group-aware reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in Group Activity Detection (GAD).

Method: ProGraD uses learnable group prompts to guide VFM attention and a two-layer GroupContext Transformer for actor-group associations and behavior inference.

Result: ProGraD achieves gains of 6.5% (Group mAP@1.0) and 8.2% (Group mAP@0.5) in multi-group scenarios with only 10M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: ProGraD bridges the gap in VFMs for GAD, offering interpretable attention maps and superior performance, especially in complex settings.

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: SRA is a search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with ResNet-50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and suboptimal performance of mainstream AutoDA methods.

Method: Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA) uses a heuristic scoring module and asymmetric augmentation strategy to tailor augmentations per sample.

Result: Achieves 78.31% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, enhances downstream tasks, and requires no hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: SRA simplifies AutoDA, offering effective and practical solutions for future tasks.

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tobias Czempiel,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep neural networks in surgical ORs often rely on spurious correlations like footwear or eyewear due to standardized attire, leading to biased models. Using 3D point cloud sequences instead of RGB data helps avoid these biases by focusing on shape and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized attire in ORs obscures identifying features, causing models to exploit incidental cues, which biases tasks like workflow analysis. Addressing this is crucial for accurate intelligent assistance systems.

Method: The study uses gradient-based saliency analysis on OR datasets and proposes encoding personnel as 3D point cloud sequences to separate identity-relevant features from appearance-based confounders.

Result: RGB models drop 12% accuracy in realistic settings due to visual standardization, while geometric methods maintain performance by capturing meaningful biometric features.

Conclusion: Geometric representations (3D point clouds) are more robust for modeling OR personnel, avoiding biases from appearance-based shortcuts.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

*Huawei Sun,Zixu Wang,Hao Feng,Julius Ott,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion algorithm for depth estimation, incorporating text features and weather-aware fusion to improve accuracy, especially under adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods lack weather adaptation and underutilize language descriptions, despite radar's robustness in adverse conditions.

Method: Introduces text-generation and feature fusion techniques, then proposes TRIDE with weather-aware fusion to adapt radar weighting based on weather.

Result: Achieves 12.87% MAE and 9.08% RMSE improvements on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: TRIDE enhances depth estimation by integrating text, radar, and weather-aware fusion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to convert monocular videos into 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos without additional training, using depth estimation and a novel inpainting framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating immersive 3D videos from monocular video models, which is underexplored.

Method: Leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video model, warps videos into pre-defined viewpoints using depth, and applies a frame matrix inpainting framework for consistency. A dual-update scheme improves inpainting quality.

Result: Produces high-quality 3D videos, outperforming previous methods, as validated on videos from models like Sora and Lumiere.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates immersive 3D videos without additional training, offering significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrIINeR integrates prior knowledge from deep learning into Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for improved MRI reconstruction at high acceleration factors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated MRI often degrades image quality, and existing INR-based methods struggle with structural loss and aliasing at high acceleration factors.

Method: PrIINeR combines population-level knowledge from pre-trained models with instance-based optimization and dual data consistency in the INR framework.

Result: PrIINeR outperforms state-of-the-art INR and learning-based methods on the NYU fastMRI dataset, improving structural preservation and reducing aliasing.

Conclusion: PrIINeR bridges deep learning and INR techniques, offering a reliable solution for high-quality accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

### [193] [Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention for Multi-label Medical Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08069)
*Xiaoxiao Cui,Yiran Li,Kai He,Shanzhi Jiang,Mengli Xue,Wentao Li,Junhong Leng,Zhi Liu,Lizhen Cui,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) method for multi-label classification of medical images, addressing the challenge of interpreting true causes by filtering irrelevant features and enhancing causal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-label classification in medical images struggle with interpreting true causes due to attention to irrelevant features, limiting accurate diagnosis and interpretability.

Method: The authors introduce a structural causal model (SCM) and IBCA, which uses Gaussian mixture multi-label spatial attention to filter irrelevant information and contrastive enhancement to mitigate spurious attention.

Result: IBCA outperforms other methods on Endo and MuReD datasets, with significant improvements in metrics like CR, OR, mAP, and CF1.

Conclusion: The proposed IBCA method effectively improves multi-label classification by learning discriminative class-specific attention, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in
mAP for Endo.

### [194] [ME-TST+: Micro-expression Analysis via Temporal State Transition with ROI Relationship Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08082)
*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Junbao Zhuo,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ME-TST and ME-TST+, two state space model-based architectures for micro-expression analysis, improving temporal dynamics modeling and integrating spotting and recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for micro-expression analysis use fixed window lengths and treat spotting and recognition separately, limiting performance.

Method: ME-TST and ME-TST+ replace window-level classification with video-level regression, using temporal state transition mechanisms. ME-TST+ adds multi-granularity ROI modeling and slowfast Mamba to reduce information loss.

Result: The methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in micro-expression analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures effectively address limitations of prior methods, enhancing micro-expression analysis through integrated spotting and recognition.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

TL;DR: Matrix-3D is a framework for generating explorable 3D worlds from single images or text prompts using panoramic representations, combining video generation and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D world generation have limited scope in generated scenes. Matrix-3D aims to address this by leveraging panoramic representations for wider coverage.

Method: The framework uses a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model and two reconstruction methods: a feed-forward model for speed and an optimization-based pipeline for accuracy.

Result: Matrix-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video and 3D world generation, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances 3D world generation by improving scope and quality, supported by the new Matrix-Pano dataset.

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

TL;DR: A Multimodal Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net) using acoustic and visual data from social media outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 17.37% in F1-Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression severely impacts mental health, and social media data offers a simple yet rich source for detection research.

Method: MDD-Net uses mutual transformers to extract and fuse acoustic and visual features, with four modules: feature extraction, mutual transformer, and detection.

Result: Experiments on the D-Vlog dataset show MDD-Net outperforms existing methods by up to 17.37% in F1-Score.

Conclusion: MDD-Net is highly effective for depression detection, leveraging multimodal social media data.

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Ge Jin,Wenzhan Song,Tianming Liu,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for extracting 3D root skeletons from images is introduced, addressing challenges in capturing complex root architectures and enabling automated breeding applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant roots' complex 3D architecture and lack of texture/color make traditional 2D studies insufficient. 3D phenotypic data is vital for genetic and developmental research.

Method: The method involves detecting/matching lateral roots, triangulating their skeletal structure, and integrating them with primary roots. Tested on a complex root dataset.

Result: Extracted 3D skeletons closely matched ground truth, proving the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach enhances automated breeding robots by improving root trait analysis, boosting efficiency and reducing manual work in modern agriculture.

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

TL;DR: TBAC-UniImage integrates a pre-trained Diffusion Model with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for deeper multimodal understanding and generation, avoiding shallow connections and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of previous diffusion-based unified models, which either have shallow connections or require expensive pretraining.

Method: Uses representations from multiple MLLM layers as generative conditions for the diffusion model, treating it as a 'ladder' for deeper unification.

Result: Achieves deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.

Conclusion: TBAC-UniImage presents a novel, efficient paradigm for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision
agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and
security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual
features for advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making. Persistent
challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the
complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,
and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing,
reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support
transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward
scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor
miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

TL;DR: GRASPTrack integrates depth estimation and instance segmentation into tracking-by-detection for 3D geometric reasoning, improving MOT robustness in occluded and complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT methods lack geometric awareness, struggling with occlusions and depth ambiguity.

Method: Combines monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation to generate 3D point clouds, uses voxel-based 3D IoU for association, and introduces depth-aware noise compensation and motion cues.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks, especially in occluded and complex scenarios.

Conclusion: GRASPTrack enhances MOT robustness by leveraging 3D geometric reasoning and adaptive depth-aware techniques.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Shape is a training-free, mask-free framework for precise object shape editing, preserving non-target content via Trajectory Divergence Maps and Scheduled KV Injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based image editing models struggle with large-scale shape transformations, often degrading background quality or altering non-target regions.

Method: Uses Trajectory Divergence Maps (TDM) to localize editable regions and Scheduled KV Injection for stable editing. Introduces ReShapeBench for evaluation.

Result: Superior editability and visual fidelity, especially in large-scale shape replacement tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses challenges in shape-aware editing, offering precise control and high-quality results.

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

TL;DR: FantasyStyle is a 3DGS-based style transfer framework using diffusion model distillation to address multi-view inconsistency and VGG feature reliance, achieving superior stylization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based style transfer methods suffer from multi-view inconsistency and VGG feature limitations, causing style conflicts and content leakage.

Method: FantasyStyle introduces Multi-View Frequency Consistency and Controllable Stylized Distillation, leveraging diffusion model distillation and negative guidance.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, delivering higher stylization quality and visual realism.

Conclusion: FantasyStyle effectively resolves key challenges in 3D style transfer, offering improved consistency and control.

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

*Yan Wang,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TUNA, a method integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) to improve performance by leveraging both specialized and shared knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods using pre-trained models often freeze the network and use lightweight modules, leading to incorrect module selection and overlooking shared knowledge, causing errors in distinguishing similar classes across tasks.

Method: TUNA trains task-specific adapters for crucial task features and uses an entropy-based selection mechanism. It also employs adapter fusion to create a universal adapter for shared discriminative features, combining both for inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show TUNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TUNA effectively addresses CIL challenges by balancing task-specific and shared knowledge, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

### [205] [ReconDreamer-RL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08170)
*Chaojun Ni,Guosheng Zhao,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Wenkang Qin,Xinze Chen,Guanghong Jia,Guan Huang,Wenjun Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconDreamer-RL integrates video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to enhance autonomous driving training, reducing the sim2real gap and improving performance over imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the sim2real gap in autonomous driving simulations, which often fail to render high-quality sensor data for novel or corner-case scenarios.

Method: Proposes ReconDreamer-RL with ReconSimulator (combining video diffusion priors and kinematic models), Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA) for corner-case generation, and Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) to diversify training data.

Result: Achieves a 5x reduction in Collision Ratio compared to imitation learning methods.

Conclusion: ReconDreamer-RL effectively bridges the sim2real gap and enhances training for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

### [206] [CD-TVD: Contrastive Diffusion for 3D Super-Resolution with Scarce High-Resolution Time-Varying Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08173)
*Chongke Bi,Xin Gao,Jiangkang Deng,Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CD-TVD is a novel framework combining contrastive learning and diffusion-based super-resolution for accurate 3D super-resolution with limited high-resolution data, reducing reliance on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale simulations require costly high-resolution data; existing super-resolution methods need extensive HR training data, limiting their applicability.

Method: CD-TVD uses contrastive learning and an improved diffusion model with local attention, pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned with minimal new HR data.

Result: CD-TVD achieves accurate and efficient 3D super-resolution on fluid and atmospheric datasets, reducing dependency on large HR datasets.

Conclusion: CD-TVD advances data augmentation for scientific simulations by enabling high-quality super-resolution with limited HR data.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

*Zhonghao Yan,Muxi Diao,Yuxuan Yang,Jiayuan Xu,Kaizhou Zhang,Ruoyan Jing,Lele Yang,Yanxi Liu,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a new vision-language task, and MedReasoner, a modular framework for clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. It also releases U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples, and shows state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical-grounding pipelines rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, which fail to handle implicit queries common in clinical practice.

Method: The paper proposes MedReasoner, a modular framework separating reasoning (optimized with reinforcement learning) from segmentation (using a frozen expert). Alignment is achieved through format and accuracy rewards.

Result: MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and generalizes well to unseen clinical queries.

Conclusion: The work highlights the promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding, offering a robust solution for clinical reasoning and segmentation.

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

### [208] [3D Human Mesh Estimation from Single View RGBD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08178)
*Ozhan Suat,Bedirhan Uguz,Batuhan Karagoz,Muhammed Can Keles,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method named M³ (Masked Mesh Modeling) is introduced for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from single RGBD views, leveraging MoCap datasets to overcome data scarcity. It outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGBD cameras are underutilized despite their affordability and depth data potential. Existing datasets for 3D human mesh estimation are limited in size and diversity.

Method: Uses MoCap datasets to simulate partial, single-view meshes, trains a masked autoencoder to complete them, and matches sensor depth to a template mesh during inference.

Result: Achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm PVE on SURREAL and CAPE datasets, outperforming methods using full-body point clouds. Also outperforms an RGB-based method by 18.4 mm on BEHAVE.

Conclusion: M³ effectively recovers full-body meshes from partial views, demonstrating the value of depth data and outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

### [209] [PP-Motion: Physical-Perceptual Fidelity Evaluation for Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08179)
*Sihan Zhao,Zixuan Wang,Tianyu Luan,Jia Jia,Wentao Zhu,Jiebo Luo,Junsong Yuan,Nan Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PP-Motion, a data-driven metric for evaluating human motion fidelity by combining physical alignment and human perception, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion fidelity evaluation methods rely on subjective human perception or physical constraints, lacking a robust, objective metric.

Method: A physical labeling method calculates minimal modifications for physical alignment, producing fine-grained annotations. PP-Motion uses Pearson's correlation loss for physical priors and a perceptual fidelity loss for human alignment.

Result: PP-Motion aligns better with physical laws and human perception than prior work.

Conclusion: PP-Motion provides a more comprehensive and objective evaluation of motion fidelity, bridging the gap between physical feasibility and human perception.

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

### [210] [THAT: Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer for Hyperspectral Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08183)
*Hongkun Jin,Hongcheng Jiang,Zejun Zhang,Yuan Zhang,Jia Fu,Tingfeng Li,Kai Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes THAT, a Transformer-based framework for hyperspectral pansharpening, addressing redundancy and multi-scale feature limitations with PTSA and MVFN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer methods for hyperspectral pansharpening suffer from redundant tokens and poor high-frequency feature preservation.

Method: THAT introduces Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) for token prioritization and Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) for high-frequency detail learning.

Result: THAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with improved reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: THAT effectively addresses the limitations of Vision Transformers in hyperspectral pansharpening, enhancing high-frequency feature representation and token selection.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

TL;DR: KARMA is a lightweight semantic segmentation framework for structural defects, using efficient feature transformations and multi-scale analysis to achieve high performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in semantic segmentation of structural defects, such as variable appearances, harsh conditions, and class imbalance, while reducing computational overhead for real-time inspection.

Method: Introduces KARMA with three innovations: TiKAN module for efficient feature transformation, optimized feature pyramid for multi-scale analysis, and a static-dynamic prototype mechanism for imbalanced classes.

Result: Achieves competitive mean IoU with 97% fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M) and operates at 0.264 GFLOPS, enabling real-time deployment.

Conclusion: KARMA provides an efficient, accurate solution for automated infrastructure inspection, balancing performance and practicality.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Motivation: To provide a coherent and up-to-date synthesis of the rapidly evolving field of visual RL, aiding researchers and practitioners in understanding its landscape and future directions.

Method: Organizes over 200 works into four thematic pillars (multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, vision-language-action models), examining algorithmic design, reward engineering, and benchmark progress.

Result: Identifies trends like curriculum-driven training and unified reward modeling, and reviews evaluation protocols for fidelity, preference, and stability.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges such as sample efficiency and safe deployment, offering a resource for future research in visual RL.

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial-ORMLLM is a new vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for spatial modeling in ORs rely on multimodal datasets, which are hard to obtain, and 2D data, which lacks fine-grained details.

Method: Spatial-ORMLLM uses RGB data and a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block to integrate 2D inputs with 3D knowledge, enabling robust 3D reasoning without extra sensors or annotations.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on clinical datasets and generalizes well to new surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM provides a practical and effective solution for 3D spatial reasoning in ORs using minimal data.

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: SAGOnline is a lightweight, zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, addressing computational inefficiency and multi-object tracking challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods face high computational costs, limited spatial reasoning, and inability to track multiple objects simultaneously.

Method: SAGOnline integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for 2D mask propagation and uses a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation algorithm for Gaussian-level instance labeling.

Result: Achieves 92.7% mIoU on NVOS and 95.2% mIoU on Spin-NeRF, with 15--1500x faster inference speed (27 ms/frame).

Conclusion: SAGOnline enables real-time 3D segmentation and tracking, advancing AR/VR and robotic applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

*Wenyi Mo,Ying Ba,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Biye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Large Language Model-based approach with contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to predict personalized user preferences, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for user preference prediction often overlook individual variability and dynamic tastes, relying on general preferences or static profiles.

Method: Uses Multimodal Large Language Models with contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn personalized preferences from historical interactions.

Result: The model achieves higher accuracy in preference prediction, identifies users with similar tastes, and improves image generation alignment with individual preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches, offering a more dynamic and personalized solution for user preference prediction.

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMGSR is a framework for one-step Real-ISR using DDPM/FM models, injecting LQ image latents at mid-timesteps to align distributions and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between LQ image latent distribution and Gaussian noisy latent distribution limits generative priors' effectiveness in Real-ISR.

Method: OMGSR injects LQ latents at mid-timesteps, uses Latent Distribution Refinement loss, and Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to reduce artifacts.

Result: OMGSR variants (OMGSR-S/F) achieve balanced/excellent performance at 512-resolution, with OMGSR-F dominating all metrics. 1k/2k-resolution results are also strong.

Conclusion: OMGSR effectively bridges the latent distribution gap and enhances Real-ISR performance across resolutions.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

*Jingwen He,Hongbo Liu,Jiajun Li,Ziqi Huang,Yu Qiao,Wanli Ouyang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cut2Next introduces a Diffusion Transformer framework for generating cinematically coherent next shots, outperforming current methods in visual consistency and narrative flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-shot generation methods lack narrative sophistication and cinematic integrity, focusing only on basic visual consistency.

Method: Cut2Next uses a Diffusion Transformer with Hierarchical Multi-Prompting, Context-Aware Condition Injection, and Hierarchical Attention Mask to generate shots adhering to professional editing patterns.

Result: Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity, with user studies showing strong preference for its adherence to editing patterns and cinematic continuity.

Conclusion: Cut2Next successfully bridges the gap in multi-shot generation, producing high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically coherent shots.

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableAvatar is an end-to-end video diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length, high-quality videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency, addressing limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with long video synthesis, audio synchronization, and identity consistency due to reliance on third-party audio embeddings and lack of audio priors.

Method: StableAvatar introduces a Time-step-aware Audio Adapter to prevent error accumulation, an Audio Native Guidance Mechanism for better synchronization, and a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy for smoothness.

Result: Experiments show StableAvatar outperforms benchmarks in generating high-quality, infinite-length videos with improved audio synchronization and consistency.

Conclusion: StableAvatar successfully addresses the challenges of long video generation and audio synchronization, offering a robust solution for avatar video synthesis.

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: R3DGS introduces a task for segmenting 3D objects using natural language descriptions, addressing challenges like occlusion and spatial relationships. The paper proposes ReferSplat, a framework achieving top performance, and releases the Ref-LERF dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing embodied AI by enabling 3D multi-modal understanding and segmentation of objects based on natural language descriptions, including spatial relationships and attributes.

Method: Proposes ReferSplat, a framework that models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm.

Result: ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on R3DGS and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of 3D multi-modal understanding and introduces a novel task, dataset, and framework to advance research in this area.

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

*Emily Yue-Ting Jia,Jiageng Mao,Zhiyuan Gao,Yajie Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating 4D scenes (motion + 3D geometry) from a single image using physics-informed neural networks, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can imagine 4D scenes from still images, but current neural methods produce unrealistic animations. The goal is to replicate human-like physics-consistent animation.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network to predict motion guided by physical principles (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations). Predicts 3D Gaussians for appearance and animates them.

Result: Produces physically plausible animations, significantly improving over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between human intuition and neural networks for 4D scene generation.

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

### [221] [Solving Pasur Using GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06559)
*Sina Baghal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A CUDA-accelerated framework for simulating Pasur, a fishing card game, using CFR to compute near-Nash equilibria, with efficient memory management and GPU-accelerated self-play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pasur's complex rules and large game tree pose unique computational challenges, requiring efficient memory and computational solutions.

Method: Decompose the game tree into states and inherited scores, use PyTorch CUDA tensors, and apply round-by-round backward training.

Result: Constructs a game tree with over 10^9 nodes, computes near-Nash equilibria, and trains a tree-based model for strategy prediction.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and applicable to other multi-round games or sequential decision problems.

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciLink is an AI framework designed to foster serendipitous discoveries in materials research by linking experimental data, novelty assessment, and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern labs focus on efficiency, often missing unplanned discoveries. SciLink aims to bridge this gap by integrating AI to operationalize serendipity.

Method: Uses hybrid AI: ML models for data analysis and LLMs for reasoning. Converts raw data into scientific claims, scores novelty, and proposes follow-ups.

Result: Demonstrated versatility in diverse scenarios, integrating human guidance and closing research loops with targeted experiments.

Conclusion: SciLink enhances efficiency while fostering serendipity, bridging automated experimentation and open-ended exploration.

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IRL-VLA, a three-stage framework combining Vision-Language-Action models with inverse reinforcement learning for autonomous driving, achieving top performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models in autonomous driving face challenges like suboptimal open-loop imitation learning and inefficiencies in close-loop training due to simulation gaps.

Method: The framework involves: (1) pretraining VLA via imitation learning, (2) building a lightweight reward world model via inverse RL, and (3) refining planning with PPO-based reinforcement learning.

Result: IRL-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 and ranks 1st runner-up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances close-loop autonomous driving by addressing key challenges and improving performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous
driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1)
Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in
open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset,
leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

### [224] [CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585)
*Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover,Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CountQA is a new benchmark to evaluate object counting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing their poor performance (42.9% accuracy) in complex, cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack fundamental object counting skills, limiting real-world reliability. Existing benchmarks are inadequate for testing this in realistic conditions.

Method: Introduces CountQA, a benchmark with 1,500 question-answer pairs featuring high-density, cluttered, and occluded real-world images. Evaluates 15 MLLMs.

Result: Top model achieves only 42.9% accuracy, with performance worsening as object counts increase.

Conclusion: CountQA addresses a critical gap, enabling future MLLMs to improve numerical and spatial awareness. Dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

### [225] [Formal Concept Analysis: a Structural Framework for Variability Extraction and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06668)
*Jessie Galasso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) for variability analysis, identifying key properties and their applications in interpreting variability within conceptual structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in leveraging FCA's mathematical properties for variability-related tasks, given its potential but unclear applicability.

Method: Gathers essential properties of FCA and demonstrates their use in interpreting variability information within conceptual structures.

Result: Identifies key FCA properties useful for variability analysis and provides insights into their application.

Conclusion: FCA's properties can effectively support variability analysis, offering a structured approach to interpreting variability in conceptual hierarchies.

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

*Weijie Shi,Yue Cui,Hao Chen,Jiaming Li,Mengze Li,Jia Zhu,Jiajie Xu,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, leveraging transferable geospatial knowledge and sequential features to improve accuracy without region-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CTMM methods rely on region-specific data, limiting adaptability to unexplored areas. Zero-shot CTMM aims to overcome this by extracting region-adaptive features and addressing positioning errors.

Method: Uses a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant with a Gaussian mixture model in VAE for scenario-adaptive experts and a spatial-temporal awareness module for sequential features. A constrained path-finding algorithm ensures topological validity.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot CTMM methods by 16.8%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of current CTMM approaches, achieving higher accuracy in unexplored regions without additional training.

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

*Jaikrishna Manojkumar Patil,Nathaniel Lee,Al Mehdi Saadat Chowdhury,YooJung Choi,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reduce the number of rules in rule-based knowledge graph completion by discovering rule contexts and using probabilistic circuits, achieving competitive performance with fewer rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion are explainable but require many rules, which can hinder explainability. The goal is to reduce the rule count while maintaining performance.

Method: The approach discovers rule contexts (meaningful rule subsets) and uses probabilistic circuits to model their distribution, enabling efficient inference with fewer rules.

Result: The method reduces rules by 70-96%, outperforms baselines by up to 31x with minimal rules, and preserves 91% of peak baseline performance. It also provides tractable inference with exact and approximate probabilities.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, grounded in probabilistic logic, and validated on benchmarks, showing competitive performance with fewer rules than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

TL;DR: GLIDR introduces a differentiable rule learning method for knowledge graphs, outperforming existing techniques by allowing more expressive rule structures like branches and cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ILP techniques are limited by chain-like rule structures, reducing performance and interpretability.

Method: GLIDR uses a differentiable message passing algorithm to learn expressive rules, parameterized by free variables, and can extract symbolic rules for solvers.

Result: GLIDR outperforms existing rule learning methods, competes with embedding methods, and is robust to noise. Rules retain predictive power.

Conclusion: GLIDR advances rule learning by enabling expressive syntax, integrates with neural networks, and performs well on knowledge graph tasks.

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallelization is key for solving complex MIP problems efficiently, but Balans's parallel potential is unexplored.

Method: Introduces ParBalans, combining solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism.

Result: ParBalans performs competitively against Gurobi, especially on hard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Parallelization in Balans (via ParBalans) effectively enhances MIP solving performance.

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial
computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has
emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance
scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the
parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed
bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's
modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse
parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To
address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both
solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on
challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans
exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial
solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of reliable connectivity and covert communication in UAV networks for sensitive applications like urban monitoring and emergency response.

Method: Combines Graph Diffusion-based Policy Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism to dynamically generate topologies and guide UAV behaviors.

Result: Validated effectiveness in model convergence, topology generation quality, and covert communication enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully tackles mobility and exposure risks in UAV networks, ensuring robust and covert operations.

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit) that match full-precision models in performance. It optimizes microkernels for CPUs and integrates them into PyTorch-TPP, achieving up to 2.2x speedup over SOTA runtimes and 7x over 16-bit models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored computational efficiency of SOTA inference runtimes for ultra-low-bit LLM models, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices like edge and AI PCs.

Method: Design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, integrate them into PyTorch-TPP, and evaluate end-to-end inference performance.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2x speedup over bitnet.cpp and 7x over 16-bit models, demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The optimized runtime advances LLM inference efficiency, enabling practical deployment of ultra-low-bit models on edge devices and AI PCs.

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular prompting framework for safer, adaptive LLM use, grounded in human learning theory, improves scaffolding and adaptivity in tasks like tutoring and gaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic, user-centered tasks by leveraging human learning theory (ZPD).

Method: Combines natural language boundary prompts with a control schema using fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules, enabling behavior modulation without fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms standard prompting baselines in scaffolding quality, adaptivity, and instructional alignment in simulated tutoring and other domains.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reusable, interpretable methodology for goal-aligned LLM behavior in uncertain or evolving contexts, with broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content

*Xuan Zhao,Jun Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using natural language and reinforcement learning to automate optimal viewpoint selection for volumetric data exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplifying volumetric data navigation for users lacking domain expertise or 3D navigation skills.

Method: Encodes volumetric blocks, uses CLIP Score for semantic guidance, and employs reinforcement learning for viewpoint selection.

Result: Improves efficiency and interpretability of volumetric data exploration.

Conclusion: Automated viewpoint selection enhances user experience and scientific data interpretation.

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user
queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency
of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex
scientific phenomena.

*Haifeng Li,Wang Guo,Haiyang Wu,Mengwei Wu,Jipeng Zhang,Qing Zhu,Yu Liu,Xin Huang,Chao Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from vision-centered to language-centered remote sensing interpretation, using LLMs as a cognitive hub inspired by Global Workspace Theory, addressing challenges like multimodal representation and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-centered models lack multi-modal reasoning and semantic abstraction. The paper advocates for a language-centered approach to unify understanding and decision-making.

Method: Proposes a language-centered framework using LLMs as a cognitive hub, integrating perceptual, task, knowledge, and action spaces, and reviews technical challenges and solutions.

Result: Outlines a global workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and reviews how language-centered solutions address challenges like knowledge association and reasoning.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for next-gen remote sensing systems, suggesting future research in adaptive alignment, task understanding, trustworthy reasoning, and autonomous interaction.

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACA, a method for multi-level credit assignment in cooperative MARL, using counterfactual reasoning and attention to improve performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of credit assignment in MARL, where diverse agent contributions and overlapping subsets complicate reward attribution.

Method: Proposes Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), integrating advantage functions for individual, joint, and correlated actions, using an attention-based framework.

Result: MACA outperforms baselines in Starcraft tasks, demonstrating effective credit assignment across multiple levels.

Conclusion: MACA provides a robust solution for complex credit assignment in MARL, validated by superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MDK12-Bench is introduced as a large-scale, multidisciplinary benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using real-world K-12 exams, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for MLLMs lack scale, coverage, and structured knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model intelligence comprehensively.

Method: MDK12-Bench includes 141K instances across six disciplines, organized by knowledge points and question formats. A dynamic evaluation framework tests model generalization across difficulty, temporal shifts, contextual shifts, and knowledge-driven reasoning. KP-RAG is used to assess knowledge's role in problem-solving.

Result: Current MLLMs show limitations in robustness and interpretability, particularly in handling unfamiliar shifts and knowledge-driven tasks.

Conclusion: MDK12-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation tool for MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement in model robustness, interpretability, and AI-assisted education.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MP-Bench, a large-scale dataset for severe weather prediction, and MMLM, a multimodal model addressing challenges in AI-driven weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather forecasting relies on manual interpretation, which is subjective and burdensome. AI offers potential for automation but faces challenges like data scarcity and alignment issues.

Method: Developed MP-Bench dataset and MMLM model with adaptive fusion modules for 4D meteorological data.

Result: MMLM performs exceptionally on MP-Bench, demonstrating effectiveness in severe weather prediction.

Conclusion: The work advances AI-driven weather forecasting, with plans to release the dataset and code publicly.

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

### [238] [Pushdown Reward Machines for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06894)
*Giovanni Varricchione,Toryn Q. Klassen,Natasha Alechina,Mehdi Dastani,Brian Logan,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines, to handle more complex behaviors in reinforcement learning by recognizing deterministic context-free languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the expressiveness of reward machines (RMs) in reinforcement learning by enabling them to recognize and reward temporally extended behaviors representable in deterministic context-free languages.

Method: Proposes pdRMs based on deterministic pushdown automata, introduces two policy variants (full-stack and top-k stack access), and provides theoretical and experimental validation.

Result: Theoretical results confirm pdRMs' expressive power, and experiments demonstrate successful training of agents for tasks requiring deterministic context-free languages.

Conclusion: pdRMs extend the capabilities of RMs, offering a more expressive framework for reinforcement learning tasks involving complex behaviors.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

*Yanchen Deng,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DGLS improves local search in DCOPs by addressing GDBA's issues with adaptive constraints, penalty control, and synchronization, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local search in DCOPs often converges to poor optima; GDBA's marginal benefits prompt a need for better solutions.

Method: Proposes DGLS with adaptive violation conditions, penalty evaporation, and synchronized updates.

Result: DGLS outperforms baselines, especially on structured problems (3.77%--66.3% better).

Conclusion: DGLS is a superior framework for DCOPs, combining theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CRAMF is a framework for automated mathematical formalization using retrieval-augmented generation to address challenges like model hallucination and semantic gaps. It improves LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions from Mathlib4, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual formalization in ITPs is labor-intensive and requires expertise. Automated formalization faces issues like model hallucination and semantic gaps, motivating the need for a solution like CRAMF.

Method: CRAMF retrieves formal definitions from Mathlib4, using contextual query augmentation and a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy for accuracy.

Result: CRAMF improves translation accuracy by up to 62.1% (average 29.9%) on benchmarks like miniF2F, ProofNet, and AdvancedMath.

Conclusion: CRAMF effectively enhances autoformalization by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, addressing key challenges in automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding
consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an
average of 29.9% relative improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Transformer-based models for multimodal learning in crop yield prediction, emphasizing interpretability through attention mechanisms and comparing methods like AR, GA, and SVS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability in multimodal learning for agriculture, leveraging diverse data sources like satellite imagery, weather, terrain, and soil properties.

Method: Uses Transformer-based models with self-attention for feature attribution (AR, GA) and introduces WMA for modality attribution, comparing against SVS.

Result: Transformer models outperform convolutional and recurrent networks, with AR providing more reliable temporal attributions. Modality attributions vary across methods.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models enhance interpretability and performance in crop yield prediction, with AR being a robust method for temporal feature attribution.

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT are not reliable substitutes for human participants in psychological studies due to conceptual and empirical discrepancies in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To caution against using LLMs as replacements for human participants in psychology research, highlighting their unreliability.

Method: Conceptual arguments and empirical evidence showing discrepancies between LLM and human responses, even with fine-tuned models like CENTAUR.

Result: LLMs exhibit notable inconsistencies in responses compared to humans, especially with slight wording changes, and lack reliability across different models.

Conclusion: LLMs do not simulate human psychology and should be validated against human responses for each new application in psychological research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Conclusion: The benchmark sets a baseline for future AI systems to achieve perfect dataset discovery, with findings publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the

countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis

Motivation: Addressing costly, slow, and inflexible existing repair methods (SFT, RLHF, prompt engineering) for LLM trustworthiness issues.

Method: Proposes MASteer with AutoTester (multi-agent sample generation) and AutoRepairer (adaptive steering strategies).

Result: Improves metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: MASteer offers scalable, efficient, and robust trustworthiness repair for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Motivation: To minimize trust and costs in distributed ML inference by avoiding full-model circuitization and enabling flexible verification.

Method: Uses strategically chosen verifiable subcomputations ("slices") with global consistency enforced via audit, replication, or incentives.

Result: Evaluated with multiple proving systems, showing empirical data on memory, runtime, and circuit behavior.

Conclusion: DSperse offers scalable, targeted verification adaptable to diverse needs by aligning proof boundaries with model structure.

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging
paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the
high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop safe, efficient, and explainable AI by understanding purposeful behavior in autonomous agents using biologically plausible models.

Result: Demonstrates learning in agents, highlighting memory-based learning and predictive planning in decision-making.

Conclusion: Contributes to explainable AI with a scalable, biologically grounded approach to understanding agent behavior.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in
a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use
biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing
insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in
intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of
explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores alternative methods for hitting set optimization in the implicit hitting set (IHS) framework, comparing pseudo-Boolean reasoning and stochastic local search to traditional integer programming. It highlights trade-offs between efficiency and reliability, with exact PB reasoning proving competitive and offering correctness certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional integer programming in IHS, such as numerical instability, and to explore more reliable and efficient alternatives like pseudo-Boolean reasoning and stochastic local search.

Method: The study evaluates alternative techniques for hitting set optimization, including pseudo-Boolean reasoning and stochastic local search, comparing them to integer programming in the context of IHS.

Result: Results show that while commercial IP solvers are efficient, they can suffer from numerical instability. Exact PB reasoning is competitive and provides correctness certificates, enhancing reliability.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the trade-off between efficiency and reliability in IHS, advocating for PB reasoning as a viable alternative to IP solvers due to its correctness guarantees and competitive performance.

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

### [248] [MultiMedEdit: A Scenario-Aware Benchmark for Evaluating Knowledge Editing in Medical VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07022)
*Shengtao Wen,Haodong Chen,Yadong Wang,Zhongying Pan,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Bo Qian,Dong Liang,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiMedEdit is the first benchmark for evaluating knowledge editing (KE) in multimodal medical tasks, addressing gaps in current methods for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KE methods lack focus on multimodal medical scenarios, which require integrating updated knowledge with visual reasoning for safe clinical decisions.

Method: Proposes MultiMedEdit, a framework with tasks, metrics (reliability, generality, locality), and cross-paradigm comparisons, tested under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings.

Result: Current KE methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning in clinical workflows, with trade-offs in efficiency (edit latency, memory).

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit highlights limitations of current KE approaches and lays groundwork for future clinically robust techniques.

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

*Orion Li,Vinayak Agarwal,Summer Zhou,Ashwin Gopinath,Timothy Kassis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system, outperforms top LLMs in bioinformatics by 6.3% on BixBench, using a dual-loop architecture for autonomous analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between data generation and scientific insights in bioinformatics, where LLMs fall short in iterative workflows and tool integration.

Method: Introduces K-Dense Analyst, a multi-agent system with a dual-loop architecture for planning and validated execution in secure environments.

Result: Achieves 29.2% accuracy on BixBench, surpassing GPT-5 by 6.3%, using Gemini 2.5 Pro (18.3% baseline).

Conclusion: Autonomous scientific reasoning requires purpose-built systems, not just enhanced LLMs, to bridge high-level objectives and computational execution.

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

*Naseem Machlovi,Maryam Saleki,Innocent Ababio,Ruhul Amin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' limitations in nuanced moderation tasks like detecting hate, bias, and offensive language, proposing SafePhi, a fine-tuned model outperforming benchmarks, while emphasizing the need for better data and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing integration of AI in daily life demands safer, more reliable moderation, but LLMs struggle with nuanced moral reasoning and societal biases.

Method: Developed an experimental framework using SOTA models to evaluate LLMs on a diverse benchmark dataset, and introduced SafePhi, a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4.

Result: SafePhi achieved a Macro F1 score of 0.89, outperforming OpenAI Moderator (0.77) and Llama Guard (0.74), but identified critical underperformance areas in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs need more heterogeneous data and human-in-the-loop approaches for robustness and explainability in moderation tasks.

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static machine learning models in education lack adaptability to new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, limiting their effectiveness for timely academic intervention.

Method: The system combines a LightGBM-based regressor with incremental retraining, a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction, and SHAP for explainability.

Result: Experimental results show a 10.7% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with improved prediction accuracy for intervened students.

Conclusion: The framework advances educational analytics by enabling self-improving, human-centered, and responsive AI, designed for integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional table-to-text models struggle with hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas in business reporting.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.

Result: Achieves 83% faithfulness, superior coverage of changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for critical insights.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves summarization quality, especially for subtle trade-offs, outperforming baseline approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data
across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

TL;DR: EndoAgent is a memory-guided AI agent for endoscopic image diagnosis, integrating iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods lack unified coordination for multi-step clinical workflows in endoscopy, and AI agents' potential in this domain is underexplored.

Method: EndoAgent uses a dual-memory design for short-term action tracking and long-term experiential learning, integrating expert-designed tools in a unified reasoning loop.

Result: EndoAgent outperforms general and medical multimodal models, demonstrating strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: EndoAgent advances endoscopic AI by combining memory-guided reasoning with adaptive tool use, validated by a new benchmark.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the core obstacle of illusions in LLMs, hindering reliable deployment.

Method: Formalizes LLMs as probabilistic Turing machines, uses computational necessity hierarchy, and introduces the learner pump lemma. Proposes RAGs as oracle machines and continuous learning via neural game theory.

Result: Proves illusions are inevitable but provides two escape routes: RAGs and continuous learning.

Conclusion: The paper offers theoretical foundations for mitigating LLM illusions through RAGs and continuous learning.

Abstract: The illusion phenomenon of large language models (LLMs) is the core obstacle
to their reliable deployment. This article formalizes the large language model
as a probabilistic Turing machine by constructing a "computational necessity
hierarchy", and for the first time proves the illusions are inevitable on
diagonalization, incomputability, and information theory boundaries supported
by the new "learner pump lemma". However, we propose two "escape routes": one
is to model Retrieval Enhanced Generations (RAGs) as oracle machines, proving
their absolute escape through "computational jumps", providing the first formal
theory for the effectiveness of RAGs; The second is to formalize continuous
learning as an "internalized oracle" mechanism and implement this path through

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework for domain-specific LLMs, emphasizing comprehensiveness and compactness over scaling laws, validated by creating XUBench in the academic domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs rely on scaling laws, but the impact of corpus and QA set design on precision and recall is unexplored.

Method: Proposes Comp-Comp, a framework balancing comprehensiveness (semantic recall) and compactness (precision) for corpus and QA set construction.

Result: Validated with XUBench, a large-scale closed-domain benchmark in academia, showing the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Comp-Comp is extensible beyond academia, offering insights for domain-specific benchmark construction.

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pentest-R1 is a framework using two-stage reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs for penetration testing, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with error handling, reasoning, and autonomous task execution in penetration testing, necessitating improved solutions.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline: offline RL on real-world walkthroughs and online RL in a CTF environment for fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 24.2% success on AutoPenBench and 15.0% on Cybench, outperforming most models and matching proprietary ones.

Conclusion: The combined offline and online RL stages are crucial for Pentest-R1's success in automating penetration testing.

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Invert4TVG improves Temporal Video Grounding by integrating inversion tasks (Verb Completion, Action Recognition, Video Description) to enhance both localization accuracy and semantic action understanding, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TVG methods overfit to temporal IoU, compromising semantic action understanding, which is crucial for robust localization.

Method: Introduces Invert4TVG with three inversion tasks (Verb Completion, Action Recognition, Video Description) integrated via reinforcement learning to balance localization and semantics.

Result: Achieves a 7.1% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B model compared to Time-R1.

Conclusion: Invert4TVG strengthens semantic understanding and raises localization accuracy by deriving query-related actions from segments.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates BERTopic and NMF for topic modeling in strategic plan development for government organizations, finding BERTopic superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage GAI for automating strategic plan development in government, overcoming regulatory challenges.

Method: BERTopic and NMF are trained on GAO reports, with generated topics compared to Vision Elements of a strategic plan.

Result: Both models matched 100% of Vision Elements; BERTopic showed stronger correlations.

Conclusion: BERTopic is more effective for this application, with potential for broader GAI-enabled strategic planning.

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Motivation: Address the limitation of static AI agents by exploring self-evolving techniques to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces a unified framework with four key components (System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, Optimisers) and systematically reviews self-evolving techniques and domain-specific strategies.

Result: Provides a comprehensive review of self-evolving agentic systems, highlighting evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: Lays the foundation for developing more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong AI agentic systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates LLMs with multi-agent systems, improving coordination and decision-making in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and
collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated
problem-solving tasks. The establishment of a common language can serve as a
powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst
agents, facilitating desired coordination and strategies. In this work, we
extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them
with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a
systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models
(LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt
engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures,
multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through
fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive
ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social
dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.

TL;DR: A new agentic approach using a general-purpose Python coding agent based on ReAct solves all 101 CP-Bench problems by combining prompt-encoded domain expertise with dynamic code execution, outperforming fixed workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the translation of natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models is challenging due to the need for deep expertise and the limitations of fixed workflows.

Method: A pure agentic strategy with a ReAct-based Python coding agent, using a persistent IPython kernel for stateful execution and iterative development, and injecting domain expertise via prompts.

Result: Successfully solved all 101 problems in the CP-Bench benchmark set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining general coding tools and prompt-encoded expertise.

Conclusion: Constraint modeling benefits from flexible agentic approaches with dynamic tools and prompt-driven expertise, rather than rigid workflows or specialized architectures.

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A harness enables out-of-the-box LLMs to play Diplomacy without fine-tuning, using optimized game state representation and tooling for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diplomacy's complexity and high variance made it prohibitive for study without frontier LLMs or fine-tuning.

Method: Data-driven iteration optimized textual game state representation; tooling for hypothesis testing and statistical analysis was developed.

Result: Larger models performed best, but smaller ones were adequate. Critical State Analysis was introduced for deep game moment analysis.

Conclusion: The harness democratizes strategic reasoning evaluation in LLMs, showing capabilities emerge naturally without fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also

### [263] [MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575)
*Shiqing Fan,Xichen Ding,Liang Zhang,Linjian Mo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCPToolBench++, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to use MCP tools, addressing challenges like lack of datasets, diverse response formats, and context window limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for standardized evaluation of LLMs' MCP tool use due to issues like missing benchmarks, varied tool success rates, and context constraints.

Method: Proposes MCPToolBench++, a large-scale benchmark with 4k+ MCP servers across 40+ categories, testing single and multi-step tool calls.

Result: Evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on the benchmark, reporting performance metrics.

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++ addresses evaluation gaps for LLMs' MCP tool use, providing a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

### [264] [Optimization of Private Semantic Communication Performance: An Uncooperative Covert Communication Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07586)
*Wenjing Zhang,Ye Hu,Tao Luo,Zhilong Zhang,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel covert semantic communication framework is proposed, using a friendly jammer and strategic time slot selection to protect semantic information from eavesdropping. A reinforcement learning algorithm optimizes transmission quality and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect semantic information (image meaning) from eavesdropping by attackers while ensuring high transmission quality, despite limited jammer energy and no communication between server and jammer.

Method: A prioritised sampling assisted twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is used to jointly optimize transmitted semantic information and transmit power per time slot, avoiding local optima and estimation bias.

Result: Simulations show improvements of up to 77.8% in privacy and 14.3% in transmission quality compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and algorithm effectively enhance privacy and transmission quality in covert semantic communication without requiring server-jammer coordination.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

### [265] [HGMF: A Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework for Scalable Tool Invocation within the Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07602)
*Wenpeng Xing,Zhipeng Chen,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HGMF improves tool selection accuracy and reduces latency for LLMs by hierarchically pruning irrelevant options using Gaussian Mixture Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting the correct tool from large, hierarchical libraries due to limited LLM context windows and noise from irrelevant options.

Method: HGMF maps queries and tools into a semantic space, clusters and filters servers and tools hierarchically using Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: HGMF significantly improves tool selection accuracy and reduces inference latency in experiments.

Conclusion: HGMF is scalable and effective for large-scale tool libraries, enhancing LLM performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

*Aswin RRV,Jacob Dineen,Divij Handa,Md Nayem Uddin,Mihir Parmar,Chitta Baral,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkTuning is a GRPO-based interactive training method using teacher-student feedback to enhance reasoning in LLMs, showing notable improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods don't instill new reasoning abilities in LLMs but only reveal existing ones, prompting the need for a method to develop such abilities from scratch.

Method: ThinkTuning uses a teacher model to guide a student model through corrective feedback during rollouts, inspired by classroom teaching practices.

Result: The method improves reasoning by 3.85% on average over zero-shot baselines, with specific gains on MATH-500 (2.08%), AIME (2.23%), and GPQA-Diamond (3.99%).

Conclusion: ThinkTuning effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs through interactive feedback, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning
capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows
a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on
MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements
over the vanilla-GRPO baseline. Source code is available at

### [267] [Multimodal AI Systems for Enhanced Laying Hen Welfare Assessment and Productivity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07628)
*Daniel Essien,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal AI integrates diverse data streams to improve poultry welfare monitoring, with feature-level fusion being optimal. Challenges include sensor fragility and costs, addressed by new evaluation tools and a modular deployment framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional welfare checks are subjective and limited; multimodal AI can provide deeper, data-driven insights into laying hen welfare.

Method: Uses multimodal AI with feature-level fusion, introduces Domain Transfer Score (DTS) and Data Reliability Index (DRI), and proposes a modular deployment framework.

Result: Feature-level fusion balances robustness and performance; new tools (DTS, DRI) address adoption barriers like sensor fragility and generalizability.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI enables proactive, precision-driven welfare systems, merging productivity with ethical animal care.

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

*Tianyi Ma,Yue Zhang,Zehao Wang,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillNav is a modular framework for VLN that uses skill-based reasoning and a VLM-based router to improve navigation performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods struggle with generalization in unseen scenarios requiring complex reasoning.

Method: Decomposes navigation into atomic skills handled by specialized agents and uses a VLM-based router for dynamic skill selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on R2R and strong generalization on GSA-R2R.

Conclusion: SkillNav's modular, skill-based approach enhances VLN performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

*Jie Li,Haoye Dong,Zhengyang Wu,Zetao Zheng,Mingrong Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMuST is a POI recommendation model using disentangled representation learning to align spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POI recommendation models misalign spatial-temporal transitions, causing redundancy and reduced interpretability.

Method: DiMuST uses a Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE) to disentangle shared/private distributions, fuses shared features via PoE, and denoises private features with contrastive constraints.

Result: DiMuST outperforms existing methods on two datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: DiMuST effectively captures spatial-temporal transitions while preserving intrinsic correlations, improving POI recommendation.

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

*Wenkai Li,Liwen Sun,Zhenxiang Guan,Xuhui Zhou,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework improves contextual privacy in LLMs by decomposing tasks, reducing leakage by 18-19% while preserving public content fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy challenges in LLMs when processing mixed private/public information, like meeting summaries.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system for specialized subtasks (extraction, classification) and iterative validation, with ablation studies on information-flow topologies.

Result: Reduces private info leakage by 18% (ConfAIde) and 19% (PrivacyLens) with GPT-4o, outperforming single-agent baselines.

Conclusion: Principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems enhances contextual privacy for LLMs.

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

TL;DR: EMPATHIA is a multi-agent AI framework for refugee integration, addressing cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions, achieving 87.4% validation convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches focus narrowly on employment, neglecting cultural and ethical aspects critical for long-term refugee success.

Method: EMPATHIA uses three modules (SEED, RISE, THRIVE) with specialized agents for transparent, interpretable recommendations, tested on UN Kakuma dataset.

Result: Achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments across five host countries.

Conclusion: EMPATHIA balances competing values, supports human-AI collaboration, and generalizes to AI-driven allocation tasks.

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,
emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while
supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing
human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven
allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

*Gianluca Bontempi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ethics2Vec, a method to align AI decision-making with human ethical values by mapping agent strategies to vector representations, addressing the challenge of incommensurable values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The alignment of AI systems with human ethical values is difficult due to the incommensurable nature of these values, such as weighing human life against treatment costs.

Method: Extends the Anything2vec approach to ethics, mapping agent decision-making strategies to multivariate vectors for comparison and alignment assessment.

Result: Proposes Ethics2Vec for binary decision-making and extends it to automatic control laws, like in self-driving cars.

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec provides a scalable method to assess and align AI behavior with human ethical values, even for incommensurable criteria.

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

*Markus Fritzsche,Elliot Gestrin,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformers struggle with planning tasks due to problem symmetries. A contrastive learning objective is proposed to make them symmetry-aware, improving performance in plan-generation and heuristic-prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers, like PlanGPT, perform poorly in automated planning due to combinatorial explosion from problem symmetries.

Method: Introduces a contrastive learning objective and architectural improvements to make transformers symmetry-aware.

Result: Effective and efficient training for plan-generation and heuristic-prediction, outperforming PlanGPT.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware training addresses transformer limitations in automated planning.

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

### [274] [Best-Effort Policies for Robust Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07790)
*Alessandro Abate,Thom Badings,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policies for robust MDPs (RMDPs) to refine policy selection beyond worst-case optimization, ensuring better performance under non-adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard robust policies in RMDPs may not perform well under non-adversarial conditions, despite being optimal in the worst-case. The paper aims to address this gap by proposing a refined criterion inspired by game theory.

Method: The authors propose ORBE policies, which maximize worst-case expected return while also performing well under non-adversarial transition probabilities. They characterize ORBE policies and present an algorithm to compute them efficiently.

Result: ORBE policies always exist and can be computed with minimal overhead compared to standard robust value iteration. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: ORBE policies provide a principled way to break ties among optimal robust policies, improving performance under non-adversarial conditions while maintaining worst-case guarantees.

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Knowledge Graph is proposed to assist first responders with AI-driven treatment recommendations in emergency situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for efficient rescue operations and personalized healthcare in time-sensitive emergencies drives the development of an AI-assisted system.

Method: The paper introduces a Knowledge Graph as a central knowledge representation, enabling intelligent treatment recommendations through AI-based pre-recognition of situations.

Result: The system aims to improve first responders' ability to provide optimized healthcare by leveraging real-time vital data and AI-driven insights.

Conclusion: The Knowledge Graph enhances emergency care by offering timely, AI-supported recommendations, bridging gaps in first responders' knowledge.

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the
situation.

TL;DR: X-evolve is a novel method combining LLMs and EAs to evolve solution spaces, reducing LLM call costs and improving optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods evolve individual solutions, incurring high LLM call costs, limiting efficiency and scalability.

Method: X-evolve evolves solution spaces (X) using LLMs to generate tunable programs with parameters. A score-based search explores these spaces efficiently.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy in three problems: cap set (new lower bound), information theory (larger independent set), and bin packing (better heuristics).

Conclusion: Evolving solution spaces enhances search effectiveness, enabling high-dimensional problem-solving with fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

*Olivier Poulet,Frédéric Guinand,François Guérin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using LSTM for short-term position prediction and DQN for collision risk anticipation reduces collisions in constrained robot environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve collision avoidance in multi-robot systems without communication or identifiers.

Method: LSTM predicts robot positions; DQN dynamically adjusts rewards based on anticipated collision risk.

Result: Significant reduction in collisions and improved stability, even at low sampling frequency (1 Hz).

Conclusion: The method is computationally efficient and suitable for embedded systems.

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including
workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume
systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic
AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death
investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's
application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task
decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

### [279] [Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08001)
*Rui Yao,Qi Chai,Jinhai Yao,Siyuan Li,Junhao Chen,Qi Zhang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework to decode Fedspeak and classify its monetary policy stance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fedspeak encodes implicit policy signals, and automating its interpretation has significant implications for financial forecasting and policy analysis.

Method: The framework incorporates domain-specific reasoning and a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to enhance semantic representation and model reliability.

Result: The framework achieves top performance in policy stance analysis, with perceptual uncertainty correlating positively with model error rates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively deciphers Fedspeak, improving classification accuracy and reliability, with perceptual uncertainty serving as a useful diagnostic tool.

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies ontology fitting for Boolean queries, analyzing complexity for various query languages in description logics ALC and ALCI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of fitting an ontology to satisfy given positive and negative examples of Boolean queries, ensuring correctness in ontology-mediated querying.

Method: The study uses description logics ALC and ALCI, examining atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof (UCQs). It provides characterizations and computational complexity analysis.

Result: The problem is CO-NP for AQs and full CQs, and 2EXPTIME-complete for CQs and UCQs, applicable to both ALC and ALCI.

Conclusion: The paper establishes computational complexities for ontology fitting, offering insights into the feasibility of solving such problems in practice.

Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a
collection
  of positive and negative examples of
  the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with
  $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek
  an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash
q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for
all negative examples.
  We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as
ontology languages and
  a range of query languages that
  includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof
(UCQs).
  For all of the resulting fitting problems,
  we provide
  effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity
  of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be
${\small CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs
  and $2E{\small XP}T{\small IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs.
  These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.

*Runchuan Zhu,Bowen Jiang,Lingrui Mei,Fangkai Yang,Lu Wang,Haoxiang Gao,Fengshuo Bai,Pu Zhao,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdaptFlow is a meta-learning framework for LLM workflows, enabling rapid adaptation to diverse tasks through language-guided modifications, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM workflows rely on static templates or manual designs, limiting adaptability and scalability. AdaptFlow aims to address this by learning generalizable workflow initializations.

Method: Uses a bi-level optimization scheme: inner loop refines workflows for subtasks with LLM feedback; outer loop updates shared initialization for cross-task performance.

Result: Outperforms manual and automated baselines in QA, code generation, and math reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art generalization.

Conclusion: AdaptFlow demonstrates strong generalization and scalability, offering a flexible solution for LLM-based workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

### [282] [FNBT: Full Negation Belief Transformation for Open-World Information Fusion Based on Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08075)
*Meishen He,Wenjun Ma,Jiao Wang,Huijun Yue,Xiaoma Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Full Negation Belief Transformation (FNBT) for open-world information fusion, addressing heterogeneous frames in Dempster-Shafer theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with heterogeneous frames from diverse data sources, leading to unsatisfactory fusion results.

Method: Introduces FNBT: a criterion for open-world tasks, frame extension for heterogeneous elements, and a full negation mechanism for mass function transformation.

Result: FNBT satisfies theoretical properties (invariance, heritability, conflict elimination) and outperforms in real-world classification tasks.

Conclusion: FNBT effectively addresses open-world fusion challenges, validated by theoretical proofs and empirical results.

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

*Pranav Pushkar Mishra,Mohammad Arvan,Mohan Zalake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TeamMedAgents integrates human teamwork components into LLM-based medical decision-making, improving performance across 7/8 medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To translate human teamwork theories into computational multi-agent systems for better medical decision-making.

Method: Operationalizes six teamwork components (e.g., leadership, trust) in a modular architecture, evaluated on eight medical benchmarks.

Result: Consistent improvements in 7/8 datasets, with optimal teamwork configurations varying by task complexity and domain.

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents advances collaborative AI by systematically applying human teamwork theories to agentic systems.

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

*Rui Miao,Yixin Liu,Yili Wang,Xu Shen,Yue Tan,Yiwei Dai,Shirui Pan,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlindGuard is an unsupervised defense method for LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) that detects malicious agents without labeled data, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised defenses rely on labeled malicious agents, which is impractical. BlindGuard aims to provide a generalizable, label-free solution.

Method: BlindGuard uses a hierarchical agent encoder and corruption-guided detector with noise injection and contrastive learning to train on normal behaviors only.

Result: BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (prompt injection, memory poisoning, tool attack) across MAS with superior generalizability.

Conclusion: BlindGuard offers a practical, unsupervised defense for MAS security, eliminating the need for attack-specific labels.

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

*Yunkai Hu,Tianqiao Zhao,Meng Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel LLM-assisted agent converts natural-language power system optimization descriptions into solver-ready formulations, ensuring feasibility and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM use for solutions often yields infeasible or suboptimal results due to lack of numerical precision and constraint-handling.

Method: Integrates domain-aware prompts, systematic validation, and iterative repair to generate solver-ready models.

Result: Produces optimal or near-optimal solutions, enhancing reliability when coupled with task-specific validation.

Conclusion: Combining AI with optimization frameworks bridges high-level descriptions and executable models, improving energy system decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems

*Juliana Resplande Sant'anna Gomes,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to enrich Portuguese news datasets with external evidence for Semi-Automated Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems, addressing the lack of such resources in Portuguese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of disinformation exceeds manual fact-checking capabilities, necessitating SAFC systems. Portuguese lacks datasets with external evidence, crucial for robust AFC development.

Method: The methodology uses LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to extract claims from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search, FactCheck Claims) to retrieve external evidence. It includes data validation and preprocessing (e.g., near-duplicate detection).

Result: The approach enriches Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR, MuMiN-PT) with external evidence, simulating user verification processes.

Conclusion: The developed methodology fills a gap in Portuguese AFC resources, enhancing dataset quality and supporting SAFC system development.

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the
base corpora.

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic prompting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve few-shot biomedical NER performance using LLMs. It shows significant F1-score improvements over static prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance challenges of LLMs in few-shot biomedical NER by leveraging dynamic prompting with RAG.

Method: Investigate dynamic prompting with RAG, selecting in-context examples based on input text similarity and updating prompts dynamically. Evaluate on five biomedical NER datasets.

Result: Dynamic prompting outperforms static, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods improving F1-scores by 7.3% (5-shot) and 5.6% (10-shot). Static prompting also showed gains (11-12% F1).

Conclusion: Contextually adaptive prompts via RAG enhance biomedical NER performance, demonstrating the utility of dynamic prompting in few-shot settings.

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CarbonScaling, a framework extending neural scaling laws to include carbon emissions in LLM training, revealing inefficiencies and offering optimization insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked exponential carbon emissions linked to the growth of large language models (LLMs) by integrating carbon considerations into neural scaling laws.

Method: Develops CarbonScaling, combining models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation to link model accuracy to carbon footprint.

Result: Finds a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon, with real-world inefficiencies increasing scaling. Hardware scaling helps smaller models but has diminishing returns for large LLMs due to overhead and underutilization.

Conclusion: CarbonScaling provides insights for sustainable LLM training, emphasizing optimizations like critical batch size scaling to reduce inefficiencies.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the overlooked aspect of tokenization in multilingual LLMs, proposing a novel algorithm to improve efficiency and model performance, particularly for Indic scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in multilingual LLMs is understudied, leading to inefficiencies like high token-to-word ratios and slower inference. The study aims to optimize tokenization for diverse languages, focusing on Indic scripts.

Method: The study systematically analyzes vocabulary size, pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition. It introduces a novel data composition algorithm and evaluates performance on Indic scripts.

Result: The proposed tokenizer reduces the average token-to-word ratio by ~6% and achieves >40% improvement over state-of-the-art models, enhancing both performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: Tokenization is as critical as architecture and training objectives for efficient multilingual LLMs, with the proposed methods offering significant improvements.

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

TL;DR: AEALT is a supervised framework that reduces high-dimensional text embeddings from LLMs using an augmented autoencoder, improving efficiency and performance in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional text embeddings from LLMs increase computational costs and reduce efficiency in downstream tasks.

Method: AEALT extracts embeddings from text, then uses a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.

Result: AEALT outperforms conventional deep-learning methods and standard dimension reduction techniques in classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks.

Conclusion: AEALT effectively reduces embedding dimensionality while enhancing task performance, proving its broad applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuideEval, a benchmark to assess LLMs' ability to adaptively guide learners, revealing current models' shortcomings and proposing a behavior-guided finetuning strategy for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on LLMs' tutoring capabilities overlooks adaptive guidance based on learners' cognitive states, prompting this study to explore dynamic instructional strategies.

Method: The study proposes GuideEval, a three-phase framework (Perception, Orchestration, Elicitation) to evaluate LLMs' pedagogical guidance, and introduces behavior-guided finetuning using instructional dialogues.

Result: Existing LLMs often fail in adaptive scaffolding, but behavior-guided finetuning significantly improves their guidance performance.

Conclusion: The study advocates a dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs, emphasizing learner-centered interaction over isolated content evaluation.

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method to generate high-quality forget sets for post-hoc unlearning in large language models, using synthetic textbook-style data created by the models themselves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often encode sensitive or harmful knowledge, necessitating efficient unlearning methods without full retraining. Current approaches struggle with creating effective forget sets.

Method: A scalable, automated pipeline synthesizes textbook-style forget sets using structured prompts, requiring only a domain name as input.

Result: The synthetic datasets outperform baseline alternatives and match expert-curated ones in unlearning tasks like biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels. Data diversity from the multi-step pipeline enhances unlearning utility.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets enable practical, scalable unlearning for emerging domains without manual intervention, with code and data released for public use.

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark for evaluating deep-research agents, addressing limitations of current benchmarks like fairness and transparency by using a fixed corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for deep-research agents rely on dynamic web APIs, hindering fair comparisons and reproducibility. BrowseComp-Plus aims to provide controlled experimentation.

Method: BrowseComp-Plus is derived from BrowseComp, featuring a fixed corpus with human-verified documents and challenging negatives. It evaluates systems like Search-R1 and GPT-5 with retrievers like BM25 and Qwen3-Embedding-8B.

Result: GPT-5 achieves 55.9% accuracy, improving to 70.1% with Qwen3-Embedding-8B, outperforming Search-R1 (3.86%). The benchmark effectively distinguishes system performance.

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus enables controlled evaluation of deep-research agents, offering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering.

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

### [294] [Train It and Forget It: Merge Lists are Unnecessary for BPE Inference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06621)
*Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of BPE inference algorithms that avoid merge lists, finding minimal performance degradation in non-targeted methods compared to targeted deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work highlights merge lists as a vulnerability for training data extraction, prompting investigation into merge-list-free BPE inference.

Method: Two classes of BPE inference schemes are tested: targeted deviations (random/corrupted merge lists) and non-targeted methods (greedy/exact compression without merge lists).

Result: Targeted deviations degrade performance significantly, while non-targeted methods show minimal impact on tasks like QA, translation, and generation.

Conclusion: Non-targeted merge-list-free BPE inference offers simpler, privacy-preserving tokenization without major performance loss.

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

### [295] [Measuring Stereotype and Deviation Biases in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06649)
*Daniel Wang,Eli Brignac,Minjia Mao,Xiao Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates stereotype and deviation biases in LLMs, revealing significant biases in demographic associations and disparities in generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and analyze biases in LLMs, focusing on stereotype and deviation biases, to highlight potential risks in their applications.

Method: Profiles of individuals were generated by four advanced LLMs to examine associations between demographic groups and attributes like political affiliation, religion, and sexual orientation.

Result: All examined LLMs displayed significant stereotype and deviation biases towards multiple demographic groups.

Conclusion: The findings expose biases in LLM-generated outputs, emphasizing potential harms and the need for addressing these issues in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

### [296] [Testing the Limits of Machine Translation from One Book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06665)
*Jonathan Shaw,Dillon Mee,Timothy Khouw,Zackary Leech,Daniel Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs improve translation for low-resource languages like Kanuri using parallel sentences, but grammar alone is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can translate Kanuri, a language with minimal digital resources, using different language materials.

Method: Evaluated LLM translation with datasets of health/humanitarian terms and generalized terminology, comparing grammar, dictionary, and parallel sentences.

Result: Parallel sentences outperformed other methods; grammar improved zero-shot but was ineffective alone. LLMs excelled in accuracy over fluency.

Conclusion: Multidimensional evaluation is needed for LLM translation, and grammar alone lacks context for effective domain-specific translation.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

### [297] [Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06671)
*Swati Rajwal,Shivank Garg,Reem Abdel-Salam,Abdelrahman Zayed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if biased language models exhibit biased thoughts using chain-of-thought prompting, finding low correlation between thought and output biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if biased decisions in language models stem from biased intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: Experiments on 5 large language models using fairness metrics to quantify 11 biases in thoughts and outputs.

Result: Low correlation (<0.6) between thought and output biases, with p-values <0.001 in most cases.

Conclusion: Biased models don't always have biased thoughts, unlike humans.

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

*Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Riccardo Fogliato,Hanna Burnsky,Tamer Soliman,Jie Ma,Graham Horwood,Miguel Ballesteros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework to identify and quantify self-bias in LLM judges, showing models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet favor their own outputs and related models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of self-bias in LLM evaluations, where models may unfairly rate their own outputs higher, distorting performance assessments.

Method: A statistical framework to model scoring distribution differences between self and other model outputs, validated with human annotations and LLM judgments.

Result: Some models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, exhibit self-bias and family-bias, favoring their own and related model outputs.

Conclusion: Highlights risks of LLM judges and provides guidance to mitigate biases in automated evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

### [299] [Large Language Models for Oral History Understanding with Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06729)
*Komala Subramanyam Cherukuri,Pranav Abishai Moses,Aisa Sakata,Jiangping Chen,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable framework using LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama, Qwen) for semantic and sentiment annotation of Japanese American Incarceration Oral History, achieving high accuracy and providing a reusable pipeline for culturally sensitive archival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral histories are crucial for marginalized communities but challenging to analyze at scale due to unstructured data and high annotation costs. This work aims to automate annotation while addressing ethical concerns.

Method: The study combines expert annotation, prompt engineering, and LLM evaluation (ChatGPT, Llama, Qwen) to classify sentiment and semantics in oral histories, testing zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies.

Result: ChatGPT led in semantic classification (88.71% F1), while Llama slightly outperformed in sentiment analysis (82.66%). The framework annotated 92,191 sentences, proving LLMs' effectiveness with well-designed prompts.

Conclusion: LLMs can responsibly automate large-scale oral history analysis, bridging archival ethics and NLP scalability. The study offers practical guidance and a reusable pipeline for digital humanities.

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

*Xianjun Yang,Liqiang Xiao,Shiyang Li,Faisal Ladhak,Hyokun Yun,Linda Ruth Petzold,Yi Xu,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-turn jailbreaking in LLMs, a more serious threat than single-turn jailbreaking, and introduces MTJ-Bench for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreaking focuses on single-turn attacks, but LLMs handle long contexts and multi-turn conversations, posing a greater risk.

Method: Proposes multi-turn jailbreaking and constructs MTJ-Bench to benchmark open- and closed-source models.

Result: Reveals a new vulnerability in LLMs, highlighting the need for safer models.

Conclusion: Calls for community efforts to address multi-turn jailbreaking and improve LLM safety.

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

*Ziqi Liu,Yangbin Chen,Ziyang Zhou,Yilin Li,Mingxuan Hu,Yushan Pan,Zhijie Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEVADE is a self-evolving multi-agent framework for sarcasm detection, using dynamic reasoning and decoupled evaluation to improve accuracy and reduce hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sarcasm detection are limited by single-perspective analysis and susceptibility to hallucination, impacting reliability.

Method: Proposes SEVADE with a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE) and a rationale adjudicator (RA) for decoupled evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 6.75% higher Accuracy and 6.29% higher Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: SEVADE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved sarcasm detection through multi-agent reasoning and decoupled evaluation.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

*Steven Coyne,Diana Galvan-Sosa,Ryan Spring,Camélia Guerraoui,Michael Zock,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an annotation framework for AWE systems to provide better feedback for language learners by classifying error types and generalizability, and evaluates LLM-based feedback generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AWE systems lack optimal design for language learning, favoring direct corrections over explanatory feedback that aids learning.

Method: An annotation framework models error types and generalizability, and a dataset of annotated learner errors with human feedback is collected. Feedback generation methods (keyword-guided, keyword-free, template-guided) using LLMs are evaluated.

Result: Human teachers assessed the feedback systems for relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility, with comparative performance reported.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset support improved feedback generation for language learning, with LLM-based methods showing promise.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic label alignment method for merging NER datasets, combining empirical and semantic similarities to enhance performance in low-resource domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NER relies on large annotated datasets, which are costly to create. Current merging methods lack interpretability and scalability.

Method: Uses label similarity (empirical and semantic) with a greedy pairwise merging strategy to unify label spaces across datasets.

Result: Successfully merges datasets with minimal performance impact and improves NER in the financial domain.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source NER corpora.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of answering complex questions involving heterogeneous data sources while ensuring human comprehensibility and trust.

Method: Recursively decomposes questions, builds an operator tree, and uses fine-tuned light-weight language models for execution.

Result: Demonstrates rich functionality for advanced questions and detailed answer tracing.

Conclusion: ReQAP effectively handles complex queries with transparency, enhancing user trust.

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in
calendar, shopping records or fitness tools, to unstructured contents in mail
and social media posts. This works presents the ReQAP system that supports
users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and
aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it
recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for
execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make
smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the
execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is
vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

*Arpita Saggar,Jonathan C. Darling,Vania Dimitrova,Duygu Sarikaya,David C. Hogg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SBS (Score-Before-Speaking) improves persona-based dialogue generation by unifying response learning and quality scoring, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing persona fidelity in dialogues is challenging due to limited data diversity.

Method: SBS trains models to correlate augmented responses with quality scores, using noun substitution and semantic similarity.

Result: SBS outperforms previous methods, improving persona-consistent dialogues in benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Score-conditioned training is superior, enabling better persona capture in dialogue models.

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

*Siyuan Li,Xi Lin,Guangyan Li,Zehao Liu,Aodu Wulianghai,Li Ding,Jun Wu,Jianhua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SentiDetect is a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated text by analyzing sentiment distribution stability, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods for LLM-generated text lack generalizability and are vulnerable to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. SentiDetect addresses this by leveraging emotional consistency in LLM outputs.

Method: SentiDetect uses two metrics—sentiment distribution consistency and preservation—to quantify stability under transformations. It evaluates these on diverse datasets and advanced LLMs.

Result: SentiDetect achieves over 16% and 11% F1 score improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively, and shows robustness to adversarial attacks and paraphrasing.

Conclusion: SentiDetect provides a superior, robust solution for detecting LLM-generated text by focusing on sentiment stability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score
improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover,
SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks,
and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of Quranic QA due to linguistic complexity and semantic richness in low-resource settings.

Method: Two-stage approach: ensemble fine-tuned models for passage retrieval and instruction-tuned LLMs with few-shot prompting for answer extraction.

Result: Achieved MAP@10 of 0.3128, MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and pAP@10 of 0.669 for extraction, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: Combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned LLMs effectively tackles low-resource QA in specialized domains.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage
retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned
Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of
0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These
results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned
language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question
answering in specialized domains.

### [309] [Rethinking 1-bit Optimization Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06974)
*Zhijun Tu,Hanting Chen,Siqi Liu,Chuanjian Liu,Jian Li,Jie Hu,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for 1-bit LLM quantization that leverages pre-trained models, reducing training costs and accuracy loss compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 1-bit LLM quantization methods train from scratch, leading to high costs and accuracy degradation. The gap between full precision and 1-bit representations makes adaptation challenging.

Method: The proposed method uses consistent progressive training for forward and backward passes, binary-aware initialization, and dual-scaling compensation to smoothly convert floating-point weights to 1-bit.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches, achieving high-performance 1-bit LLMs without expensive training from scratch.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that pre-trained models can be effectively adapted to 1-bit quantization, offering cost and performance benefits.

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

### [310] [Vec2Summ: Text Summarization via Probabilistic Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07017)
*Mao Li,Fred Conrad,Johann Gagnon-Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Summ is a method for abstractive summarization using semantic compression via mean vectors and embedding inversion, with stochastic sampling for varied outputs. It addresses LLM limitations, offering scalability and semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome context-length constraints and improve interpretability and scalability in LLM-based summarization methods.

Method: Represents documents as a mean vector in semantic space, performs embedding inversion with a generative model, and introduces stochasticity via Gaussian sampling.

Result: Produces coherent summaries comparable to direct LLM methods, with better scalability and semantic control but less fine-grained detail.

Conclusion: Vec2Summ is effective for scalable, semantically controlled summarization, especially in corpus-level abstraction settings.

Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames
the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection
using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

TL;DR: SEADialogues is a culturally grounded dialogue dataset for Southeast Asia, addressing the lack of cultural nuance in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chit-chat datasets ignore cultural nuances, limiting their applicability in diverse regions like Southeast Asia.

Method: The dataset includes dialogues in eight languages from six countries, with persona attributes and culturally grounded topics.

Result: SEADialogues enhances cultural relevance and supports research on culturally aware language models.

Conclusion: This dataset advances human-centric and culturally aware dialogue systems, particularly for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems,
most existing chit-chat datasets overlook the cultural nuances inherent in
natural human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a
culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with
over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features
dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which
are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance
cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona
attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the
respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset
to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language
models, including conversational dialogue agents.

*Aditya Tomar,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BharatBBQ is a culturally adapted benchmark for evaluating biases in Indian languages, addressing gaps in existing Western-centric benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias benchmarks like BBQ focus on Western contexts, limiting their relevance to India. BharatBBQ aims to fill this gap by assessing biases in Indian languages.

Method: The benchmark covers 13 social categories, including intersectional groups, and expands 49,108 examples to 392,864 across eight languages via translation and verification. Five multilingual LM families are evaluated in zero and few-shot settings.

Result: Persistent biases are found across languages and social categories, often amplified in Indian languages compared to English.

Conclusion: Culturally and linguistically grounded benchmarks like BharatBBQ are essential for comprehensive bias evaluation in diverse contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

### [313] [Less Is More: Training-Free Sparse Attention with Global Locality for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07101)
*Lijie Yang,Zhihao Zhang,Arti Jain,Shijie Cao,Baihong Yuan,Yiwei Chen,Zhihao Jia,Ravi Netravali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LessIsMore is a training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks that improves efficiency and accuracy by leveraging global attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention methods degrade accuracy or require expensive retraining, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local attention heads with contextual information, enabling unified cross-head token ranking.

Result: It achieves a 1.1× decoding speed-up, attends to 2× fewer tokens without accuracy loss, and outperforms existing sparse methods with a 1.13× end-to-end speed-up.

Conclusion: LessIsMore effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

### [314] [Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07111)
*Falaah Arif Khan,Nivedha Sivakumar,Yinong Oliver Wang,Katherine Metcalf,Cezanne Camacho,Barry-John Theobald,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines intersectional bias in LLMs, introducing a new benchmark (WinoIdentity) and a metric (Coreference Confidence Disparity) to evaluate bias across multiple demographic attributes. Findings reveal significant confidence disparities, suggesting LLMs rely on memorization over reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about AI systems reflecting societal biases, especially in critical contexts like hiring, by extending bias evaluation to intersectional identities.

Method: Augment WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, creating 245,700 prompts. Propose Coreference Confidence Disparity metric to measure bias in model confidence.

Result: LLMs show confidence disparities up to 40% across attributes like body type and socio-economic status, with higher uncertainty for disadvantaged identities. Models' performance may stem from memorization, not reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant intersectional bias, with failures in value alignment and validity, potentially compounding social harm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

### [315] [Fairness of Automatic Speech Recognition: Looking Through a Philosophical Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07143)
*Anna Seo Gyeong Choi,Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores ASR bias as a form of disrespect to marginalized linguistic communities, highlighting ethical dimensions like temporal taxation and identity disruption, and calls for recognizing diverse speech varieties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on fairness implications of ASR systems and their impact on marginalized linguistic communities.

Method: Philosophical analysis distinguishing between neutral classification and harmful discrimination, identifying unique ethical dimensions of ASR bias.

Result: ASR bias reinforces power imbalances and historical injustices, requiring more than technical fixes to address.

Conclusion: ASR systems must respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy, moving beyond technical solutions to embrace ethical considerations.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

### [316] [Gradient Surgery for Safe LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07172)
*Biao Yi,Jiahao Li,Baolei Zhang,Lihai Nie,Tong Li,Tiansheng Huang,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeGrad, a gradient surgery-based method, addresses vulnerabilities in fine-tuning LLMs by resolving conflicting gradients between user tasks and safety alignment, ensuring robust safety without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to malicious examples, degrading safety alignment as harmful ratios increase due to conflicting gradients.

Method: SafeGrad uses gradient surgery to nullify harmful components of user-task gradients by projecting them orthogonally to alignment gradients, alongside a KL-divergence alignment loss for robustness.

Result: SafeGrad achieves state-of-the-art defense, maintaining safety at high harmful ratios without losing task performance.

Conclusion: SafeGrad effectively resolves gradient conflicts in fine-tuning, ensuring robust safety alignment for LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni-SafetyBench, the first benchmark for evaluating safety in Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. It proposes tailored metrics and reveals critical vulnerabilities in current OLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the ability to assess safety in OLLMs under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal consistency, necessitating a dedicated solution.

Method: The authors introduce Omni-SafetyBench, featuring 24 modality combinations with 972 samples each, and propose metrics like Safety-score (C-ASR, C-RR) and CMSC-score for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Evaluation of 10 OLLMs shows vulnerabilities: no model excels in both safety and consistency, defenses weaken with complex inputs, and severe weaknesses exist in specific modalities.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights urgent needs for improved OLLM safety and provides a foundation for future enhancements.

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHG-DIF, a framework for personalized headline generation that addresses click noise in historical behaviors to improve headline quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to account for personalized-irrelevant click noise, leading to inaccurate headlines.

Method: PHG-DIF uses dual-stage filtering to remove noise (short dwell times, abnormal clicks) and multi-level temporal fusion to model evolving user interests.

Result: PHG-DIF achieves SOTA results on the DT-PENS dataset, mitigating noise effects and improving headline quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses click noise and enhances personalized headline generation, supported by a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for automated extraction of fine-grained schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipelines is proposed, addressing semantic drift. It introduces SLiCE for evaluation and benchmarks performance across language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic drift in enterprise data pipelines compromises reproducibility and governance, affecting services like RAG and text-to-SQL.

Method: The framework extracts schema lineage by identifying source schemas, tables, transformation logic, and aggregations, using SLiCE for evaluation. Tests were conducted on 12 language models.

Result: Performance scales with model size and prompting techniques; a 32B open-source model matches GPT series under standard prompting.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, economical solution for deploying schema-aware agents in practice.

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DySK-Attn is a framework enabling LLMs to integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic KG using sparse attention, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' static knowledge becomes outdated quickly, and retraining or editing them is costly or slow.

Method: Synergizes LLMs with a dynamic KG using a sparse knowledge attention mechanism for efficient, relevant fact retrieval.

Result: Outperforms baselines like RAG and model editing in accuracy and efficiency for time-sensitive tasks.

Conclusion: DySK-Attn provides a scalable solution for keeping LLMs updated with real-time knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALON enhances LLM-based time series forecasting by addressing temporal heterogeneity and modality gaps, achieving superior performance with 11% MSE improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of LLMs to time series forecasting is hindered by temporal heterogeneity and modality gaps between numerical signals and language representations.

Method: TALON uses a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder for localized modeling and a Semantic Alignment Module to bridge the modality gap.

Result: TALON outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with up to 11% MSE improvement on seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: TALON effectively adapts LLMs for forecasting by combining pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

### [322] [Enhancing Rumor Detection Methods with Propagation Structure Infused Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07209)
*Chaoqun Cui,Siyuan Li,Kunkun Ma,Caiyan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Post Engagement Prediction (PEP), a pretraining strategy to improve PLMs for rumor detection by modeling propagation structures and social interactions. It introduces datasets and a tailored PLM, SoLM, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs underperform in social media tasks like rumor detection due to mismatches with pretraining corpora, inadequate handling of social symbols, and unsuitable pretraining tasks for user engagements.

Method: PEP involves predicting post relations (root, branch, parent) to capture stance and sentiment interactions. It uses curated datasets (TwitterCorpus, UTwitter, UWeibo) and trains SoLM.

Result: PEP boosts rumor detection accuracy by 1.0-3.7%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SoLM achieves competitive results without high-level modules.

Conclusion: PEP effectively enhances PLMs for rumor detection by learning post interaction features, validated by improved performance and competitive standalone results of SoLM.

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post

### [323] [How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07229)
*Itai Allouche,Itay Asael,Rotem Rousso,Vered Dassa,Ann Bradlow,Seung-Eun Kim,Matthew Goldrick,Joseph Keshet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates interpretability of neural networks in predicting lexical stress, using CNNs and Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to analyze spectral cues like formants and pitch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what informs neural network decisions in speech processing, specifically for lexical stress prediction, and to interpret their behavior.

Method: Constructed a dataset of English disyllabic words, trained CNN architectures to predict stress, and used LRP for interpretability analysis.

Result: Achieved 92% accuracy; LRP revealed reliance on spectral properties of stressed vowels (e.g., formants, pitch) and distributed word cues.

Conclusion: Deep learning can learn distributed stress cues from natural data, complementing traditional phonetic studies.

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

*Zhe Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Few-Shot Continual Learning Named Entity Recognition (FS-CLNER) by introducing prompt tuning and memory demonstration templates to avoid the Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of new-class entities and lack of old-class entity information in FS-CLNER tasks hinder knowledge distillation and model generalization, leading to the Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma.

Method: The authors propose an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning (APT) paradigm and Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning and provide replay samples from previous tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate competitive performance on FS-CLNER tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed APT and MDT strategies effectively address the challenges of FS-CLNER, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enhancing few-shot learning.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning
Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on
old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a
form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in
Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

### [325] [The 2D+ Dynamic Articulatory Model DYNARTmo: Tongue-Palate Contact Area Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07262)
*Bernd J. Kröger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends a 2D dynamic articulatory model (DYNARTmo) by adding a 3D palatal dome representation to estimate tongue-palate contact areas. It uses two dome geometries (half-ellipse and cosine-based) for lateral curvature modeling, enabling electropalatography-like visualizations. The model supports synchronized 2D+ views for education and therapy, with plans for future enhancements like facial views and acoustic synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the estimation of tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal tongue contours by integrating a 3D palatal dome representation into a 2D dynamic articulatory model.

Method: Implemented two alternative dome geometries (half-ellipse and cosine-based) to model lateral curvature, analytically computed lateral contact points, and generated electropalatography-like visualizations within a 2D+ framework.

Result: The enhanced model provides synchronized sagittal, glottal, and palatal views for static and dynamic articulation displays, useful for speech science education and therapy.

Conclusion: The extended model improves visualization and educational tools for speech science, with future work aimed at adding facial views and articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis for realism evaluation.

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

### [326] [Incorporating Contextual Paralinguistic Understanding in Large Speech-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07273)
*Qiongqiong Wang,Hardik B. Sailor,Jeremy H. M. Wong,Tianchi Liu,Shuo Sun,Wenyu Zhang,Muhammad Huzaifah,Nancy Chen,Ai Ti Aw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in empathetic reasoning of Speech-LLMs by proposing explicit and implicit methods to integrate contextual paralinguistic cues, improving performance by 38.41% (implicit) and 46.02% (combined).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-LLMs lack empathetic reasoning due to missing training datasets with contextual and paralinguistic cues.

Method: Two approaches: (1) explicit (paralinguistic metadata input) and (2) implicit (automated QA pair generation with emotion annotations).

Result: Implicit method improves performance by 38.41%; combined with explicit, it reaches 46.02%. LLM judge reliability is validated.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance contextual paralinguistic understanding in Speech-LLMs, validated by performance gains and LLM judge reliability.

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

*Vasudha Varadarajan,Hui Xu,Rebecca Astrid Boehme,Mariam Marlan Mirstrom,Sverker Sikstrom,H. Andrew Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAQuA is an adaptive framework for efficient mental health screening using LLMs, reducing question burden by 50-87% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency and user burden in LLM-based mental health assessments by optimizing question selection.

Method: Combines multi-outcome modeling, IRT, and factor analysis to select the most informative questions for multidimensional screening.

Result: Reduces questions needed by 50-87%, achieving stable scores faster (e.g., 71% fewer for depression).

Conclusion: MAQuA is a scalable, efficient tool for nuanced mental health screening, enhancing LLM integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

*Junchen Ding,Penghao Jiang,Zihao Xu,Ziqi Ding,Yichen Zhu,Jiaojiao Jiang,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 14 LLMs on moral reasoning using trolley problems, revealing variability in alignment with human ethics and advocating for moral reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' moral reasoning is critical as they mediate ethically sensitive decisions.

Method: Empirical evaluation of 14 LLMs across 27 trolley scenarios using factorial prompting, analyzing decisions and justifications.

Result: Models show variability in ethical alignment; reasoning-enhanced models are decisive but not always human-aligned. 'Sweet zones' exist in altruism, fairness, and virtue ethics.

Conclusion: Moral prompting is both a modifier and diagnostic tool; moral reasoning should be a primary axis in LLM alignment with standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

*Jian Chen,Jinbao Tian,Yankui Li,Zhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARCE introduces a method to enhance NER in the AEC domain by using LLMs to generate simple explanations (Cote) for incremental pre-training of RoBERTa, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pre-trained models struggle with domain-specific terminology in AEC texts, and manual curation is costly. ARCE explores automated knowledge generation to bridge this gap.

Method: ARCE uses an LLM to generate simple explanations (Cote), then incrementally pre-trains RoBERTa with this corpus before fine-tuning for NER.

Result: ARCE achieves a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%, outperforming existing methods and showing simple explanations are more effective than complex rationales.

Conclusion: ARCE demonstrates the effectiveness of simple, explanation-based knowledge for enhancing domain-specific NER, offering a cost-efficient alternative to manual curation.

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is
publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

*Yexing Du,Kaiyuan Liu,Youcheng Pan,Zheng Chu,Bo Yang,Xiaocheng Feng,Yang Xiang,Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCFQA, a benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality in MLLMs, addressing gaps in multilingual and speech-based evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs focus on English and textual/visual modalities, neglecting multilingual and speech inputs, which limits their reliability in diverse settings.

Method: The authors propose CCFQA, a benchmark with parallel speech-text questions in 8 languages, and a few-shot transfer learning strategy to adapt English QA capabilities to multilingual SQA tasks.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle with CCFQA, but the proposed few-shot method achieves competitive performance with minimal training.

Conclusion: CCFQA is released as a resource to enhance MLLMs' multilingual and speech understanding, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: The paper introduces ObfusQA, a framework to test LLM robustness against obfuscated questions, revealing their limitations in handling nuanced variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' robustness when faced with obfuscated questions, a gap not addressed in existing studies.

Method: Proposes ObfusQAte, a technique, and ObfusQA framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels across three dimensions: Named-Entity Indirection, Distractor Indirection, and Contextual Overload.

Result: LLMs often fail or hallucinate when dealing with obfuscated questions.

Conclusion: ObfusQA provides a benchmark for LLM robustness, highlighting their limitations, and the framework is made publicly available to encourage further research.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

TL;DR: A chatbot was developed to study code-switching in Spanish-English bilinguals during a Map Task, revealing that predictable code-switching is preferred over random or ungrammatical patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the characteristics of code-switched language and investigate bilingual language use through technology.

Method: A chatbot was programmed to code-switch in Spanish and English during a Map Task, with variations in discourse and grammatical patterns tested in two experiments.

Result: Participants preferred predictable code-switching and performed better with it, while random or ungrammatical code-switching reduced enjoyment and task success.

Conclusion: The study highlights the risks of underdeveloped multilingual technology but also its potential for bilingual language research.

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

TL;DR: FD-SLMs enable real-time spoken interactions but degrade in conversational quality due to speech sequence length and data scarcity. TurnGuide, a planning-inspired method, improves FD-SLMs by segmenting speech into turns and generating text guidance, enhancing conversational flow and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of conversational abilities in FD-SLMs caused by prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data.

Method: Proposes TurnGuide, a planning-inspired approach that segments assistant speech into dialogue turns and generates turn-level text guidance before speech output.

Result: TurnGuide significantly improves FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling semantically meaningful and coherent speech with natural flow.

Conclusion: TurnGuide effectively resolves timing and length challenges in FD-SLMs, enhancing their performance in real-time spoken interactions.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underperformance of MLLMs in low-resource languages and misinterpretation of long-tail cultural entities.

Method: Leveraging Wikidata to create a culturally rich dataset (CulturalGround) and training an MLLM (CulturalPangea) with it.

Result: CulturalPangea outperforms prior models by 5.0 on culture-focused benchmarks while maintaining performance on mainstream tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted cultural grounding narrows the cultural gap in MLLMs, promoting globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoc, a local search framework for code generation, outperforms existing methods by combining step-by-step revisions with a specialized reward model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing efficiency and scalability challenges in LLM-based code generation, particularly the limitations of construction-based and improvement-based methods.

Method: ReLoc uses a unified local search framework with four components: initial drafting, neighborhood generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent updating, guided by a revision reward model.

Result: Superior performance in diverse code generation tasks, surpassing tree-search and improvement-based methods.

Conclusion: ReLoc offers an effective solution for efficient and scalable code generation through local search and fine-grained reward signals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

*Blerta Veseli,Julian Chibane,Mariya Toneva,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates positional biases in LLMs, finding the Lost in the Middle effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of the context window. Beyond this, recency bias dominates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify inconsistent findings about positional biases (e.g., Lost in the Middle effect) in LLMs and understand their intensity and manifestation conditions.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive analysis using relative input lengths (relative to each model's context window) to study positional biases.

Result: The Lost in the Middle effect is strongest for inputs up to 50% of the context window. Beyond this, recency bias persists, and retrieval success is key for reasoning.

Conclusion: Positional biases in reasoning stem from retrieval performance, impacting long-context tasks, benchmark design, and evaluation methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

### [338] [ALOPE: Adaptive Layer Optimization for Translation Quality Estimation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07484)
*Archchana Sindhujan,Shenbin Qian,Chan Chi Chun Matthew,Constantin Orasan,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALOPE is an adaptive layer-optimization framework enhancing LLM-based Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation by restructuring Transformer representations and integrating low-rank adapters with regression task heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based QE systems face challenges due to their pre-training for causal language modeling, not regression tasks, and struggles with low-resource languages.

Method: ALOPE uses layer-wise adaptation, dynamic weighting, and multi-head regression to improve cross-lingual alignment and QE performance.

Result: ALOPE outperforms existing LLM-based QE approaches, with intermediate Transformer layers proving most effective for cross-lingual QE.

Conclusion: ALOPE advances LLM-based QE, offering scalable solutions and publicly available models for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

*Keshav Varadarajan,Tananun Songdechakraiwut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using topological data analysis identifies bias-concentrated attention heads in GPT-2, aiding future de-biasing efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias detection methods lack tools to pinpoint specific parts of large language models responsible for bias toward certain groups.

Method: Topological data analysis is applied to identify attention heads in GPT-2 contributing to bias in the StereoSet dataset.

Result: Biases (e.g., gender, profession) are concentrated in specific attention heads acting as hot spots.

Conclusion: The proposed metric can help identify bias sources and may aid in de-biasing large language models.

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the
level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which
parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific
groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

*Joseph T. Colonel,Baihan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThemeClouds is a tool using LLMs to create thematic word clouds from dialogue transcripts, improving on traditional frequency-based methods by focusing on participant-weighted themes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional word clouds fail in conversational contexts by highlighting filler words and fragmenting ideas, limiting their usefulness for early-stage qualitative analysis.

Method: ThemeClouds prompts LLMs to identify concept-level themes and counts unique participant mentions, creating visualizations based on breadth of mention.

Result: ThemeClouds outperforms frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines in surfacing actionable insights from user study transcripts.

Conclusion: The tool offers transparency, control, and new opportunities for interactive qualitative analysis, though design trade-offs with LLM integration remain.

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

*Jia Deng,Jie Chen,Zhipeng Chen,Daixuan Cheng,Fei Bai,Beichen Zhang,Yinqian Min,Yanzipeng Gao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates exploration behaviors in RLVR for LLMs, focusing on space shaping, entropy-performance exchange, and performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the exploration mechanisms in RLVR, which are critical for refining LLMs' reasoning chains.

Method: Systematic study of exploration capacities, including quantitative metrics for capability boundaries, entropy-performance analysis, and optimization techniques.

Result: Provides empirical evidence and a framework to enhance RLVR systems by translating exploration gains into measurable improvements.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for advancing RLVR by unifying insights and empirical findings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

*Puspesh Kumar Srivastava,Uddeshya Raj,Praveen Patel,/Shubham Kumar Nigam,Noel Shallum,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBPS, an AI system to predict bail outcomes in Indian courts, addressing delays and inconsistencies. It uses a dataset of 150,430 bail judgments and fine-tunes a language model, showing improved accuracy with statutory context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bail decisions in India are subjective and delayed, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups and worsening judicial backlog. IBPS aims to provide fair, data-driven bail adjudication.

Method: The authors curate a large dataset of bail judgments, annotate structured attributes, and fine-tune a language model with parameter-efficient techniques. They evaluate performance with and without statutory context and RAG.

Result: Models with statutory knowledge outperform baselines, achieving high accuracy and explanation quality, and generalize well to expert-annotated test data.

Conclusion: IBPS is a scalable, transparent solution to reduce bail delays and improve fairness in India's judicial system.

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated
by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible
solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and
promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

*Ziheng Li,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KeyCP++ improves one-shot event detection in LLMs by using keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting to address over-interpretation and lack of trigger understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with event detection due to poor trigger understanding and over-interpretation, which in-context examples alone cannot fix.

Method: KeyCP++ introduces a keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach, annotating logical gaps and using trigger discrimination to generate meaningful rationale.

Result: Experiments show KeyCP++ significantly advances one-shot event detection performance.

Conclusion: KeyCP++ effectively mitigates LLM weaknesses in event detection by promoting rule learning and reducing keyword over-reliance.

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InterChart is a benchmark evaluating vision-language models' reasoning across multiple related charts, revealing their limitations in complex, multi-chart tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating VLMs' ability to reason across diverse, related charts, crucial for real-world applications like scientific reporting and financial analysis.

Method: Organizes tasks into three difficulty tiers: factual reasoning, integrative analysis, and semantic inference over real-world chart pairs. Evaluates VLMs' performance on these tasks.

Result: VLMs show declining accuracy as chart complexity increases, performing better when charts are decomposed into simpler units.

Conclusion: InterChart highlights VLMs' struggles with cross-chart integration and provides a framework for improving multimodal reasoning in complex visual environments.

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

*Luyao Zhuang,Qinggang Zhang,Huachi Zhou,Juhua Liu,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoSemB introduces a logic-guided framework for inductive tool retrieval, addressing distribution shifts and similarity-based retrieval issues for unseen tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume all tools are observed during training, which is unrealistic as tool repositories evolve. LoSemB aims to handle unseen tools without costly retraining.

Method: LoSemB uses logic-based embedding alignment to mitigate distribution shifts and a relational augmented retrieval mechanism to improve retrieval robustness.

Result: LoSemB achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining effectiveness in transductive settings.

Conclusion: LoSemB provides a practical solution for inductive tool retrieval by leveraging logical information from prior experience.

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Commercial LLMs struggle with Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) in low-structured domains, despite strong performance in other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can maintain long-range coherence and plan ahead beyond single-token prediction (NTP).

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash on MSP across narrative, procedural, and expository domains.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack explicit mechanisms for global coherence, highlighting a gap in their capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the causal link between social bias and faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs, using SCM and a new dataset (BID) to isolate and measure effects. Results show biases significantly cause hallucinations, with varying directional impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if social bias contributes to faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs, a relationship not previously explored, while addressing confounder challenges.

Method: Uses Structural Causal Model (SCM) to establish causality, designs bias interventions, and develops the Bias Intervention Dataset (BID) for precise measurement.

Result: Biases are significant causes of hallucinations in LLMs, with varying directional effects. Unfairness hallucinations are particularly influenced by social bias.

Conclusion: Social bias has a subtle yet significant causal effect on hallucination generation in LLMs, highlighting the need for bias-aware interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a grammar-based chunking method for semantic segmentation and SASST, an end-to-end framework for simultaneous speech translation, showing improved translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic fragmentation in input streams and optimize translation timing and content in simultaneous speech translation.

Method: Grammar-based chunking using dependency relations and punctuation, integrated into SASST with a frozen Whisper encoder and decoder-only LLM.

Result: Significant translation quality improvements on CoVoST2 multilingual corpus (En-{De, Zh, Ja}).

Conclusion: Syntactic structures enhance LLM-driven simultaneous speech translation, validated by multilingual experiments.

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on
CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation
quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of
syntactic structures in LLM-driven SimulST systems.

TL;DR: Grove MoE introduces a heterogeneous expert architecture for LLMs, improving efficiency by dynamically activating parameters based on input complexity, achieving performance comparable to SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE architectures use uniform-sized experts, limiting computational efficiency by activating fixed parameters regardless of input complexity.

Method: Introduces Grove MoE with varying expert sizes and a dynamic activation mechanism, applied to 33B-parameter LLMs (GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst).

Result: Models activate 3.14-3.28B parameters dynamically, matching performance of SOTA open-source models of similar or larger size.

Conclusion: Grove MoE enhances scalability and efficiency in LLMs by adapting to input complexity, maintaining high performance.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

*Yerin Hwang,Dongryeol Lee,Taegwan Kang,Yongil Kim,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persuasive language biases LLM judges in scoring math tasks, inflating incorrect solutions by up to 8%. Larger models don't fix this, and combining techniques worsens bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if persuasive language can unfairly influence LLM judges in scoring tasks where correctness should be style-independent.

Method: Formalized seven persuasion techniques (e.g., Majority, Consistency) and embedded them into identical math responses. Tested across six benchmarks.

Result: Persuasive language inflated scores for incorrect solutions by up to 8%, with Consistency causing the worst bias. Larger models didn't help, and combining techniques increased bias.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines are vulnerable to persuasion-based attacks, requiring robust defenses.

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a compositional approach for Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in NLP, bridging a research gap by showing SA's compositional rules apply to FA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative evaluations of compositional approaches in FA, linking FA and SA due to their close relationship.

Method: Uses Universal Dependencies (UDs) formalism for syntactic rules (modification, coordination, negation) in SA, comparing with non-compositional VADER.

Result: The compositional method offers interpretability and explainability, tested for accuracy against VADER.

Conclusion: Compositional rules in SA generalize to FA, validated on appropriate datasets.

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates if top-performing LLMs can replace human expert annotators in specialized domains (finance, biomedicine, law) using individual and multi-agent approaches. Findings show limited gains from inference-time techniques and reasoning models, with multi-agent discussions revealing unique model behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs, perceived as expert-level in benchmarks, can effectively replace human expert annotators in specialized domains, addressing the high cost and labor of manual annotation.

Method: Evaluated individual LLMs and multi-agent discussion frameworks across finance, biomedicine, and law, incorporating reasoning models for comparison.

Result: Inference-time techniques and reasoning models showed marginal or negative gains; multi-agent discussions revealed behaviors like reluctance to change initial annotations.

Conclusion: LLMs have limited effectiveness as direct replacements for human expert annotators in specialized domains, with multi-agent approaches offering insights but no significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited
benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model
behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even
when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

Result: Legal-specific LLMs outperform general-purpose models, especially in nuanced legal tasks. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT achieve SOTA with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Legal-specific LLMs are superior for contract understanding, providing a foundation for more accurate systems.

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple
legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in
contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10
legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and
compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the
development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

### [354] [Large Language Models for Czech Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07860)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 19 LLMs for Czech ABSA, finding domain-specific fine-tuned models outperform general-purpose LLMs in zero/few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the unexplored capabilities of LLMs for Czech ABSA, a fine-grained sentiment analysis task.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of 19 LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios, analyzing factors like multilingualism, model size, and recency.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuned models outperform general-purpose LLMs in zero/few-shot; fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art. Error analysis reveals challenges in aspect term prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for Czech ABSA, with fine-tuning yielding best results. Insights guide future research in this area.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their
performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show
that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform
general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

### [355] [Few-shot Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Sequence-to-Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07866)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adding a few target language examples to training significantly improves cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) performance, even surpassing monolingual baselines with 1,000 examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of low-resource languages in ABSA by leveraging few-shot target language examples, avoiding reliance on external translation tools.

Method: Evaluate the impact of adding few-shot target language examples (as few as ten) across four ABSA tasks, six languages, and two sequence-to-sequence models.

Result: Few-shot examples improve performance over zero-shot settings and match constrained decoding. Combining 1,000 examples with English data outperforms monolingual baselines.

Conclusion: Few-shot target language examples are a practical and effective solution for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultureCare, a dataset for culturally sensitive emotional support, and evaluates LLM adaptation strategies, showing their potential in clinical training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources for culturally sensitive emotional support by LLMs.

Method: Developed CultureCare dataset, tested four adaptation strategies for LLMs, and evaluated using LLM judges, human annotators, and psychologists.

Result: Adapted LLMs outperformed anonymous peer responses, but cultural role-play alone was insufficient. LLMs showed promise in clinical training.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance culturally sensitive support and clinical training, though more nuanced methods are needed beyond role-play.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and
generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability
to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of
resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed
for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages,
1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional
and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four
adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally
sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges,
in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that
adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple
cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore
the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their
potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-parameter method for specifying emotional non-manual signals in signing avatars, using the EASIER notation for more coherent and nuanced expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional content in sign languages is challenging for avatars due to the lack of a standard method for specifying emotional states.

Method: A two-parameter representation is applied to the Paula signing avatar, controlled via the EASIER notation for textual input.

Result: The method shows promise for coherent and nuanced emotional expressions and consistent linguistic annotations.

Conclusion: The two-parameter approach facilitates better emotional expression in signing avatars and improves linguistic specifications.

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

*Furkan Şahinuç,Subhabrata Dutta,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework for assessing the quality of AI-generated scientific writing, specifically related work sections, by integrating expert preferences and domain-specific criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating AI-generated scientific writing, which conventional metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems fail to assess accurately due to lack of domain expertise.

Method: Proposes GREP, a framework decomposing evaluation into fine-grained dimensions, augmented with contrastive few-shot examples for contextual guidance. It offers two variants: one with proprietary LLMs and another with open-weight LLMs.

Result: GREP outperforms standard LLM judges, aligns with human expert assessments, and reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to meet validation constraints or improve based on feedback.

Conclusion: GREP provides a robust, expert-aligned evaluation method for AI-generated scientific writing, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

TL;DR: A survey on applying large language models (LLMs) to subjective language tasks, covering sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and more, while addressing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To review advances in using LLMs for subjective language tasks, given their nuanced nature and the paradigm shift brought by models like ChatGPT and LLaMA.

Method: Comprehensive review of LLM architectures and techniques, task definitions, datasets, and state-of-the-art methods for eight subjective tasks.

Result: LLMs are well-suited for modeling subtle human-like judgments, but challenges like ambiguity, bias, and ethical concerns remain.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a resource for researchers, highlighting open issues and future directions in affective computing and figurative language processing with LLMs.

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

*Matthias Sperber,Maureen de Seyssel,Jiajun Bao,Matthias Paulik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how human interpreting principles can enhance speech translation systems, aiming to bridge the usability gap and advance toward machine interpreting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech translation systems lack adaptability like human interpreters, limiting their practical usefulness. Understanding human interpreting can improve these systems.

Method: The study reviews human interpreting literature from a machine translation perspective, focusing on operational and qualitative aspects.

Result: Findings suggest potential to integrate human interpreting principles into speech translation systems using modern modeling techniques.

Conclusion: The paper inspires progress toward machine interpreting by leveraging human-like adaptability and usability.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world
situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical
usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

### [361] [Understanding Syntactic Generalization in Structure-inducing Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07969)
*David Arps,Hassan Sajjad,Laura Kallmeyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLMs) on syntactic representation, grammaticality tasks, and training dynamics, finding GPST performs most consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps and lack of comparability in evaluating SiLMs, this work systematically compares three architectures.

Method: Three SiLM architectures (Structformer, UDGN, GPST) are evaluated using English corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions.

Result: GPST performs best, especially on long-distance dependencies, but no model dominates all metrics. Small models on synthetic data are useful for evaluation.

Conclusion: GPST is the most consistent performer, and synthetic data aids in evaluating SiLM properties.

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASearcher is an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents, improving scalability, efficiency, and data quality in search intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source agents lack expert-level Search Intelligence, facing issues in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. Existing methods have limitations like small turn limits in RL training.

Method: ASearcher introduces scalable asynchronous RL training and a prompt-based LLM agent to synthesize high-quality QAs for training.

Result: The QwQ-32B agent shows significant improvements (46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on benchmarks) and handles extreme long-horizon searches (40+ turns, 150k+ tokens).

Conclusion: ASearcher outperforms existing open-source 32B agents, achieving high benchmark scores (42.1 on xBench, 52.8 on GAIA) with a simple design and no external LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Metaphors Corpus (MCC), a dataset of 792 annotated scientific metaphors in medical and biological domains, addressing a gap in domain-specific metaphor detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in domain-specific metaphor detection, as existing resources focus on general-domain text, and to enhance understanding of figurative language in scientific discourse.

Method: Creation of MCC, aggregating metaphorical expressions from diverse sources (peer-reviewed literature, news, social media, crowdsourcing) with binary and graded metaphoricity annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art language models show modest performance on scientific metaphor detection, indicating room for improvement in domain-specific figurative language understanding.

Conclusion: MCC enables various research applications, including metaphor detection benchmarking and patient-centered communication tools, advancing computational scientific metaphor research.

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WideSearch, a benchmark to evaluate LLM-powered search agents' reliability in large-scale information collection, revealing significant deficiencies in current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLM-powered search agents' reliability in wide-context information collection tasks.

Method: Developed WideSearch, a benchmark with 200 manually curated questions across diverse domains, featuring a rigorous quality control pipeline.

Result: Current search agents perform poorly (0-5% success rate), while human testers achieve near 100%, highlighting critical deficiencies.

Conclusion: Urgent research and development are needed to improve agentic search systems for large-scale information seeking.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

TL;DR: OpT-DeUS uses Optimal Transport to align and fuse Transformer blocks for efficient depth up-scaling in LLMs, outperforming existing methods in performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth up-scaling methods for LLMs often ignore neuron permutation differences, leading to misalignment and performance issues.

Method: Proposes OpT-DeUS, which aligns and fuses Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers using Optimal Transport to create new layers.

Result: OpT-DeUS achieves better performance and training efficiency than existing methods, with top-layer insertion further improving efficiency and gains.

Conclusion: OpT-DeUS effectively addresses neuron misalignment in depth up-scaling, offering a scalable and efficient solution for LLM training.

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

### [367] [Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08095)
*Chun Wang,Chenyang Liu,Wenze Xu,Weihong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve speech-language models (SLMs) by disentangling paralinguistic and linguistic information using heterogeneous adapters and a weakly supervised training strategy, achieving competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational systems using text-based LLMs ignore paralinguistic cues, while SLMs built on frozen LLMs fail to capture these cues and lose contextual understanding.

Method: The authors introduce two heterogeneous adapters and a weakly supervised training strategy to disentangle paralinguistic and linguistic information, avoiding task-specific vectors.

Result: The approach shows competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, effectively integrating paralinguistic and linguistic information.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances SLMs by preserving contextual understanding and efficiently capturing paralinguistic cues, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks LLM-generated text detectors in education, introduces the GEDE dataset, and shows detectors struggle with intermediate student contribution levels, often producing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in academic integrity due to LLM-generated texts and ensure fair detection methods in education.

Method: Benchmarks state-of-the-art detectors using the GEDE dataset, which includes human-written and LLM-generated essays, and introduces contribution levels to categorize text origins.

Result: Most detectors fail to accurately classify intermediate contribution levels (e.g., LLM-improved texts) and frequently produce false positives.

Conclusion: Current detectors are unreliable for educational use, especially for nuanced cases, highlighting the need for improved methods to avoid unfair impacts on students.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased
accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'

### [369] [Iterative refinement, not training objective, makes HuBERT behave differently from wav2vec 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08110)
*Robin Huo,Ewan Dunbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, focusing on how training iteration (not objective) affects linguistic information encoding in self-supervised speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model architecture influences linguistic information in self-supervised speech representations.

Method: Comparison of HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, analyzing training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Training iteration, not objective, explains differences in hidden representations' correlation to word, phoneme, and speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future work should explore why iterative refinement effectively encodes linguistic information in self-supervised speech models.

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

### [370] [Czech Dataset for Complex Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08125)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Ondřej Pražák,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is introduced, featuring 3.1K annotated restaurant reviews and 24M unannotated reviews. It supports advanced tasks like target-aspect-category detection and aligns with SemEval-2016 format for cross-lingual use. High inter-annotator agreement (90%) and baseline results with Transformer models are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a Czech dataset supporting complex ABSA tasks and enable cross-lingual comparisons by aligning with SemEval-2016 standards.

Method: The dataset includes 3.1K manually annotated restaurant reviews and 24M unannotated reviews. It uses a unified annotation format for advanced tasks and follows SemEval-2016. Two annotators achieved 90% agreement.

Result: The dataset supports advanced ABSA tasks and cross-lingual evaluation. Baseline results with Transformer models are provided, along with error analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a gap for Czech ABSA research, offering annotated and unannotated data, robust baselines, and cross-lingual compatibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely
available for non-commercial research purposes.

### [371] [Optimal Transport Regularization for Speech Text Alignment in Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08131)
*Wenze Xu,Chun Wang,Jiazhen Yu,Sheng Chen,Liang Gao,Weihong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTReg, a method using optimal transport to align speech and text embeddings, improves SLM generalization by mitigating the modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs struggle to generalize across datasets due to the modality gap between speech and text representations, hindering their intended text-like processing.

Method: OTReg formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem, deriving a regularization loss to optimize SLM training without extra labels or parameters.

Result: OTReg enhances speech-text alignment, reduces the modality gap, and improves SLM generalization in multilingual ASR experiments.

Conclusion: OTReg effectively addresses the modality gap, improving SLM performance and generalization without added complexity.

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

### [372] [Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08139)
*Tianyi Zhou,Johanne Medina,Sanjay Chawla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how in-context information affects LLM behavior and proposes a method using token-level uncertainty to predict response reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect but fluent content (confabulation), posing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications. The study aims to understand how context influences reliability and whether LLMs can self-identify unreliable outputs.

Method: The method computes aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens. It aggregates their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction.

Result: Experiments show correct context improves accuracy and confidence, while misleading context leads to confidently incorrect responses. The proposed method improves unreliable output detection across LLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations of direct uncertainty signals and advocates for uncertainty-guided probing to enhance reliability-aware generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

*Jun Wang,Zaifu Zhan,Qixin Zhang,Mingquan Lin,Meijia Song,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dual-Div, a framework for diversity-enhanced demonstration selection in biomedical NLP tasks, outperforms baselines by optimizing representativeness and diversity in example selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for in-context learning (ICL) in biomedical NLP prioritize representativeness over diversity in example selection, limiting performance.

Method: Dual-Div uses a two-stage retrieval and ranking process to select diverse and representative examples for ICL, evaluated on three biomedical tasks with LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5.

Result: Dual-Div achieves up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores, showing robustness to prompt changes and class imbalance.

Conclusion: Diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than ranking-stage optimization, and 3-5 demonstrations maximize efficiency.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

*Wentao Jiang,Xiang Feng,Zengmao Wang,Yong Luo,Pingbo Xu,Zhe Chen,Bo Du,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REX-RAG integrates RL with RAG to improve LLM reasoning by escaping unproductive paths and correcting policy biases, achieving performance gains on QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of LLMs getting stuck in unproductive reasoning paths (dead ends) during policy-driven trajectory sampling, which hampers exploration and policy optimization.

Method: Proposes REX-RAG with Mixed Sampling Strategy (probe sampling + exploratory prompts) and Policy Correction Mechanism (importance sampling to correct distribution shifts).

Result: Achieves average gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B over baselines across seven QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: REX-RAG effectively mitigates dead ends and policy biases, enhancing LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

Motivation: To model annotator disagreement more effectively in human-annotated data, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Extends DisCo by adding annotator metadata, improving input representations, and adjusting loss functions to better capture disagreement patterns.

Result: Substantial improvements in soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets, with detailed error and calibration analyses.

Conclusion: Disagreement-aware modeling is valuable, and system components interact with data complexity, offering insights for future work.

Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task is to model
annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and
perspectivist evaluation, modeling annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution
from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and
annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and
improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator
metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to
capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated
data.

TL;DR: The paper details optimizations for EAGLE-based speculative decoding in Llama models, achieving state-of-the-art inference latency and speed-ups for large batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address engineering challenges in scaling speculative decoding for production environments, particularly for Llama models.

Method: Implemented training and inference optimization techniques, including efficient GPU operations like tree attention and multi-round speculative decoding.

Result: Achieved 4 ms per token latency (10% faster than prior methods) and 1.4x-2.0x speed-up for large batch sizes.

Conclusion: The optimizations enable efficient, scalable speculative decoding for Llama models in production.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates inference-time uncertainty measures in large language models (LLMs) to assess their alignment with human uncertainty and traditional calibration, finding strong alignment in some metrics despite mismatches with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM-user interaction by ensuring model uncertainty aligns with human uncertainty, enhancing trust and control.

Method: Evaluates various inference-time uncertainty measures using established and novel metrics, comparing them to human group-level uncertainty and traditional calibration.

Result: Some uncertainty measures strongly align with human uncertainty, showing moderate to strong calibration in correctness and distributional analysis.

Conclusion: Certain inference-time uncertainty metrics effectively align with human uncertainty, offering potential for better model control and user trust.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAEMark is a post-hoc multi-bit watermarking framework for LLM-generated text, embedding messages via inference-time rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. It preserves text quality and works across languages and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods degrade text quality, require white-box access, and exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. SAEMark addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses feature-based rejection sampling on deterministic features extracted from text, aligning feature statistics with key-derived targets. Works without logit manipulation or training.

Result: Achieves 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy across 4 datasets, preserving text quality.

Conclusion: SAEMark offers a scalable, out-of-the-box solution for watermarking closed-source LLMs, enabling content attribution without compromising quality.

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

TL;DR: GPT-5 outperforms baselines in medical QA tasks, achieving above human-expert performance in multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-5's zero-shot reasoning in medical decision-making, integrating text and visual data.

Method: Benchmarked GPT-5 variants on MedQA, MedXpertQA, MMLU, USMLE, and VQA-RAD using standardized protocols.

Result: GPT-5 surpasses GPT-4o and human experts, with significant gains in reasoning and understanding.

Conclusion: GPT-5's performance suggests potential for advanced clinical decision-support systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Motivation: The challenge of evaluating LLM safety alignment in ethically sensitive mental health dialogues due to missing gold-standard answers.

Method: Prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach with expert-defined reasoning chains and binary point-wise scoring across safety dimensions.

Result: Achieves highest agreement with expert assessments and produces interpretable evaluation rationales.

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench and its dataset are publicly available to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures and studying safety issues in language models, as current helpful-only models are not publicly available.

Method: Develop Jinx, a variant of open-weight LLMs, to respond to all queries without refusals or safety filtering while retaining reasoning and instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: Jinx fills a gap by offering a publicly available helpful-only model for alignment and safety research.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx

*Atahan Karagoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric theory of survival, rejecting traditional supervised learning. Survival emerges from biological state space curvature and flow, modeled via Self-Organizing Survival Manifolds (SOSM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reframe survival as a geometric property of biological state space rather than a supervised task reliant on labels.

Method: Develops SOSM theory, introducing a survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization, with discrete and continuous formulations.

Result: Demonstrates emergence of survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions, linking survival to geometric flow stability.

Conclusion: Survival is a geometric phase transition in manifold structure, offering a universal, label-free foundation bridging ML, biophysics, and geometry.

Abstract: Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on
curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It
proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric
consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in
biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival
Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature
geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A
survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is
introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric
flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective
and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of
survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The
framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci
curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.
Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions
in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free
foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging
machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-phase learning framework combining Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection and self-training SVM for semi-supervised refinement improves supply chain fraud detection, achieving an F1-score of 0.817.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraud detection in supply chains is challenging due to complexity, class imbalance, and limited labeled data. Traditional methods struggle under these conditions.

Method: Proposes a two-phase approach: (1) Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection, (2) self-training SVM using labeled and pseudo-labeled data for refinement.

Result: Achieves an F1-score of 0.817 and a false positive rate below 3.0% on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for supply chain fraud detection but has limitations like concept drift and lacks comparison with deep learning methods.

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the
complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional
detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision,
reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first
phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection
to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring
further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence
pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed
method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive
real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score
of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised
pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection
under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding
concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Method: Combines Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) and Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples for underrepresented interaction classes.

Result: The approach improves predictive performance across all interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses class imbalance in DDI prediction, enhancing model performance for rare interactions.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness
of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but
critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as
a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward
frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)
to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and
generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

*A. Quadir,M. Tanveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGMN, a novel hypergraph neural network with state space model, integrates role-aware representations into GNNs, improving node classification by combining role-based and adjacency-based features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs overlook role-based characteristics, limiting expressive node representations. Existing role-based methods are unsupervised and underperform in downstream tasks.

Method: HGMN uses hypergraph construction (node degree and neighborhood levels) and a mamba transformer to combine role-based and adjacency-based representations. It includes hypergraph convolution layers and a residual network to prevent over-smoothing.

Result: HGMN outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs on node classification tasks across multiple datasets, demonstrating enriched node representations.

Conclusion: HGMN effectively integrates role-based features with adjacency information, offering a versatile and powerful solution for graph-based learning.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant
attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,
traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,
often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for
learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing
role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal
performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively
integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN
utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships
and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable
mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction
methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the
connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's
representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution
layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph
structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we
incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature
propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly
introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of
HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node
classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results
highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by
effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,
making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning
applications.

*Zian Zhai,Fan Li,Xingyu Tan,Xiaoyang Wang,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGVQ, a framework to address codebook collapse in graph VQ by using graph topology and feature similarity as regularization, improving token diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Codebook collapse in graph VQ limits expressiveness and generalization, yet remains underexplored. The study aims to understand and mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes RGVQ, integrating graph topology and feature similarity as regularization, using Gumbel-Softmax for soft assignments and structure-aware contrastive regularization.

Result: RGVQ enhances codebook utilization and boosts performance of graph VQ backbones in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RGVQ effectively mitigates codebook collapse, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for
learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a
fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the
graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of
graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that
codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with
mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why
graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical
analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by
redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing
optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose
RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity
as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote
token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In
addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to
penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization
and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones
across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable
graph token representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning framework for neuroimaging CAD systems improves diagnostic accuracy by addressing subtype heterogeneity and data variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome low reproducibility in small-sample studies and confounding heterogeneity in large-scale datasets for neuroimaging CAD systems.

Method: Proposes a federated learning framework with a dynamic navigation module for routing samples and a meta-integration module for unified predictions.

Result: Achieved 74.06% average accuracy across multiple cohorts, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reliability and reproducibility in neuroimaging CAD, benefiting personalized medicine and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing
neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However,
small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale
datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes
being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our
approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most
suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a
meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local
models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a
comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100
healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness
compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an
average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its
effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model
generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the
dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By
addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances
reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant
potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology
and psychiatry.

TL;DR: A framework integrating generative AI with multi-disciplinary literature (plant science, biomimetics, materials engineering) to design bioinspired materials, validated by real-world fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited application of LLMs in discipline-specific experimental science, especially in multi-disciplinary fields like materials science, by leveraging AI for innovative materials design.

Method: Combines fine-tuned BioinspiredLLM, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and Hierarchical Sampling to extract structure-property relationships and generate hypotheses for bioinspired materials.

Result: Successfully fabricated a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, validating the AI-generated designs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates AI-assisted ideation's potential for real-world materials design and effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores filtering dual-use topics from training data to enhance tamper-resistance in open-weight AI systems, showing improved resistance to adversarial attacks without degrading unrelated capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight AI systems are vulnerable to tampering attacks, and existing safety methods are insufficient. The study aims to assess if data filtering can serve as a robust safeguard.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering is introduced, and 6.9B-parameter models are pretrained to test resistance to adversarial fine-tuning.

Result: Filtered models resist adversarial attacks (up to 10,000 steps) and outperform baselines, but can still leverage dangerous knowledge when provided in context.

Conclusion: Pretraining data curation is a promising defense layer for open-weight AI, though a defense-in-depth approach is needed.

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced
transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are
vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors
by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust
science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning
methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs
resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this
paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from
training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more
tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable
data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for
minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple
6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial
resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M
tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training
baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to
unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized
dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when
it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a
need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish
pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI
systems.

### [390] [Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06614)
*Fangjun Hu,Guangkuo Liu,Yifan Zhang,Xun Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new perspective on data distribution phases in diffusion models, proposing local denoisers for efficiency and diagnosing phase transitions with an information-theoretic bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-life data (e.g., images) has low-dimensional spatial structure, but standard diffusion models ignore this, leading to computationally expensive global score functions.

Method: Defines data distribution phases based on local operations, identifies trivial and data phases in denoising, and uses conditional mutual information to bound local denoiser fidelity.

Result: Local neural networks suffice for score functions outside phase transitions; global networks are only needed near transitions.

Conclusion: Simpler, more efficient diffusion model architectures are possible, leveraging local denoisers and physics-inspired design principles.

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by
statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in
synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process
gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often
spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion
models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,
which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new
perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into
constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two
distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be
mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.
Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial
phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local
denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an
information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on
conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a
real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures
of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small
local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are
only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This
result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,
the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the
design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

TL;DR: Proposes a generalized scaling law for large language models, unifying dense and sparse architectures, and evaluates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of predicting model size and resource allocation efficiently, as current scaling laws are architecture-specific.

Method: Revisits existing scaling laws and introduces a generalized framework applicable to both dense and sparse models.

Result: Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scaling law through evaluation and comparison with existing laws.

Conclusion: The generalized scaling law provides a unified solution for optimizing large language model training across architectures.

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially,
as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth
has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally
predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge.
Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling
laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In
this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling
law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse
large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with
existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: ANTIDOTE is a novel objective for learning under noisy labels, using adversarial training to reduce noise impact, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning from datasets with inherent or adversarial label noise.

Method: Defines objectives via relaxation over an information-divergence neighborhood, reformulated as adversarial training with computational efficiency.

Result: Effectively reduces noisy label influence, analogous to forgetting noisy samples, and outperforms leading methods.

Conclusion: ANTIDOTE is a practical, efficient solution for noisy label scenarios, with performance close to standard cross-entropy loss.

Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy
labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an
information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a
reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational
cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach
adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during
learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples.
ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent
in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels.
Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric,
human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms
leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is
very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

TL;DR: A multimodal approach using electronic health records improves early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) up to one year before clinical diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of PDAC is challenging due to lack of symptoms and reliable biomarkers. This work aims to leverage EHR data for improved detection.

Method: Combines neural controlled differential equations for lab time series, pretrained language models for diagnosis codes, and cross-attention for modality interactions.

Result: Achieves 6.5% to 15.5% AUC improvement over existing methods and identifies new biomarkers.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach significantly enhances early PDAC detection and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and
early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of
specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new
multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and
routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to
detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines
neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series,
pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code
trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture
interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach
on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels
associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new
biomarkers. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating synthetic data from large language models with real data for valid statistical conclusions.

Method: Introduces a hyperparameter-free estimator based on generalized method of moments, leveraging interactions between synthetic and real data residuals.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved finite-sample performance in computational social science regression tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator effectively combines synthetic and real data, enhancing parameter estimates with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being
explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research
in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the
potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled
manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate
entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as
in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means
practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce
statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new
estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a
hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the
challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment
residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the
target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our
estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science
applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

TL;DR: Two adaptive thresholding frameworks, SCS and MACS, are introduced for anomaly detection in nonstationary time series, outperforming traditional methods in F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of static thresholds in nonstationary environments with shifting statistical properties.

Method: Leverage statistical online learning and segmentation for adaptive thresholds (SCS and MACS).

Result: Significant F1-score improvement on Wafer Manufacturing datasets compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely anomaly detection in evolving distributions.

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as
manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt
to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.
Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,
concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we
introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:
Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence
Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation
principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees
on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across
Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement
compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work
demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable
reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

TL;DR: The paper explores Universal Sequence Maps (USM) for bijective encoding of symbolic sequences, resolving seeding biases and revealing USM's efficient convergence to steady-state embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for encoding mechanisms that retain contextual information in symbolic sequences for modeling by neural networks, leveraging Language Models and Transformers.

Method: USM uses two Chaos Game Representations (CGR) iterated forward and backward, projected into the frequency domain (FCGR), enabling Chebyshev distance and k-mer frequency computations.

Result: Resolved seeding biases, achieving full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity and uncovering USM's efficient convergence to steady-state embeddings. Demonstrated with genomic sequences but applicable to any alphabet.

Conclusion: USM provides a robust and efficient method for bijective sequence encoding, with potential applications across diverse symbolic sequences.

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

TL;DR: CORAL introduces a two-agent framework (IA and CA) for in-context RL, using emergent communication to improve generalization and adaptation in unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents often overfit to training environments, limiting their ability to generalize. CORAL aims to address this by decoupling representation learning from control.

Method: CORAL uses an Information Agent (IA) to learn a world model and distill it into messages, shaped by a Causal Influence Loss. A Control Agent (CA) then interprets these messages to solve tasks.

Result: Experiments show CORAL improves sample efficiency and enables zero-shot adaptation in unseen sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: Learning transferable communicative representations via CORAL effectively enhances RL agents' generalization and adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks
and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned
representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training
environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work
formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces
CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a
transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning
from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world
model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task
reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise
messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal
Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next
action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed
contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by
interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample
efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of
pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the
efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Motivation: To address the scalability and efficiency limitations of GNNs by leveraging the strong nonlinear expressiveness of KANs.

Method: Integrates KANs into GAT, SGC, and APPNP, creating KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP, and employs multi-teacher knowledge amalgamation for a graph-independent KAN student model.

Result: Proposed models improve node classification accuracy, and knowledge amalgamation boosts student model performance.

Conclusion: KANs enhance GNN expressiveness and enable efficient, graph-free inference.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on
graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits
scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent
architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear
expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into
three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new
models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge
amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is
distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy,
and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model
performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN
expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Motivation: The increasing deployment of advanced models like KAN in critical domains necessitates robust intellectual property protection, which existing watermarking methods fail to provide for KAN.

Method: DCT-AW embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs in KAN using discrete cosine transform, ensuring task independence.

Result: DCT-AW minimally impacts model performance and shows superior robustness against attacks like fine-tuning, pruning, and retraining.

Conclusion: DCT-AW is an effective and robust watermarking solution tailored for KAN, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine
learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As
advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network
analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical.
While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for
conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel
architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable
activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex
relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also
introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel
watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking
(DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of
KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using
discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and
achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a
small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against
various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and
retraining after pruning.

### [401] [Stabilizing Federated Learning under Extreme Heterogeneity with HeteRo-Select](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06692)
*Md. Akmol Masud,Md Abrar Jahin,Mahmud Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeteRo-Select improves FL stability and accuracy by smart client selection, outperforming Oort in peak/final accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL suffers from instability due to diverse client data; existing methods like Oort struggle with accuracy drops in later stages.

Method: HeteRo-Select uses a scoring system for client selection based on usefulness, fairness, update speed, and data variety, with theoretical guarantees.

Result: HeteRo-Select achieves 74.75% peak and 72.76% final accuracy with a 1.99% stability drop, outperforming Oort (73.98%, 71.25%, 2.73%).

Conclusion: HeteRo-Select is a reliable solution for heterogeneous FL, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers
from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although
utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by
prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in
accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical
HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure
long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that
when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart
subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively
compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,
step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update
speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong
regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under
significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The
HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak
accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select
achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a
minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak
accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability
drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our
study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL
problems.

*Hager Radi Abdelwahed,Mélisande Teng,Robin Zbinden,Laura Pollock,Hugo Larochelle,Devis Tuia,David Rolnick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CISO is a deep learning-based method for species distribution modeling that incorporates incomplete biotic data alongside environmental variables, improving predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Species distribution models often overlook biotic interactions due to sparse and inconsistent co-occurrence data. CISO addresses this by accommodating incomplete species observations.

Method: CISO uses deep learning to condition predictions on a flexible number of species observations and environmental variables, tested on plant, bird, and butterfly datasets.

Result: CISO outperforms alternatives by improving predictions when conditioned on partial biotic data and combining observations from multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CISO is a promising tool for ecological research, enhancing species distribution models by integrating incomplete biotic information and identifying cross-taxa interactions.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species'
geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and
conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to
environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,
precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also
strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often
overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by
incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise
relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In
practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information
about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across
locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based
method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species
Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number
of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the
variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our
approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen
for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for
butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information
improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When
conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms
alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.
Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can
improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of
incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential
interactions between species from disparate taxa.

### [403] [Analysis of Schedule-Free Nonconvex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06743)
*Connor Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust Lyapunov framework for analyzing the Schedule-Free (SF) method in nonconvex optimization, providing horizon-agnostic convergence rates under minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical first-order methods require step-sizes dependent on the total horizon, which is often unknown. The SF method avoids this but lacks comprehensive nonconvex analysis.

Method: A Lyapunov framework is developed to analyze SF under L-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reducing analysis to a single-step descent inequality.

Result: Horizon-agnostic bounds are derived: O(1/log T), O(log T/T), and O(T^{-(1-α)}). Numerical experiments suggest potential tightening of rates.

Conclusion: The work extends SF's guarantees to nonconvex settings and explores future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their
classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that
depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The
Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters
that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging
and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on
strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under
only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step
descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex
setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a
linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for
polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation
Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that
our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to
$O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex
optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed MobiLLM enables efficient federated fine-tuning of LLMs on mobile devices by reducing computational and communication overhead, using a server-assisted side-tuning paradigm and adaptive feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of computational/memory burdens and synchronization delays in federated LLM fine-tuning on heterogeneous mobile devices.

Method: Proposes Fed MobiLLM: a server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm where mobile devices perform lightweight forward propagation and upload activations, while the server trains a shared side-network asynchronously. Adaptive layer-wise feature alignment bridges model heterogeneity.

Result: Achieves 95.2% reduction in computation, 93.2% reduction in communication costs, and 5.1x faster convergence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Fed MobiLLM is effective for practical LLM adaptation on diverse mobile devices, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over
heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of
personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system
challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive
computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous
model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose
Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across
mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model
architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering
server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform
lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen
pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.
The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side
backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model
heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise
feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for
collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while
achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in
computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster
convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical
LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP) detects model drift using null directions of transformer activations without task labels, offering theoretical guarantees and a practical metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect model drift without relying on task labels or output evaluations, leveraging null directions of transformer activations.

Method: Proposes ZDP, a theory-only framework, with proofs under assumptions A1-A6, including the Variance-Leak Theorem and Fisher Null-Conservation. Introduces the Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric.

Result: Derives theoretical guarantees (e.g., Rank-Leak bound, logarithmic-regret for online trackers) and non-asymptotic tail bounds for drift detection.

Conclusion: Monitoring null spaces of layer activations and Fisher geometry provides testable guarantees for detecting representational change.

Abstract: We present Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a theory-only framework for
detecting model drift from null directions of transformer activations without
task labels or output evaluations. Under assumptions A1--A6, we prove: (i) the
Variance--Leak Theorem, (ii) Fisher Null-Conservation, (iii) a Rank--Leak bound
for low-rank updates, and (iv) a logarithmic-regret guarantee for online
null-space trackers. We derive a Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric with
non-asymptotic tail bounds and a concentration inequality, yielding a-priori
thresholds for drift under a Gaussian null model. These results show that
monitoring right/left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher
geometry provides concrete, testable guarantees on representational change.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PROPS is a privacy-preserving alignment framework for LLMs, offering better utility than DP-SGD and RR while maintaining high privacy for human preference labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in LLM alignment by ensuring human preference labels do not reveal personal values or traits.

Method: PROPS uses multi-stage alignment with privately aligned models as labelers for subsequent stages.

Result: PROPS achieves up to 3x higher win-rates than DP-SGD and 2.5x higher than RR for the same privacy budget.

Conclusion: PROPS effectively balances privacy and utility in LLM alignment, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using
human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms.
Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's
preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality
traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD),
provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning
and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences
are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model
utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy,
which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose
PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving
alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve
as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of
alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive
validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval,
Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over
existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy
budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to
DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based
alignment.

*Junjing Zheng,Chengliang Song,Weidong Jiang,Xinyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MA-NTAE introduces a non-linear Tucker autoencoder for high-order tensor data, improving computational efficiency and feature learning over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional tensor data challenges self-supervised learning due to computational inefficiency and limited non-linear feature capture in existing methods.

Method: MA-NTAE generalizes Tucker decomposition to a non-linear framework using a Pick-and-Unfold strategy for flexible per-mode encoding.

Result: MA-NTAE shows linear computational complexity growth with tensor order and outperforms standard AE and tensor networks in compression and clustering.

Conclusion: MA-NTAE effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering scalable and efficient learning for high-order tensors.

Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors,
presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based
autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening
operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively
large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization
for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks
alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most
exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder
(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear
framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible
per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold
operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE
exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and
proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks
in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for
higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

*Rui Liu,Haolin Zuo,Zheng Lian,Hongyu Yuan,Qi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HARDY-MER is a framework for multimodal emotion recognition that dynamically adjusts training focus on hard samples by evaluating reconstruction difficulty and cross-modal mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of conventional missing modality reconstruction methods, which fail to account for varying reconstruction difficulty across samples.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: Multi-view Hardness Evaluation (quantifying Direct and Indirect Hardness) and Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning (adjusting training focus).

Result: Outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HARDY-MER effectively enhances model performance on hard samples in MER by dynamically adapting the training curriculum.

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in
multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address
this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail
to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different
samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples
effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware
Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates
in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and
second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance
model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first
introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies
reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality
reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information).
Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with
similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and
hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG) for offline-to-online RL, improving data augmentation by reducing the gap between offline and online data distributions without extra classifier training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for offline-to-online RL struggle with data distribution gaps, limiting performance. CFDG aims to enhance generation quality and alignment with online data.

Method: CFDG uses classifier-free guidance diffusion for high-quality data generation and a reweighting method to align generated data with online distributions.

Result: CFDG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 15% average improvement on D4RL benchmarks like MuJoCo and AntMaze.

Conclusion: CFDG is a versatile and effective data augmentation approach for offline-to-online RL, compatible with existing algorithms.

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online
fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online
interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform
to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data
still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To
address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free
Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training
overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly
enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different
distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more
generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while
maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG
outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to
generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing
offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,
PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical
performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

TL;DR: The paper presents an open-source approach to adapt LLMs for the niche Q programming language, achieving superior performance over frontier models like Claude Opus-4 and GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized tasks, especially in niche languages like Q, are under-represented online, making general-purpose LLMs ineffective. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: The approach involves pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning on Qwen-2.5 models (1.5B to 32B parameters), evaluated using a new Leetcode-style Q dataset.

Result: The best model achieves 59% pass@1 accuracy, outperforming Claude Opus-4 by 29.5% and GPT-4.1. All models, even the smallest (1.5B), surpass GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective for niche languages and can be extended to other tasks with subjective evaluation criteria. Models, code, and data are released openly.

Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is
still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented
on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in
niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and
largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a
comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming
language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on
the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and
is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new
Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the
dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement
learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the
Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our
best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark,
surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent.
Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task.
In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed
blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning,
and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we
discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those
where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks due to minimal prior knowledge and adversarial obfuscation.

Method: An adversarial game between red and blue teams, using CNNs and testing strategies like Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, and adversarial attacks.

Result: High accuracy (100%) for adversarial-attack-based methods with hints; varied performance for other techniques. LLM auditing requires hints about undesired distributions.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to better audit designs, with open-sourced auditing games and models.

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge
due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We
explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two
teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign
data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the
performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The
blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to
identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue
team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated
gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by
the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods
(100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the
other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds,
we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our
study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require
some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard
black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their
misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and
hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

TL;DR: The paper explores how sparsification methods (GMP and SET) mitigate plasticity loss in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), improving performance by addressing neuron dormancy and representational collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning hinders adaptability, especially in MTRL where diverse task demands require higher representational flexibility.

Method: The study evaluates GMP and SET across MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) and benchmarks, comparing them to dense baselines and other plasticity methods.

Result: GMP and SET effectively reduce plasticity degradation indicators (e.g., neuron dormancy) and often enhance multi-task performance, outperforming dense models and competing with explicit plasticity interventions.

Conclusion: Dynamic sparsification is a robust, context-sensitive tool for improving plasticity and adaptability in MTRL systems.

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a
critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in
multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational
flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task
demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly
Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance
plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate
these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture
of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks,
comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative
plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that
both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation,
such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity
improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse
agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive
results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights
into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs,
highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for
developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore conformal prediction's role in trustworthy AI beyond its validity, addressing broader challenges like generalization and governance.

Method: The article reviews conformal prediction's applications, supported by experiments and examples for calibration and bias mitigation.

Result: Conformal prediction is shown to enhance trustworthy AI through reliable uncertainty quantification and bias handling.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction is a valuable tool for trustworthy AI, offering well-calibrated predictions and addressing critical issues like bias and governance.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's
by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with
guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity
and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the
machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that
they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty
quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy
AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both
the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the
potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its
marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and
AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its

*Shichao Ma,Zhengyang Zhou,Qihe Huang,Binwu Wang,Kuo Yang,Huan Li,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuiZSF integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) to enhance zero-shot forecasting, achieving top performance in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with zero-shot forecasting (ZSF) in data-scarce scenarios, and existing TSPMs lack dynamic external knowledge integration.

Method: Proposes QuiZSF, a framework with ChronoRAG Base (CRB) for scalable storage/retrieval, Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) for feature extraction, and Model Cooperation Coherer (MCC) for aligning retrieved knowledge with TSPMs.

Result: QuiZSF ranks Top1 in 75% (Non-LLM TSPMs) and 87.5% (LLM-based TSPMs) of prediction settings, with high efficiency.

Conclusion: QuiZSF effectively combines RAG and TSPMs, advancing zero-shot time series forecasting with superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse
applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),
particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or
forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to
deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated
strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically
incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on
demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of
both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series
forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series
Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient
retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.
Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)
for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a
Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and
coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation
Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM
based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM
based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and
87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and
inference time.

*Lishi Zuo,Man-Wai Mak,Lu Yi,Youzhi Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses class-feature bias in medical diagnosis models, proposing a class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) with a class-wise inequality loss and group distributionally robust optimization to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate bias in medical diagnosis models caused by class-feature bias and class imbalance, which leads to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes a class-wise inequality loss and class-weighted training objective (group distributionally robust optimization) to balance contributions from positive and negative classes and upweight underperforming classes.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method effectively reduces class-feature bias and class imbalance, improving model generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed Cls-unbias model successfully mitigates bias and imbalance, enhancing diagnostic model performance and generalization.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified
class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that
are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased
performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a
class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and
class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise
inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from
positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise
group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training
objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness
of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world
datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively
impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both
class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's
generalization ability.

*Lixuan He,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

TL;DR: AMFT introduces a single-stage algorithm to balance SFT and RL dynamically using meta-gradient adaptive weights, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the suboptimal trade-offs and catastrophic forgetting in the traditional two-stage SFT-RL pipeline for LLM fine-tuning.

Method: AMFT uses a meta-gradient adaptive weight controller to dynamically balance SFT's path-level rewards and RL's outcome-based rewards, optimizing long-term performance.

Result: AMFT achieves superior performance and generalization on benchmarks like mathematical reasoning and vision-language navigation, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: AMFT provides a principled, stable, and effective paradigm for LLM alignment, validated by ablation studies and open-sourced code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit
rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

### [418] [BoRA: Towards More Expressive Low-Rank Adaptation with Block Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06953)
*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BoRA improves LoRA by using block matrix multiplication and diagonal matrices to enhance rank efficiency with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's performance improves with higher rank but increases parameters; BoRA aims to enhance rank without excessive parameter growth.

Method: BoRA partitions LoRA matrices into blocks, introduces diagonal matrices for diversity, and concatenates block products to increase rank.

Result: BoRA outperforms LoRA, increasing rank by a factor of b with minimal additional parameters, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: BoRA is a scalable, efficient alternative to LoRA, balancing performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a
pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two
low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and
$B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$
can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves
fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of
trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank
Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number
of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block
matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along
the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and
$B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the
concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the
diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix
$\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication,
resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal
matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only
requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies
further validate its scalability.

*Hiba Najjar,Bushra Alshbib,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multitask learning with satellite data modalities as additional targets to improve interpretability and performance, avoiding data scarcity issues and enabling error explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between complexity and interpretability in multimodal learning networks for remote sensing.

Method: Leverages modalities as additional targets in multitask learning, using satellite data's rich information.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than multimodal baselines, avoids data scarcity issues, and explains main task errors via auxiliary tasks.

Conclusion: Multitask learning with modalities as targets enhances interpretability and performance in remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The
usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model
performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense
of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be
leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior.
In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as
additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of
this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which
remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides
numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do
not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model
performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in
some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can
be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation,
classification, and regression tasks. Code available at

TL;DR: A framework for real-time digital twins using reduced finite element models with conditional attention mechanisms, ensuring numerical stability and exact conservation laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, accurate digital twins with sparse data while preserving numerical well-posedness and conserved quantities.

Method: Uses conditional attention mechanisms within finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to learn reduced bases and nonlinear conservation laws.

Result: Achieves accurate predictions on complex geometries with sparse data, real-time inference (~0.1s), and significant speedup (3.1x10^8) over LES.

Conclusion: The framework supports real-time calibration and closed-loop inference, integrating seamlessly with conventional finite element methods.

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on
structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent
variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a
reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the
framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical
well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of
data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports
real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of
digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor
data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a
non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration
of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics,
and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate
predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations),
including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time
inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source
implementation is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery design validation is slow and costly, hindering innovation. Existing methods rely on labeled data and prototyping, which are inefficient.

Method: DL combines active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning to predict battery lifetimes without additional data labeling, using historical designs.

Result: DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting cycle life, saving 98% time and 95% energy compared to industrial practices.

Conclusion: DL accelerates battery development by leveraging historical data, showcasing the potential of machine learning for scientific and engineering innovation.

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMove is a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing challenges of universal spatial representations and heterogeneous mobility patterns. It improves accuracy by 10.2% through joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility prediction is crucial for urban planning and services, but existing models struggle with randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and city-specific heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes a dual-tower architecture (trajectory-location) with MoE Transformer blocks for adaptive pattern handling.

Result: UniMove improves prediction accuracy by 10.2% across diverse city datasets.

Conclusion: UniMove advances foundational models for human mobility with a unified architecture.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation
optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness,
non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded
by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and
population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing
solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct
spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose
UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing
two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for
effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility
patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location
dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding
and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE
Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement
patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities
demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By
enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it
significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove
represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a
unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at

TL;DR: The paper evaluates feature selection (FS) techniques for Tsetlin machines (TMs), including classical methods, post-hoc explanations, and novel TM-specific scorers, showing competitive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is vital for model interpretability and accuracy, but TMs lack established tools for feature importance estimation. This study aims to fill that gap.

Method: Adapts and evaluates FS techniques for TMs, including filter/embedded methods, SHAP/LIME, and novel TM-specific scorers. Benchmarked on 12 datasets using ROAR and ROAD protocols.

Result: TM-internal scorers perform competitively, revealing feature interactions. Simpler TM-specific scorers retain accuracy with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Establishes the first FS baseline for TMs and encourages specialized interpretability techniques for TMs.

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability,
reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently
introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but
lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we
adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter
and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally
developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of
embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA)
states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation
protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias
(ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not
only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to
reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve
similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study
establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for
developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a greedy algorithm for selecting subsets of human experts in a decision support system, improving classification performance by leveraging conformal prediction sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on single-expert scenarios, but multiple experts can enhance performance if selected appropriately for each instance.

Method: A greedy algorithm uses conformal sets to identify relevant subsets of expert predictions for classifying instances.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal subsets, improving classification performance on CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets.

Conclusion: Selecting instance-specific subsets of experts using conformal sets outperforms naive methods, enhancing human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in
classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a
pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced
classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert
independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific
experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing
research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the
conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.
With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,
we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm
that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that
will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better
performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real
expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation
study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal
subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple
experts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TLCCSP, a framework for time series forecasting that leverages time-lagged cross-correlations using SSDTW and a contrastive learning encoder, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models often ignore time-lagged cross-correlations, which are vital for capturing complex temporal relationships in forecasting tasks.

Method: Proposes TLCCSP with SSDTW for lagged correlation capture and a contrastive learning encoder to approximate SSDTW distances efficiently.

Result: Significant MSE reductions: 16.01% (weather), 9.95% (finance), 21.29% (real estate) with SSDTW; CLE further reduces MSE by 17.88%, 6.13%, and 8.62%, respectively. CLE also cuts SSDTW computation time by ~99%.

Conclusion: TLCCSP effectively integrates lagged correlations, enhancing forecasting accuracy and scalability for real-time applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather,
finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed
decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have
improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged
cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing
complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged
Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances
forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated
sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW)
algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based
encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW
reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence
methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by
17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE
reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by
21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach
decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability
and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the brittleness of Behavioral Cloning (BC) in autonomous driving by proposing a pipeline combining BC with Offline Reinforcement Learning (CQL), achieving significantly better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BC policies are brittle and suffer from compounding errors; the study aims to improve robustness using offline RL.

Method: Develops BC baselines (including a Transformer-based model) and applies CQL with a structured state representation and engineered reward function.

Result: CQL outperforms BC with a 3.2x higher success rate and 7.4x lower collision rate in large-scale evaluations.

Conclusion: Offline RL (CQL) is essential for robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a
central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often
unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward
approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously
brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work
presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this
limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC
baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a
structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low
imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We
then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement
Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and
architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a
carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value
function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid
out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen
scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a
3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC
baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,
long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

*Tiantian He,Keyue Jiang,An Zhao,Anna Schroder,Elinor Thompson,Sonja Soskic,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stage-aware Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework is proposed to model neurodegenerative disease progression, addressing data scarcity and complex pathological mechanisms through dynamic expert weighting and inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in modeling neurodegenerative disease progression, such as irregular longitudinal data and fixed pathological mechanisms, by capturing stage-specific dynamics.

Method: Proposes IGND-MoE: a stage-aware MoE framework with inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion (IGND) and localized neural reaction modules, optimized via dual iterative methods for temporal alignment.

Result: The model reveals stage-specific mechanisms, with graph-related processes dominant early and unknown processes later, aligning with clinical literature.

Conclusion: IGND-MoE provides a flexible, principled approach to understanding neurodegenerative progression, offering insights into stage-specific pathological contributions.

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

TL;DR: OTAKNet is an online solution for noise-statistics drift in learning-based adaptive Kalman filtering, outperforming offline methods and classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing degradation of learning-based filtering due to unobserved noise-statistics drift in real-world deployments.

Method: Uses one-step predictive measurement likelihood and optimal transport for online adaptation without retraining or ground truth labels.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, especially with limited training data.

Conclusion: OTAKNet effectively mitigates noise-statistics drift, enabling robust online learning-based filtering.

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Method: Systematic evaluation of six LLM KD techniques across seven NLP tasks, using three teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, OPT) and various student sizes, analyzing impacts of KD objectives, student training data, and tasks.

Result: All KD techniques transfer privacy risks, but severity varies. Key components (objectives, data, tasks) influence risks. Discrepancy between memorization and membership risks observed. Privacy risk varies significantly across model blocks.

Conclusion: Privacy risks in LLM KD are pervasive but context-dependent, highlighting the need for risk-aware KD design and further research on mitigating these risks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high
computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge
from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may
inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In
this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and
memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using
instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three
teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student
models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and
memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the
extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We
systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions,
student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also
demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership
privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy
risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a
large margin.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'unlearn-then-learn' strategy using PEFT and $IA^3$ to update LLMs' knowledge, achieving high accuracy for new facts while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with dynamic knowledge updates, especially when new information conflicts with existing facts, leading to resistance and forgetting.

Method: A two-stage approach: circuit localization to target conflicting facts, followed by 'unlearn-then-learn' using $IA^3$.

Result: Achieves 98.50% accuracy for new facts, 96.00% forget rate for conflicting facts, and 72.00% F_control accuracy, reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The strategy advances precise, localized, and safe knowledge management in LLMs, with 'soft forgetting' enhancing model safety.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates,
especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such
conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to
adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated
knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn"
strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting
and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach
is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets
the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.
Through a rigorous experimental methodology on
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically
informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the
new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original
conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits
unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating
catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed
as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted
interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals
a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is
suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally
accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a
significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge
management in compact LLMs.

### [431] [Improving Real-Time Concept Drift Detection using a Hybrid Transformer-Autoencoder Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07085)
*N Harshit,K Mounvik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining Transformers and Autoencoders is proposed for early and sensitive online concept drift detection, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift in machine learning reduces model performance, and existing detection methods are reactive and lack sensitivity for early detection.

Method: A hybrid Transformer-Autoencoder framework with a Trust Score methodology, incorporating statistical, reconstruction, prediction uncertainty, rules violations, and classifier error trends.

Result: The framework detected drift earlier and more sensitively than baseline methods, validated on a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset with synthetic drift.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust solution for real-time concept drift detection in applied machine learning.

Abstract: In applied machine learning, concept drift, which is either gradual or abrupt
changes in data distribution, can significantly reduce model performance.
Typical detection methods,such as statistical tests or reconstruction-based
models,are generally reactive and not very sensitive to early detection. Our
study proposes a hybrid framework consisting of Transformers and Autoencoders
to model complex temporal dynamics and provide online drift detection. We
create a distinct Trust Score methodology, which includes signals on (1)
statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, more specifically, PSI,
JSD, Transformer-AE error, (2) prediction uncertainty, (3) rules violations,
and (4) trend of classifier error aligned with the combined metrics defined by
the Trust Score. Using a time sequenced airline passenger data set with
synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift
using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and
interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline
for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated
performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the
gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket
prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our
results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and
with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature,
and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations.
Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

*Yang Cao,Yubin Chen,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Second-Order MeanFlow, extending MeanFlow by incorporating average acceleration fields, proving its feasibility, expressivity, and efficient implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative modelling by extending MeanFlow with higher-order dynamics while maintaining practical sampling efficiency.

Method: Theoretical study on Second-Order MeanFlow, proving consistency, analyzing expressivity via circuit complexity, and deriving efficient implementation criteria.

Result: Second-Order MeanFlow supports stable one-step sampling, is implementable in TC0, and allows efficient attention approximations.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models combining rich dynamics with practical efficiency.

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free
paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework,
which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable
efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study
on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average
acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the
feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies
a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby
supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then
characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that
under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be
implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class.
Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by
leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention
operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to
within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results
lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine
rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

*Yiran Huang,Amirhossein Nouranizadeh,Christine Ahrends,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrainATCL is an unsupervised framework for adaptive temporal brain connectivity learning in fMRI data, outperforming conventional GNNs in tasks like functional link prediction and age estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data, which conventional GNNs struggle with.

Method: Proposes BrainATCL, a nonparametric framework with adaptive lookback windows and a GINE-Mamba2 backbone for spatial-temporal representation learning, incorporating brain structure and function-informed edge attributes.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in functional link prediction and age estimation, with strong generalization, including cross-session prediction.

Conclusion: BrainATCL effectively models dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI data, offering improved performance and biologically meaningful insights.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely
used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain
transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured
manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity
dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model
these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as
they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight
into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range
temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we
propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive
temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and
age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each
snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are
subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal
representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data
of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve
spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge
attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership
of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful
topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link
prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior
performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction
scenarios.

*Atakan Azakli,Bernd Stelzer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new ML method enhances prediction precision and discriminative power in challenging hypotheses testing, reducing errors and leveraging MIL for better performance, demonstrated with SMEFT constraints at LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ML prediction accuracy and discriminative power in difficult cases, particularly where state-of-the-art classifiers struggle.

Method: Proposes a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach, analyzing its scaling behavior with instances and applying it to constrain SMEFT Wilson coefficients using LHC data.

Result: Shows MIL's superior predictive power and potential to extract maximum Fisher Information from datasets under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances ML precision and discriminative capability, with practical applications in particle physics.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain
more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses
testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more
discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This
method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in
their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their
single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing
the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to
the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete
application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle
collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain
circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher
Information latent in a dataset.

*Peyman Baghershahi,Gregoire Fournier,Pranav Nyati,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOGIC is a lightweight framework using LLMs to generate interpretable explanations for GNN predictions by aligning GNN embeddings with LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN explanation methods struggle with fine-grained rationales for text-attributed graphs.

Method: LOGIC projects GNN embeddings into LLM space, using hybrid prompts to generate natural language explanations and subgraphs.

Result: LOGIC improves fidelity, sparsity, and human-centric metrics like insightfulness across four datasets.

Conclusion: LOGIC advances LLM-based explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human reasoning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over
structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains
such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not
inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed.
However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable,
fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural
language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable
explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the
LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts
with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason
about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations
along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four
real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off
between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric
metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based
explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human
reasoning.

*Zhihao Xue,Yun Zi,Nia Qi,Ming Gong,Yujun Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spatiotemporal graph neural network predicts performance in distributed backend systems by modeling service states and call relationships, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of forecasting performance fluctuations in distributed systems with complex service call structures.

Method: Combines graph convolutional networks for dependency extraction and gated recurrent networks for temporal dynamics, enhanced with time encoding for non-stationary sequences.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in MAE, RMSE, and R2 metrics, showing robustness under varying loads and structures.

Conclusion: The model is effective for backend service performance management, demonstrating practical potential.

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance
prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance
fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call
structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a
sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service
nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified
spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph
convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the
service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic
evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also
introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal
sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the
multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future
service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of
multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time
windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate
the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show
that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key
metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying
load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the
model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pref-GUIDE transforms noisy real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data for better reward model learning in online reinforcement learning, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is essential for tasks with hard-to-specify objectives, but scalar feedback is noisy and inconsistent, limiting reward model accuracy.

Method: Pref-GUIDE converts scalar feedback into preferences, using short-window comparisons (Individual) and population consensus (Voting) to improve robustness.

Result: Pref-GUIDE outperforms scalar-feedback baselines in three environments, with the Voting variant surpassing expert-designed dense rewards.

Conclusion: Pref-GUIDE provides a scalable, principled method for leveraging human input in online reinforcement learning by reframing feedback as structured preferences.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when
task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While
prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human
preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents
must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time
scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued
learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is
often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of
learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time
scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for
continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal
inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering
ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by
aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus
preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly
outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even
expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured
preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and
principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement
learning.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs predict CVD risk and SNPs using genomic data, showing promise for early detection and personalized medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of CVD prediction due to its complex etiology and the difficulty of extracting insights from high-dimensional genomic data.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs to analyze genetic markers and patterns, framed as a Chain of Thought reasoning task for disease prediction.

Result: LLMs effectively predict cardiac diseases and SNPs, learning latent biological relationships from genomic data.

Conclusion: LLMs hold potential for early CVD detection, risk assessment, and advancing personalized cardiac care.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

### [439] [A Globally Optimal Analytic Solution for Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Nonnegative or Mixed Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07134)
*Lu Chenggang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for globally optimal semi-NMF is proposed, outperforming existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative, non-convex, and prone to local minima, necessitating a globally optimal solution.

Method: The method derives an orthogonal decomposition from the scatter matrix of input data, ensuring global optimality under the Frobenius norm.

Result: The solution achieves the global minimum of reconstruction error and outperforms standard NMF and semi-NMF methods, especially in low-rank cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides theoretical guarantees and empirical advantages, advancing matrix factorization in optimization and data analysis.

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain
both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data
with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative,
non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the
Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter
matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the
global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower
reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the
basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases
such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative
factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our
method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal,
non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical
advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization
and data analysis.

TL;DR: The paper critiques Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for its theoretical misalignment and instability, proposing a novel loss function derived from RLHF optimality to ensure stability and better alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's loss function promotes indefinite logits difference maximization, causing instability and reward hacking. The paper aims to address this by targeting a finite logits difference.

Method: A new loss function is derived from RLHF optimality, focusing on finite logits difference. Theoretical analysis and gradient comparisons validate its stability.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with the proposed loss shows win-rate improvements over DPO and competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function avoids DPO's pitfalls, ensuring stable training and effective alignment, validated by superior empirical results.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is
commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a
direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating
the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss
function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes
the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training
instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function
derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets
a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the
underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical
analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method
avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred
responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and
leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a
Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO
baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like
Llama-3.1-8B.

*Yashwant Krishna Pagoti,Arunesh Sinha,Shamik Sural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper models the privacy-accuracy trade-off in Federated Learning (FL) as a game, introducing a token-based incentivization mechanism to balance client privacy and global model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation in global model accuracy caused by noise addition for privacy in FL, while ensuring clients' privacy is preserved.

Method: A game-theoretic approach is used where the server incentivizes clients to add less noise via a token-based system. Clients earn tokens based on gradient perturbation and spend them to access updated models.

Result: Strategic analysis and experiments show the impact of parameters on the privacy-accuracy trade-off, demonstrating the effectiveness of the token mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed game-theoretic framework successfully balances privacy and accuracy in FL, with the token system effectively incentivizing optimal client behavior.

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning
model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over
multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of
sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In
LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending
the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of
clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we
model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes
the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while
the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss
in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the
quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the
degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly
updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be
deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff,
and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were
carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

*Vincent-Daniel Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how low-precision training affects SGD convergence, showing gradient shrinkage slows it down and quantization noise increases error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of gradient quantization on SGD convergence, given its computational benefits in large-scale deep learning.

Method: Model gradient quantization as shrinkage and noise, then analyze SGD convergence under smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions.

Result: Low-precision SGD converges but slower due to shrinkage and has higher error from noise.

Conclusion: Quantization slows training and increases asymptotic error, but convergence is still guaranteed.

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational
and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of
gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can
alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where
each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by
zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to
replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$,
which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and
bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges,
but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased
asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how
reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient
shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

TL;DR: A two-layer, single-head transformer can represent any kth-order Markov process, providing the tightest known link between transformer depth and Markov order for in-context learning (ICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether a two-layer, single-head transformer can represent higher-order Markov processes, a gap left by prior work.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing a two-layer transformer with one head per layer can represent any conditional k-gram. Learning dynamics are also analyzed for a simplified first-order Markov chain variant.

Result: A two-layer transformer with one head per layer can represent any kth-order Markov process, demonstrating strong ICL capabilities even in shallow architectures.

Conclusion: The study deepens understanding of transformer-based ICL, showing shallow architectures can effectively handle structured sequence modeling tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through
which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from
the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to
the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence
between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling
sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of
model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can
efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart
cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher
order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three
layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a
two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In
this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer
transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional
k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the
interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,
we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,
focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating
how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,
these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and
illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL
capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

TL;DR: Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs) improve stochastic function modeling by dynamically anchoring inputs to the diffusion trajectory, ensuring endpoint coherence and stronger gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models like GPs and NPs have limitations in scalability, flexibility, and capturing multi-modal distributions. NDPs improve expressivity but suffer from weak input coupling and semantic mismatch.

Method: NBPs reformulate the forward kernel to explicitly depend on inputs, enforcing a constrained diffusion path that strictly terminates at the target.

Result: NBPs outperform baselines on synthetic data, EEG signal regression, and image regression tasks.

Conclusion: NBPs enhance performance and theoretical consistency for structured prediction tasks using DDPM-style bridge sampling.

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is
a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like
Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume
Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer
more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target
distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a
learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the
denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional
forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work,
we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling
stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire
diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend
on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the
supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals
but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG
signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial
improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of
DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical
consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using LLM-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis in causal ML, reducing human dependency and improving robustness in treatment effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in estimating individualized treatment effects due to unmeasured confounding, structural bias, and high annotation costs in causal ML methods.

Method: Proposed LLM-based agents to automate confounder discovery and subgroup analysis, integrating them into the causal ML pipeline.

Result: Improved robustness in treatment effect estimation by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized biases in real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents provide a scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware solution for causal inference.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents
a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias.
Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly
robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment
effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world
environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in
unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder
identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and
scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based
agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate
agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework
systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure
discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which
reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on
real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment
effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering
unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents
offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware
causal inference.

### [446] [EDGE: A Theoretical Framework for Misconception-Aware Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07224)
*Ananda Prakash Verma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDGE is a misconception-aware adaptive learning framework with four stages: Evaluate, Diagnose, Generate, and Exercise. It integrates psychometrics, cognitive diagnostics, contrastive item generation, and principled scheduling, introducing EdgeScore for readiness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misconceptions in learning by unifying psychometrics, cognitive diagnostics, and adaptive scheduling for more effective personalized education.

Method: EDGE combines IRT/Bayesian models, misconception discovery, contrastive item generation, and restless bandit scheduling. EdgeScore and an index policy are derived for optimal performance.

Result: Theoretical proofs show EdgeScore's monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity, and counterfactual items reduce misconceptions faster than standard practice under certain conditions.

Conclusion: EDGE provides a theoretical and implementable framework for adaptive learning, with empirical validation left for future work.

Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning
framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation),
Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual
item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies
psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics
(misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies),
contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner
shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling
(a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite
readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity,
and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on
forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which
counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted
misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and
implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

*Chu Zhao,Eneng Yang,Yizhou Dang,Jianzhe Zhao,Guibing Guo,Xingwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNSDiff improves recommendation performance by using diffusion-based negative sampling to avoid biases from predefined candidate pools and enhance OOD generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heuristic negative sampling can introduce false hard negatives due to environmental confounders, harming model generalization.

Method: Proposes CNSDiff, a method using conditional diffusion to synthesize unbiased negative samples and a causal regularization term to mitigate confounders.

Result: Achieves 13.96% average improvement in OOD scenarios over baselines.

Conclusion: CNSDiff effectively reduces bias and enhances robustness in recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting
negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to
guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our
empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental
confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause
heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These
misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations
induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability
under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method
named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing
negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,
CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus
reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal
regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental
confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives
that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive
experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate
that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and
robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.

*Soumen Pachal,Mizhaan Prajit Maniyar,Prashanth L. A*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning method using distortion risk metrics (DRM) and a cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm, ensuring convergence to a second-order stationary point with proven sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of risk-sensitive control in RL by optimizing DRM, a versatile class of risk measures, and ensuring convergence beyond saddle points.

Method: Derives a policy Hessian theorem for DRM, proposes a Hessian estimator, and introduces a cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm for on-policy RL.

Result: The algorithm converges to an ε-SOSP with sample complexity O(ε^{-3.5}), validated by experiments.

Conclusion: This is the first work to achieve ε-SOSP convergence for a risk-sensitive objective, advancing beyond prior first-order or risk-neutral results.

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by
maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite
horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures
that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a
policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method.
Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample
trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy
Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using
estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to
converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of
the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points.
The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical
findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present
convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing
works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order
stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral
one.

*Bartlomiej Chybowski,Shima Abdullateef,Hollan Haule,Alfredo Gonzalez-Sulser,Javier Escudero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An open-source machine-learning framework for robust and generalizable seizure detection across diverse EEG datasets, achieving high performance and cross-dataset transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current seizure detection relies on manual EEG interpretation, and existing machine-learning methods lack generalizability due to dataset-specific optimizations.

Method: The framework includes automated pre-processing, majority voting for decision-making, and cross-dataset evaluation without post-processing.

Result: High within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904 for CHB-MIT, 0.864 for TUSZ) and strong cross-dataset generalization (AUC 0.615-0.762). Mild post-processing further improved results.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reproducible, clinically viable solution for seizure detection, complementing expert interpretation and accelerating adoption.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

TL;DR: The paper reviews influence functions in deep learning for data attribution, covering theory, algorithmic advances, and applications like mislabel detection, while addressing challenges for real-world scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual training examples influence model predictions, aiding interpretability, debugging, and accountability in machine learning.

Method: Uses influence functions for efficient approximation of data impact without retraining, focusing on inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation.

Result: Influence functions effectively attribute data impact and detect mislabels, but scalability in large-scale scenarios remains a challenge.

Conclusion: Influence functions hold promise for deep learning interpretability, but further research is needed to address scalability and real-world applicability.

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the
learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most
influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads
to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples
influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning
interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence
functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order
approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a
data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions,
without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews
the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We
discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for
efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their
effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally,
highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the
huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning
scenarios.

*Lin-Han Jia,Si-Yu Han,Wen-Chao Hu,Jie-Jing Shao,Wen-Da Wei,Zhi Zhou,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies neuro-symbolic (Nesy) and semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) theories, proposing metrics to predict pretext task effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between heuristic-based pretext task selection and theory-driven approaches in SSL and Nesy learning.

Method: Extends Nesy theory to unreliable knowledge, identifies three key factors (learnability, reliability, completeness), and proposes operational schemes.

Result: High correlation between predicted and actual performance validates the theory and evaluation method.

Conclusion: The framework enables theory-based pretext task selection, improving SSL and Nesy learning efficiency.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models
by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning
(SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext
tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We
extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of
unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical
frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance
hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,
knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with
respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these
theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the
effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status
quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are
heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the
rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on
the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the
predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance
achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus
confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation
method.

*Tuo Zhang,Ning Li,Xin Yuan,Wenchao Xu,Quan Chen,Song Guo,Haijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient MoE edge deployment scheme using Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) and CPU-GPU collaboration to address quantization accuracy and memory challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to quantization accuracy loss and memory limitations in MoE architectures.

Method: The method combines smoothed Hessian matrix quantization for 8-bit joint quantization of activations and weights, and a CPU-GPU collaborative offloading mechanism for efficient expert module deployment.

Result: Experiments show the quantized model achieves near full-precision accuracy, reduces GPU memory by ~60%, and improves inference latency on models like OPT and Mixtral 8*7B.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for MoE model deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on
resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse
activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The
presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe
degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,
significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,
efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to
balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)
and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian
matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and
weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers
while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we
design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,
combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment
and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory
footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series
and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of
the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while
GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is
significantly improved.

Motivation: Stochastic interpolants show promise for generative modeling, but lack rigorous finite-time convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes.

Method: The study examines two numerical integrators (forward Euler and Heun's method) for ODEs from stochastic interpolants, deriving error bounds and optimizing schedules.

Result: Novel finite-time error bounds in total variation distance are established, and numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of stochastic interpolants' numerical implementations, offering practical insights for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously
transforming samples between arbitrary data distributions, holding significant
promise for generative modeling. Despite their potential, rigorous finite-time
convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of
numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived
from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time
error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical
integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's
method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific
stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance
computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by
numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity
analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PVP prediction is vital for genomic studies, but existing methods lack spatial constraints. ProteoKnight addresses this gap.

Method: Adapts DNA-Walk for proteins, uses pixel colors and adjusted walk distances, and employs pre-trained CNNs for classification with uncertainty analysis via MCD.

Result: 90.8% accuracy in binary PVP classification, with variability in prediction confidence based on protein class and sequence length.

Conclusion: ProteoKnight outperforms FCGR by mitigating spatial loss, providing accurate PVP predictions and identifying low-confidence cases.

Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is
essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements
in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have
emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing.
However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our
paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses
spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in
PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP
classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:}
ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences,
incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate
protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained
CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across
proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments
achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains
suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction
confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length.
\textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation

loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP
predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional spaces can be simplified using lower-dimensional structures (implicit bias). It introduces a criterion for intrinsic dynamics and applies it to ReLU and linear networks, generalizing balanced initializations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if high-dimensional gradient flows can be reduced to simpler, lower-dimensional dynamics, aiding the study of implicit bias in deep learning.

Method: The study introduces an intrinsic dynamic property and a criterion based on kernel inclusion. It applies this to ReLU and linear networks, including relaxed balanced initializations.

Result: For ReLU networks, the flow can be rewritten as intrinsic dynamics in lower dimensions. For linear networks, relaxed balanced initializations are shown to enable dimensionality reduction.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights into dimensionality reduction in gradient flows, generalizing results for ReLU and linear networks, and identifies conditions for intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand
whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be
captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called
implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a
high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a
lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related
function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how
it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the
factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion
of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property
to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth
and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an
intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the
initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of
linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced
initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we
generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced}
initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the
\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.
Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep
linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express
the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores generative modeling and unpaired image-to-image translation using Schrödinger bridges and stochastic optimal control, focusing on scenarios where only i.i.d. samples from initial and final distributions are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of transforming an initial density to a target one optimally, particularly in cases where direct access to distributions is limited to samples.

Method: The approach uses an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a reference, estimates the Schrödinger potential, and introduces a risk function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence between couplings.

Result: Tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical risk minimizer are derived, achieving near-fast convergence rates in favorable scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for generative modeling and image-to-image translation, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image
translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control
theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way.
In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from
initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both
generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the
stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as
the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential.
Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical
risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian
mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we
almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in
favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach
with numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether combining input-independent and non-negative SSMs in multilayer models can solve state-tracking tasks like parity, concluding that such combinations fail and require input-dependent transitions with negative eigenvalues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of state-tracking capability in LRNN models like S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet due to time-invariant transition matrices or restricted eigenvalue ranges.

Method: Analyze multilayer SSMs with diagonal transition matrices to test if combining input-independent and non-negative SSMs can solve parity tasks.

Result: Combining these SSM types still fails to solve parity, indicating the need for input-dependent transitions with negative eigenvalues.

Conclusion: A recurrence layer must be input-dependent and include negative eigenvalues to solve state-tracking tasks, as supported by experiments combining S4D and Mamba layers.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack
state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or
restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition
matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been
proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems
demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of
solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they
do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could
help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition
matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This
implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include
negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an
SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

*Mohamad Louai Shehab,Alperen Tercan,Necmiye Ozay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses recovering time-varying reward functions from optimal policies or demonstrations in max entropy RL, using sparsity and linear feature priors for efficient solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward recovery is ill-posed without assumptions, but practical applications often have parsimonious rewards with prior information.

Method: Two priors are used: 1) rewards are mostly constant, 2) rewards are linear combinations of few features. The problem is reformulated as sparsification or rank minimization with linear constraints.

Result: Polynomial-time algorithms and convex relaxations solve the problems efficiently, with examples showing accurate and generalizable reward recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed priors and optimization methods enable efficient and accurate reward identification in RL.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward
functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max
entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed
without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many
applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information
is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly
constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a
linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that
the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a
sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.
Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of
features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear
constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both
cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward
identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the
accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

Method: DeepLight uses a dual-encoder architecture with multi-source data (radar, cloud properties, historical lightning) and multi-branch convolution for spatial correlations. A Hazy Loss function handles spatio-temporal uncertainty.

Result: DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DeepLight is a robust solution for lightning prediction, outperforming existing models and addressing their key limitations.

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses
significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses.
These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate
prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,
protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present
DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning
occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they
often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty
of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar
reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly
sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight
leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud
properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder
architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically
captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel
Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of
lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling
the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments
show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over
state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning
prediction.

### [460] [Unsupervised operator learning approach for dissipative equations via Onsager principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07440)
*Zhipeng Chang,Zhenye Wen,Xiaofei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOOL is an unsupervised operator learning method for dissipative equations, avoiding costly labeled data by minimizing the Rayleighian functional derived from the Onsager variational principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on expensive supervised training with simulation data, which is computationally costly.

Method: DOOL uses the Onsager variational principle to train a deep operator network without labeled data, employing a spatiotemporal decoupling strategy for efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments show DOOL's effectiveness, outperforming supervised methods like DeepONet and MIONet.

Conclusion: DOOL offers a promising unsupervised alternative for solving dissipative equations, with potential extensions to more complex models.

Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with
high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In
this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel
unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager
variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly
minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,
and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the
solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling
strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates
exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external
time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical
dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and
systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its
enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models
with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

*Fernando Martinez,Tao Li,Yingdong Lu,Juntao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCORER framework improves RL performance by structuring perception-control interaction as a Stackelberg game, avoiding complex auxiliary objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of learning effective features from sparse rewards without decoupling or naive end-to-end learning.

Method: Introduces SCORER, modeling perception-control interaction as a Stackelberg game with a two-timescale algorithm for equilibrium.

Result: Improves sample efficiency and final performance in benchmark tasks with standard DQN variants.

Conclusion: Principled design of perception-control dynamics can enhance performance without auxiliary complexity.

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a
cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the
challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent
trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully
decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.
This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end
learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring
the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a
principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing
the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)
framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a
Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features
to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize
its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical
two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,
SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that
performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the
perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or
architectures.

*Wei Qian,Chenxu Zhao,Yangyi Li,Wenqian Ye,Mengdi Huai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces malicious unlearning attacks targeting predictive uncertainties in deep learning models, showing their effectiveness and the inadequacy of existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in predictive uncertainties due to malicious unlearning attacks, a previously unaddressed issue.

Method: Proposes a new class of attacks with novel optimization frameworks, tested in black-box scenarios.

Result: Attacks are more effective at manipulating uncertainties than traditional label-focused attacks, and current defenses fail against them.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for new defenses against uncertainty-targeted malicious unlearning attacks.

Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to
provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label
predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten,
machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact
of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the
model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive
uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain
unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of
malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the
adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive
uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our
attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.
Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in
manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on
label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks
are ineffective against our attacks.

TL;DR: MOTGNN is a novel framework for multi-omics data integration, improving disease classification accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dimensionality and complex interactions in multi-omics data challenge predictive modeling, necessitating a robust and interpretable solution.

Method: MOTGNN uses XGBoost for graph construction, modality-specific GNNs for representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration.

Result: MOTGNN outperforms baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and handles class imbalance well.

Conclusion: MOTGNN enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and
microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological
mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex
interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive
modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural
Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease
classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

### [464] [Online Convex Optimization with Heavy Tails: Old Algorithms, New Regrets, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07473)
*Zijian Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Online Convex Optimization (OCO) in heavy-tailed gradient settings, proving optimal regret bounds for classical methods without modifications. It also extends to nonsmooth nonconvex optimization and broader OCO settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of results for OCO when gradients have heavy tails (finite p-th central moment, p ∈ (1,2]). It aims to show that classical methods work optimally in such settings without extra steps like gradient clipping.

Method: The paper revisits classical OCO algorithms (e.g., Online Gradient Descent) under heavy-tailed gradients, analyzing their performance without modifications. It also extends the analysis to broader settings like smooth OCO and optimistic algorithms.

Result: The paper establishes optimal regret bounds for classical OCO methods in heavy-tailed settings, showing no need for gradient clipping. It also provides the first convergence result for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise.

Conclusion: Classical OCO methods perform optimally under heavy-tailed gradients without modifications. The results have broad applications, including nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, and extend to other settings like smooth OCO.

Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a
finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear
regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy
tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th
central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this
work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)
in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain
assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any
algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in
all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting
that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation
(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A
particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for
nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and
extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases
simultaneously.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: N-BEATS-MOE extends N-BEATS with a Mixture-of-Experts layer, improving adaptability and interpretability for time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance N-BEATS by incorporating a dynamic weighting strategy to better handle heterogeneous time series and improve interpretability.

Method: Uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer with a gating network for dynamic block weighting, adapting to each time series's characteristics.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements on benchmark datasets, especially for heterogeneous time series.

Conclusion: N-BEATS-MOE outperforms other methods, offering better adaptability and interpretability in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series
forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on
benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable
relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into
different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,
we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a
gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of
each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides
additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for
each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against
several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets,
especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

*Yueyang Quan,Chang Wang,Shengjie Zhai,Minghong Fang,Zhuqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DPMixSGD, a privacy-preserving algorithm for decentralized min-max optimization, ensuring privacy via differential privacy without compromising convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks in decentralized min-max optimization due to model update sharing, necessitating a solution that balances privacy and performance.

Method: DPMixSGD, a novel algorithm combining differential privacy with STORM-based decentralized min-max optimization, ensuring theoretical privacy and convergence guarantees.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation shows DPMixSGD maintains convergence while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: DPMixSGD effectively addresses privacy concerns in decentralized min-max optimization without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to
collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the
exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a
central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of
exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy
concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become
a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its
advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses
challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in
non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization
problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential
Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving
algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max
optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm,
one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that
the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise
convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy
guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive
experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairDRL-ST is a novel framework using disentangled representation learning to address fairness in spatio-temporal predictions, particularly in mobility demand forecasting, without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain groups, reinforcing inequalities and undermining ethical AI deployment in public services.

Method: The framework leverages adversarial and disentangled representation learning to separate sensitive attributes, achieving fairness unsupervisedly.

Result: Applied to real-world urban mobility datasets, FairDRL-ST closes fairness gaps while maintaining competitive predictive performance.

Conclusion: FairDRL-ST effectively balances fairness and performance in spatio-temporal predictions, offering a practical solution for ethical AI deployment.

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban
computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on
users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency
services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods
focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to
growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can
disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,
thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the
ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to
address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular
focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and
disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate
attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that
enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to
overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in
an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to
real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close
fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to
state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

TL;DR: A physics-informed multimodal CNN with late fusion integrates vibration and motor current signals, outperforming baselines in bearing fault classification under variable conditions. Transfer learning strategies further enhance generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is crucial for rotating machinery reliability, especially under domain shifts.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed multimodal CNN with late fusion, incorporating a physics-based loss function and evaluating transfer learning strategies (TSFT, LAS, HFR).

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieves 98% accuracy on KAIST dataset, and shows significant improvements via statistical testing.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge with data-driven learning enhances robustness and generalizability for industrial fault diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for
ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable
operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model
performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and
motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction
branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that
penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing
fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency
Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive
experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed
physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed
baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and
improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance
degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)
strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy
(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS
yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined
with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset
confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98
percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant
improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven
learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis
for real-world industrial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on optimizing remote inference accuracy by scheduling two modalities dynamically, minimizing inference error using an index-based threshold policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fresh sensor data is crucial for accurate ML inference, but network limitations hinder timely delivery of all modalities.

Method: Developed an index-based threshold policy for modality switching, proven optimal for non-monotonic, non-additive AoI functions and heterogeneous transmission times.

Result: Policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to round-robin and random scheduling.

Conclusion: Optimizing task-oriented AoI functions can significantly improve remote inference accuracy.

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a
multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using
features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change
dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.
However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due
to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling
problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a
penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based
threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches
modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We
show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index
functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our
policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and
\emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical
results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to
round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based
inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote
inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty estimation in ML for safer, more reliable systems, introducing lightweight methods for selective prediction, analyzing privacy-uncertainty trade-offs, and addressing adversarial manipulation of uncertainty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the safety and trustworthiness of ML systems in high-stakes domains by improving uncertainty estimation and selective prediction.

Method: Proposes a post-hoc abstention method using model training trajectories, analyzes privacy-uncertainty trade-offs under differential privacy, decomposes selective classification errors, and designs defenses against adversarial manipulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance, robust uncertainty estimation under privacy constraints, and identifies error sources in selective classification.

Conclusion: Advances reliable ML by improving uncertainty estimation, enabling models to abstain when uncertain, and safeguarding against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how
uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,
focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is
low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty
signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By
ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,
post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep
ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.
Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),
allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find
that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains
robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty
trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective
classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --
identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions
can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking
errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show
that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or
deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining
calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,
and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make
accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

*Nisha Chandramoorthy,Adriaan de Clercq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why some generative models remain robust in their support despite learning errors, revealing that alignment of Lyapunov vectors with the data manifold's tangent spaces ensures robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the phenomenon where generative models' samples shift along the data distribution's support but not away from it, despite learning errors.

Method: A dynamical systems approach is used, analyzing perturbations in the probability flow and alignment of Lyapunov vectors with the data manifold's tangent spaces.

Result: Infinitesimal learning errors affect the predicted density only on the data manifold, and alignment of Lyapunov vectors ensures robustness.

Conclusion: The alignment condition is efficient to compute and provides theoretical guarantees for robustness in various generative models.

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the
following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector
field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the
data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate
this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical
systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our
perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal
learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target
density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.
Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the
support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive
infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the
boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient
condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.
Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for
robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the
tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation
analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements
and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative
models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty
quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical
generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative
models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the
manifold hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing reproducibility issues in high-performance inference models due to incomplete training details.

Method: Uses long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), with proposed Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO).

Result: Achieves 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5, and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Conclusion: High-quality data and GPPO enhance reasoning capabilities, making Klear-Reasoner a standout model in mathematics and programming tasks.

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that
demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding
performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many
excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are
still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to
incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow
from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long
CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies
for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a
small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large
number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better
results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues
with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical
exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)
that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only
enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in
learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning
abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\%
on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

*Advait Parulekar,Litu Rout,Karthikeyan Shanmugam,Sanjay Shakkottai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses posterior sampling in score-based generative models, proposing a tractable method to approximate the posterior under minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling is intractable in KL divergence under computational hardness assumptions, yet empirical success exists in tasks like image super-resolution. The goal is to find a general solution without restrictive assumptions.

Method: The paper frames the problem as 'tilting'—biasing a distribution towards a measurement. It shows tractable sampling from a distribution close to the noised prior's posterior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence.

Result: The method ensures samples are consistent with both the measurement and prior, providing the first formal results for approximate posterior sampling in polynomial time.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for posterior sampling in score-based models, balancing computational feasibility and accuracy.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based
generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a
measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior
$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)
under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular
algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and
reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional
assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is
tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a
distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one
can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the
posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher
divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is
consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior
sampling in polynomial time.

*Huiqi Deng,Hongbin Pei,Quanshi Zhang,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in evaluating the faithfulness of attribution methods for explaining DNNs and highlights recent theoretical advances to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address unresolved concerns about whether attribution methods accurately reflect input contributions to DNN decisions, undermining their reliability.

Method: The paper identifies three core challenges: unstructured heterogeneity of methods, lack of theoretical underpinnings, and empirical evaluation difficulties. It reviews recent theoretical advances in unification, rationale, and evaluation.

Result: Recent theoretical developments offer systematic comparisons, clarify method foundations, and rigorously evaluate faithfulness, aiding method selection and inspiring new approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with insights into deepening theoretical understanding and identifies open problems for future research in attribution methods.

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural
networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input
variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods
have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains
unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the
actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The
faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of
attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core
challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to
their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and
implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack
solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,
ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is
challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a
promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We
summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)
Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among
methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,
clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,
rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a
comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen
theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution
methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further
work.

*Guanqun Ma,David Lenz,Hanqi Guo,Tom Peterka,Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for extracting complex topological features directly from continuous implicit models like MFA, enabling topological analysis without discrete representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage continuous implicit models for scientific data by enabling direct extraction of topological features, avoiding the need for discrete representations.

Method: Introduces a framework to extract features (contours, Jacobi sets, ridge-valley graphs) from MFA models using function values and high-order derivatives.

Result: Enables direct topological feature extraction from continuous implicit models, generalizable to other similar models.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational steps for topological data analysis and visualization on continuous implicit models.

Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural
networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data
representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates.
These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of
scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly
extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley
graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate
functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous
piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach
enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model,
without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily
generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of
function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building
blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit
continuous models.

*Jia Zhang,Yao Liu,Chen-Xi Zhang,Yi Liu,Yi-Xuan Jin,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) to address noise and conflicts in fine-grained preference datasets, proposing a data selection principle based on Preference Divergence (PD) for efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with diverse human values requires handling noisy and conflicting aspect-specific preference data, which existing methods like DPO struggle with.

Method: Derives DMPO objective, identifies PD term for inter-aspect conflicts, and formulates a data selection principle using high-consensus data (most negative PD values). Introduces PD estimation and bias mitigation methods.

Result: Achieves over 10% relative improvement on UltraFeedback dataset compared to standard holistic preference and oracle methods, enhancing training efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed PD selection method enables robust LLM alignment using fine-grained preference signals without needing holistic preference annotations.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires
moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While
collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and
scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle
with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In
this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first
derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a
key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference
conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it
to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our
principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by
the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality
of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the
selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical
methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our
PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying
conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%
relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a
stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting
training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference
annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained
preference signals.

*Xiaoxue Yang,Jaeha Lee,Anna-Katharina Dick,Jasper Timm,Fei Xie,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs are as effective as resampling single-turn attacks, with success rates over 70%. Attack success correlates among similar models, and higher reasoning effort increases success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effectiveness of multi-turn jailbreak attacks on state-of-the-art LLMs and challenge their perceived sophistication.

Method: Empirical analysis using the StrongREJECT benchmark on models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants.

Result: Multi-turn attacks are no more sophisticated than resampling single-turn attacks, with high success rates and correlation among similar models. Higher reasoning effort boosts attack success.

Conclusion: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are simpler than assumed, with implications for AI safety evaluation and jailbreak-resistant system design.

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent
vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models
optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis
of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models
including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark.
Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when
accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful
requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to
simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success
is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly
released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that
higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results
have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of
jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at

*Hyeon-Ju Jeon,Jeon-Ho Kang,In-Hyuk Kwon,O-Joun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study improves atmospheric state forecasting by using STGNNs with adaptive edge sampling to handle dynamic spatial correlations between Earth observations and NWP grid points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance forecasting accuracy by addressing the limitations of conventional NWP systems and dynamic spatial correlations.

Method: Employed STGNNs with adaptive edge sampling, regulating node degrees and spatial distances to prevent structural information loss and over-smoothing.

Result: Outperformed existing STGNN models in high-variability regions using real-world East Asia data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles dynamic spatial correlations, improving forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations
and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global
atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional
numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather
forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,
which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and
newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding
meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make
spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To
handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,
structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural
information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To
solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node
degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and
observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using
real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas
with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing
STGNN models with and without structure learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLiClass, a novel method adapting GLiNER for sequence classification, balances accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility for zero-shot and few-shot learning, while using PPO for multi-label tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems need efficient, accurate classification with dynamic requirements, but existing methods (LLMs, cross-encoders, embeddings) have limitations like inconsistency, inefficiency, or poor handling of complex constraints.

Method: Proposes GLiClass, adapting GLiNER for sequence classification, and uses PPO for multi-label tasks in data-sparse or feedback-driven scenarios.

Result: GLiClass achieves strong accuracy and efficiency, comparable to embedding methods, with flexibility for zero-shot and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: GLiClass addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a balanced solution for dynamic classification needs.

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,
enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

*Hyobin Park,Jinwook Jung,Minseok Seo,Hyunsoo Choi,Deukjae Cho,Sekil Park,Dong-Geol Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIS-LLM integrates AIS data with a large language model (LLM) for simultaneous trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches address maritime tasks individually, lacking holistic analysis. AIS-LLM aims to unify these tasks for better maritime traffic management.

Method: AIS-LLM combines a Time-Series Encoder, LLM-based Prompt Encoder, Cross-Modality Alignment Module, and Multi-Task Decoder for end-to-end processing.

Result: AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods in trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment.

Conclusion: AIS-LLM enables intelligent maritime traffic management by integrating multiple tasks and generating situation summaries.

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent
and efficient maritime traffic management.

*Xutong Liu,Baran Atalar,Xiangxiang Dai,Jinhang Zuo,Siwei Wang,John C. S. Lui,Wei Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction in LLMs addresses scalability and sustainability by optimizing responses under unknown query and cost distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs of LLMs and inefficiencies of traditional caching methods necessitate a principled, adaptive solution for semantic caching.

Method: Proposes offline optimization and online learning algorithms for semantic cache eviction, accounting for unknown query and cost distributions.

Result: Algorithms show matching or superior performance compared to baselines on a synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, adaptive solution for semantic caching in LLMs with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with
information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability
and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be
retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one
possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the
semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.
Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic
similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:
one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached
responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities
and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing
semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations
and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a
principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown
query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online
learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms
with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic
dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior
performance compared with baselines.

### [483] [Multi-Hop Privacy Propagation for Differentially Private Federated Learning in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07676)
*Chenchen Lin,Xuehe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a socially-aware privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) mechanism to address indirect privacy leakage in networked clients, using a Stackelberg game and mean-field estimator for optimal incentives and privacy budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy in FL is compromised by multi-hop interactions in social networks, where a client's privacy loss depends on others' decisions. Existing methods lack systematic handling of these externalities.

Method: A two-stage Stackelberg game models server-client interactions, with clients selecting privacy budgets via noise control. A mean-field estimator approximates average external privacy risk.

Result: The mechanism achieves near-optimal social welfare, improves client utilities, reduces server costs, and maintains model performance, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances privacy and collaboration in FL, addressing networked privacy risks while optimizing incentives and performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and
facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.
However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's
privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on
the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop
interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL
mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a
multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a
two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes
incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their
privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling
the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked
privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the
average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and
convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive
closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being
designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves
approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)
analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while
maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)
baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORE-CLEAR is a multimodal offline RL framework using LLMs to enhance sepsis management by integrating clinical notes with structured data, improving patient state representation and treatment outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early sepsis detection and optimal management are critical, but existing RL approaches lack comprehensive patient understanding due to reliance on structured data alone.

Method: MORE-CLEAR uses LLMs for semantic extraction from clinical notes, gated fusion, and cross-modal attention to integrate multimodal data dynamically.

Result: The framework outperforms single-modal RL in survival rates and policy performance across MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and a private dataset.

Conclusion: MORE-CLEAR is the first to combine LLMs with multimodal offline RL for sepsis, offering a more comprehensive patient understanding and better treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ
dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on
structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a
comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we
propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes
Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis
control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale
language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic
representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving
patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow
dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration
of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly
improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to
single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM
capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in
medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and
management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose
enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient
conditions.

TL;DR: Proposes SE-LLM, a semantic-enhanced LLM for time series forecasting, addressing modality gaps and enhancing interpretability by embedding periodicity and anomalies into token embeddings. Introduces a plugin module for better short-term anomaly modeling and reduces computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting methods focus on token-level alignment, ignoring the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge and time series patterns, limiting semantic representation.

Method: SE-LLM embeds time series periodicity and anomalies into token embeddings to enhance interpretability. A plugin module in self-attention models long-term and short-term dependencies, with frozen LLM and reduced token dimensionality for efficiency.

Result: SE-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: SE-LLM effectively bridges the modality gap, enhances interpretability, and improves time series forecasting performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how parallelization in neural network training affects energy consumption, showing linear scaling with GPU hours but varying factors based on model and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing energy consumption in training neural networks due to increased computational demands, with parallelization's impact often overlooked.

Method: Scaling experiments for data-parallel training of ResNet50 and FourCastNet, evaluating GPU count, global/local batch sizes, and their effects on performance, time, and energy.

Result: Energy consumption scales linearly with GPU hours, but scaling factors vary by model and hardware, influenced by samples and gradient updates per GPU hour.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complex relationship between scaling and energy use, guiding future sustainable AI research.

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks
leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has
enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact
on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we
conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models,
ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization
parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on
predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that
energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources,
i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially
between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced
by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed
light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can
inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ANN-to-SNN conversion methods struggle with nonlinear operations in Transformers and require fine-tuning, limiting efficiency.

Method: Introduces a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE) neuron for efficient approximation of nonlinear operations without modifying pre-trained ANN weights.

Result: Achieves near-lossless conversion accuracy with lower latency across tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and architectures (ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2).

Conclusion: Offers a scalable and efficient solution for deploying Spiking Transformers in real-world applications.

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a
promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures.
Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion
methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer
from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in
Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for
pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and
training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer
architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE)
neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding
method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the
requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments
across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures
(ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless
conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising
pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: A mutual information-based framework identifies and filters noisy or mislabeled data, improving model accuracy by up to 15% under label corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are sensitive to noisy labels and inputs, but real-world datasets often contain both. This work aims to improve data quality by selecting high-quality samples.

Method: The framework quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels using mutual information, identifying low-contribution samples as noisy or mislabeled.

Result: Empirical tests on MNIST show the method effectively filters low-quality data, boosting classification accuracy by up to 15% under label noise.

Conclusion: The proposed method robustly filters corrupted data while preserving valid samples, enhancing model performance in noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality
critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently
compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual
information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios
that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute
each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find
that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical
validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that
the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption,
training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\%
compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to
benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering
truly corrupted samples.

*Pietro Talli,Federico Mason,Federico Chiariotti,Andrea Zanella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HR3L is a novel architecture for training RL agents over lossy/delayed wireless networks, avoiding gradient exchange and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents struggle with partial/intermittent state updates over non-ideal wireless channels, needing efficient solutions.

Method: HR3L uses transmitter-receiver units to encode/decode environment representations without gradient exchange.

Result: HR3L outperforms baselines in sample efficiency and adapts to packet loss, delays, and capacity limits.

Conclusion: HR3L offers a lightweight, efficient solution for remote RL training over imperfect networks.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to
instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its
actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state
updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial
and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been
proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer
specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these
limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote
Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents
exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two
units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the
environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs
actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the
exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for
quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art
solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms
baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different
communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and
capacity limitations.

TL;DR: TRGE method addresses catastrophic and forward forgetting in MDCL by dynamically expanding CLIP, using expert groups, and leveraging MLLMs for task identification, outperforming others with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle catastrophic forgetting and forward forgetting in Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) with shifting class sets and distributions.

Method: Proposes TRGE: dynamically expands CLIP, assigns expert groups per task, uses intra-group routing, inter-group routing, and MLLMs for task identification. Fuses outputs for unseen samples.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters in various settings.

Conclusion: TRGE effectively mitigates forgetting issues in MDCL, enhancing inter-task collaboration and leveraging pre-trained and learned knowledge.

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential
tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual
heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward
forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped
Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the
pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows
in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and
introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by
the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing
policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically
selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task
collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal
comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize
the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we
dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE
adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned
knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method
outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

*Fengdi Che*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys theoretical insights in offline RL, highlighting conditions for solvability, inherent challenges, and practical implications for algorithm design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical algorithm design in offline RL by exploring key intuitions from theory.

Method: Examines conditions like function representation and data coverage, counterexamples of unsolvable cases, and sufficient conditions for offline RL.

Result: Identifies limitations and inherent hardness in offline RL, emphasizing the need for novel solutions when theoretical conditions aren't met.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights guide algorithm design but also reveal challenges, urging further research to address unmet conditions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed
dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the
environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant
theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental
challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with
practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we
explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for
offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function
representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation
conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage
assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine
counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically
large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all
algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to
mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for
offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,
but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to
search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

TL;DR: GRAO (Group Relative Alignment Optimization) is a unified framework combining SFT and RL strengths, improving alignment in language models with innovations like multi-sample generation and Group Direct Alignment Loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of SFT (offline policy constraints) and RL (low sample efficiency, dependency on high-quality base models) in language model alignment.

Method: Proposes GRAO with three innovations: multi-sample generation for reward feedback, Group Direct Alignment Loss, and reference-aware parameter updates.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (57.70%, 17.65%, 7.95%, 5.18%) over SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO baselines in alignment tasks.

Conclusion: GRAO offers a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework for efficient language model alignment.

Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing
language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning)
accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its
efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast,
RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but
suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality
base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative
Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective
strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample
generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward
feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging
intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates
guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes
GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over
conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human
alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving
57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and
GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded
alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution
in language models.

*Martin Rektoris,Milan Papež,Václav Šmídl,Tomáš Pevný*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Probabilistic Graph Circuits (SPGCs) are introduced to address the scalability issues of dense PGCs, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n + m) while retaining exact inference capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs are intractable due to non-linearities, and dense PGCs, while tractable, suffer from O(n²) complexity. SPGCs aim to solve this scalability problem.

Method: SPGCs operate directly on sparse graph representations, reducing complexity to O(n + m).

Result: SPGCs retain exact inference, improve memory efficiency and speed, and match intractable DGMs in performance for drug design.

Conclusion: SPGCs provide a scalable, tractable alternative to dense PGCs and intractable DGMs, particularly for sparse graphs.

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive
power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these
networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many
standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered
\emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)
address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they
operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for
graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,
we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that
operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the
context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain
exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed,
and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

*Qiang He,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAMA is a scalable algorithm for multi-objective alignment in LLMs, reducing complexity from O(n^2*d) to O(n) and enabling efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods like RLHF optimize LLMs for a single reward, failing to capture diverse human preferences, necessitating multi-objective alignment solutions.

Method: PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into convex optimization with a closed-form solution, reducing computational complexity.

Result: PAMA achieves efficient optimization (O(n) complexity) and converges to Pareto stationary points, validated on models up to 7B parameters.

Conclusion: PAMA offers a practical, scalable solution for aligning LLMs with diverse objectives, enhancing adaptability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,
objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus
creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,
optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that
fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This
limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making
multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge
this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and
computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In
contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)
methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a
closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO
approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the
number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering
direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is
the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within
milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto
stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least
one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B
parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning
with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to
the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a
practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse
human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI
deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN architecture effectively balances accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, with open-sourced code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular representation learning have produced highly

demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We
achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across
almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoCoT is a self-evolving curriculum learning framework for LLMs that improves reasoning by optimizing two-stage CoT reasoning, enabling stable learning from hard problems under sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving LLM reasoning face scalability issues or limit exploration due to sparse rewards on hard problems.

Method: EvoCoT uses self-generated and verified CoT trajectories, gradually shortening them to expand exploration space in a controlled manner.

Result: EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems and improves reasoning without external supervision, compatible with various RL methods.

Conclusion: EvoCoT offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing LLM reasoning under sparse rewards, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising
paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their
reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard
problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing
exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for
distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or
restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on
two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the
exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then
gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables
LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse
rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,
and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously
unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT
supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release
the source code to support future research.

TL;DR: Incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into spacecraft attitude control improves performance and stability over purely data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of purely data-driven models in generalization and stability for spacecraft attitude control.

Method: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with Real NVP architecture and self-attention, trained on Basilisk simulator data. Compare with purely data-driven approaches.

Result: PINN-based models reduce mean relative error by 27.08% and improve control accuracy and robustness by up to 42.86%.

Conclusion: Physics-informed learning enhances spacecraft attitude control, outperforming purely data-driven methods in MPC frameworks.

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the potential of participant simulators in behavioral sciences, focusing on Centaur, an LLM fine-tuned for human-like behavior. While Centaur shows predictive accuracy, it falls short in generative behavior, limiting its reliability as a simulator or cognitive model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate Centaur's suitability as a participant simulator in behavioral sciences, given its potential to revolutionize experimental prototyping like AlphaFold in chemistry.

Method: Review core criteria for participant simulators and assess Centaur's performance, particularly its predictive accuracy and generative behavior compared to human data.

Result: Centaur exhibits strong predictive accuracy but systematic divergence in generative behavior from human data.

Conclusion: Centaur is a step forward but does not yet meet the standards for a reliable participant simulator or accurate cognitive model.

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico
prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.

*Liang Hou,Yuan Gao,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Qi Yan,Renjie Liao,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScoreAug, a data augmentation framework for diffusion models to address overfitting in data-limited regimes by transforming noisy data and enforcing an equivariant learning objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in diffusion models, especially in data-limited scenarios, motivates the need for a specialized augmentation method like ScoreAug.

Method: ScoreAug applies transformations to noisy data, aligns with diffusion's denoising mechanism, and requires the denoiser to predict augmented targets, creating an equivariant learning objective.

Result: ScoreAug significantly improves performance on benchmarks (CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, ImageNet), mitigates overfitting, and avoids data leakage issues.

Conclusion: ScoreAug effectively addresses overfitting in diffusion models, works synergistically with traditional augmentation, and enhances model performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model
training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we
propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework
specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation
approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to
noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.
Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation
of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning
objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising
spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also
theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under
general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on
multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with
results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.
Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,
such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable
convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data
augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under
certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically
combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional
performance gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in non-stationary time series forecasting where patterns evolve over time.

Method: Offline training of a base DNN, clustering dominant patterns, fine-tuning specialized models per cluster, and deploying them via similarity matching. Includes concept drift detection for emerging patterns.

Result: Significant performance gains on traditional and advanced DNN architectures in GluonTS.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable and effective for non-stationary time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary
environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance
by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN
is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset
is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the
series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the
base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique
pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against
the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed
based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates
a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns
caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable
across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance
gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in
the GluonTS library.

*Richard J. Fawley,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHARK is a feature-weighted clustering algorithm using Shapley values to quantify feature relevance without extra parameters, outperforming existing methods in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering assumes equal feature contribution, which fails in high-dimensional or noisy data. Feature weighting methods often require tuning.

Method: SHARK uses Shapley values to decompose the k-means objective into per-feature contributions, iteratively re-weighting features by their Shapley relevance.

Result: SHARK matches or outperforms existing methods, showing robustness and accuracy, especially in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: SHARK provides a parameter-free, efficient, and effective solution for feature-weighted clustering, validated by synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the
data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy
settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require
additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a
feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values
from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no
additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means
objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing
an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley
computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights
features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative
dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms
existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in
scenarios where noise may be present. Software:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF frameworks face challenges in scaling and dynamic workload adaptation, especially for large models and complex workflows.

Method: Introduces WeChat-YATT with a parallel controller model and dynamic resource allocation to enhance scalability and efficiency.

Result: Achieves higher throughput and better GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, validated in real-world WeChat deployments.

Conclusion: WeChat-YATT effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges in RLHF training, proving robust in practical applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent
paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite
notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant
challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to
dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations
related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as
inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,
we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,
scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address
these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model
that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,
effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller
architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In
addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions
computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training
conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,
demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared
to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been
successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a
large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in
real-world applications.

*Hongxin Yu,Yibing Wang,Fengyue Jin,Meng Zhang,Anni Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) for real-time freeway traffic state estimation (TSE), outperforming baseline methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve TSE accuracy by combining model-driven and data-driven approaches, leveraging the strengths of both through a novel operator-oriented architecture.

Method: Extended PI-DeepONet architecture with 2-D data input, nonlinear expansion, attention mechanism, MIMO, and adaptive traffic flow model parameter identification.

Result: Outperformed baseline methods in flow and mean speed estimation on NGSIM and a Chinese expressway.

Conclusion: The extended PI-DeepONet is a promising approach for high-precision TSE, integrating physics and data effectively.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:
model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies
on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven
TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine
learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state
estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more
accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be
viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested
traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the
first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an
operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep
neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the
original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the
acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the
introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO
mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of
traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of
this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short
freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along
with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that
this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision
estimation results of flow and mean speed.

TL;DR: A learning-based framework combining traditional ML and graph neural networks is proposed for selecting algorithms for the Maximum Clique Problem, with RF as a strong baseline and GAT-MLP showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single algorithm performs best for all MCP instances, and there's a lack of research on algorithm selection for MCP.

Method: Constructed a labeled dataset using four exact MCP algorithms on diverse graphs, evaluated conventional classifiers (SVM, RF, DT, KNN), and developed GAT-MLP, a dual-channel model combining GAT and MLP.

Result: RF performed consistently well, while GAT-MLP outperformed across all metrics, highlighting the importance of connectivity and topology.

Conclusion: Dual-channel architectures and graph neural networks are effective for combinatorial algorithm selection.

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique
algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the
importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through
an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of
research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique
Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to
address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP
algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by
structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first
evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple
dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong
performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.
In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and
topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building
on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which
combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model
shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of
graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

*Mohamad Assaad,Zeinab Nehme,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two communication-efficient Federated Learning methods to reduce overhead by using scalar values and simultaneous user transmissions, leveraging channel information without extra CSI resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces high communication overhead due to data exchange between devices and aggregators, exceeding wireless system capacity.

Method: Two methods: zero-order optimization with two-point gradient estimator and first-order gradient computation, both leveraging channel information and supporting asynchronous devices.

Result: Rigorous analytical framework provided with convergence guarantees and performance bounds.

Conclusion: The methods effectively reduce communication overhead in FL while maintaining performance, leveraging channel information and accommodating asynchronous devices.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge
devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL
faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information
that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training
phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this
paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where
communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of
long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information
simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique
with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order
gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel
information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for
additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove
its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a
rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence
guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

TL;DR: A scalable data-driven method for power consumption prediction in ICE, EV, and HEV platforms achieves high accuracy, with transformer and LSTM models performing best for EVs and HEVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional power consumption prediction methods are impractical for large-scale deployment, necessitating a scalable, data-driven approach.

Method: Uses powertrain dynamic feature sets with traditional machine learning and deep neural networks (Transformer and LSTM) for prediction.

Result: ICE models achieved high accuracy (errors under 3%), while Transformer and LSTM models performed best for EVs and HEVs (errors below 4.1% and 2.1%).

Conclusion: The method is effective across vehicle types, but EV and HEV datasets show greater variability, highlighting the need for robust models.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized
instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale,
real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

*Maozhen Zhang,Mengnan Zhao,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadPromptFL is a backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal models, achieving high success rates without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning are unexplored, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed.

Method: Compromised clients optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into global aggregation.

Result: Achieves >90% attack success rates with minimal visibility and limited client participation.

Conclusion: Raises concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full
fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via
learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to
federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively
train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security
implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning
remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack
targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In
BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and
prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation
process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling
universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.
Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,
BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal
visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,
stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about
the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEMC to model the dynamic stability-plasticity balance in continual learning, showing it's non-stationary and diminishes with task distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning by characterizing the dynamic behavior of model capacity.

Method: Develop a difference equation to model NN, task data, and optimization interplay, and validate with experiments across architectures.

Result: Effective capacity is non-stationary; NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes with differing task distributions.

Conclusion: CLEMC provides insights into the inherent non-stationarity of stability-plasticity balance in continual learning.

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN)
capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual
learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity
(CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity
balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the
interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then
leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension,
the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show
that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability
to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from
previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical
findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and
convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and
transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

*Sven Weinzierl,Sandra Zilker,Annina Liessmann,Martin Käppel,Weixin Wang,Martin Matzner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning-based PPM technique enables organizations with limited event data to implement predictive process monitoring by leveraging knowledge from similar processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPM techniques require ample event data, which some organizations lack, hindering PPM adoption. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a transfer learning approach.

Method: The technique transfers knowledge from one business process to another, demonstrated in IT service management use cases with intra- and inter-organizational event logs.

Result: Experiments show that knowledge transfer enables effective PPM in target contexts, even with limited data.

Conclusion: The proposed technique allows organizations to benefit from transfer learning, facilitating PPM adoption across organizational boundaries.

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in
organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM)
transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that
provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime.
Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other
relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some
organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique
presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or
other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The
technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical
experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes
in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments
suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar
business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective
PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can
benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting,
where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across
organizational boundaries.

TL;DR: PMGraph is a benchmark for supply-chain graphs, and C-MAG is a two-stage multimodal architecture for link prediction, improving accuracy in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture complex supply-chain data like capabilities, certifications, and multimodal profiles, necessitating better solutions.

Method: C-MAG aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into group embeddings, then propagates them via multiscale message passing in a hetero-graph.

Result: The approach enhances link prediction accuracy and provides guidelines for modality-aware fusion in noisy settings.

Conclusion: PMGraph and C-MAG address gaps in supply-chain data representation and link prediction, offering practical improvements.

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable
manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply
chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities,
certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world
manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public
benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking
8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product
edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the
Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first
aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group
embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph
via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also
provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive
performance in noisy, real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A classifier-based approach speeds up logic optimization by pruning unsuccessful cuts, achieving a 3.9x speedup over ABC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of logic optimization operators, with conventional methods failing 98% of the time, necessitate more efficient solutions.

Method: Uses a classifier to preemptively prune unsuccessful cuts, avoiding unnecessary resynthesis operations.

Result: Achieves a 3.9x speedup in logic optimization compared to the state-of-the-art ABC implementation.

Conclusion: The classifier-based method significantly improves efficiency in logic optimization by reducing redundant computations.

Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial
role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation
demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts
for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often
fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost
through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to
prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis
operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite
and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup
logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of standardized guidelines and fragmented understanding of RL techniques in LLM reasoning, resolving inconsistencies in experimental setups and conclusions.

Method: Systematic review and rigorous reproduction of RL techniques within a unified open-source framework, analyzing mechanisms, scenarios, and principles through fine-grained experiments.

Result: A minimalist combination of two RL techniques outperforms existing methods like GRPO and DAPO, unlocking critic-free policy learning with vanilla PPO loss.

Conclusion: Provides clear guidelines for RL technique selection in LLM reasoning and demonstrates the effectiveness of a simple RL combination, offering a reliable roadmap for practitioners.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

*Cas Oude Hoekstra,Floris den Hengst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR) extends Symbolic Regression (SR) to predict conditional quantiles, offering interpretable models for non-average outcomes like medians or extremes, and performs comparably to black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SR methods focus on average outcomes, but understanding relationships at other distribution points (e.g., median, extremes) is crucial for high-stakes applications.

Method: SQR adapts SR to estimate conditional quantiles, evaluated against transparent and black-box models, and applied in an airline fuel usage case study.

Result: SQR outperforms transparent models and matches black-box performance while maintaining interpretability. It also explains feature influences across quantiles.

Conclusion: SQR is effective for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding feature impacts at different distribution points, suitable for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating
interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully
applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is
currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship
between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable.
Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture
of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in
high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces
Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional
quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms
transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline
without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain
differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme
and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR
is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting
feature influences at varying quantiles.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks three operator-learning surrogates for lithium-ion battery digital twins, proposing a new PE-FNO model that balances speed, accuracy, and parametric flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity, real-time digital twins for lithium-ion batteries, addressing the need for speed and accuracy in dynamic load scenarios.

Method: Benchmarked DeepONets, FNOs, and proposed PE-FNO on simulated battery trajectories under various current loads and SOC ranges.

Result: PE-FNO achieved high speed (200x faster than SPM solver) and accuracy (<1.7 mV error), with improved generalization for varying parameters.

Conclusion: PE-FNO offers a practical solution for real-time battery management and design, outperforming conventional methods in speed and flexibility.

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical
fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three
operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator
Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed
parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each
spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are
trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,
triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates
constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO
maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with
voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing
parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to
varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster
than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse
tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,
recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute
percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in
comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural
operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of
real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference.
PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path
towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Result: Effective in producing accurate, timely navigation guidance in various indoor scenarios.

Conclusion: A lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation.

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex

framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.
Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin

Result: 96% localization accuracy and 75% navigation instruction accuracy, with noted limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for scalable indoor navigation in resource-constrained settings like hospitals and airports.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable
GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments.
This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that
integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based
navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural
network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position
using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation
module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to
interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions.
Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with
repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The
model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested
waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration
queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an
average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot
reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for
scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and
publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings

TL;DR: The paper introduces memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model using a temporal variational autoencoder to simulate memory dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge tracing models often overlook personalized forgetting patterns and other memory processes (encoding, storage, retrieval), limiting performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes memoryKT, a three-stage model: (i) learning knowledge memory features, (ii) reconstructing exercise feedback, and (iii) embedding a personalized forgetting module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four public datasets.

Conclusion: memoryKT effectively models the encoding-storage-retrieval cycle, enhancing individual difference perception and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: NeuroDx-LM demonstrates significant potential for advancing EEG-based clinical applications.

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown
promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection.
However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces
critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance
in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel
large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological
disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency
Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral
patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy
that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage,
our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in
the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained
features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the
CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results
demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance
clinical applicability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: OFAL is an oracle-free active learning method that uses neural network uncertainty to transform confident unlabeled samples into uncertain ones, improving model accuracy without relying on an oracle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling data with an oracle is costly and complex, especially with large unlabeled datasets. The goal is to achieve better results without oracle dependency.

Method: OFAL separates and quantifies uncertainty using Monte Carlo Dropouts (approximating Bayesian Neural Networks) and a variational autoencoder to generate uncertain samples from confident ones.

Result: The method enhances model accuracy by generating informative uncertain samples for active learning.

Conclusion: OFAL compares and integrates with other active learning methods, offering a viable oracle-free alternative.

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always
been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled
data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results
without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free
active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the
model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into
informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying
different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an
approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a
variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping
toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed
sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active
learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and
integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of circuit design research and inconsistent data representation make literature review challenging. MuaLLM aims to streamline this process.

Method: MuaLLM integrates a hybrid RAG framework with an adaptive vector database, using ReAct for iterative reasoning and multimodal data processing.

Result: MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250 and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100, with 10x lower cost and 1.6x faster performance than standard LLMs.

Conclusion: MuaLLM offers a scalable, efficient solution for circuit design assistance, overcoming limitations of conventional LLMs and simulation-based datasets.

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive

automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.

### [521] [FairFLRep: Fairness aware fault localization and repair of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08151)
*Moses Openja,Paolo Arcaini,Foutse Khomh,Fuyuki Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairFLRep is an automated technique to identify and fix bias-inducing neurons in DNNs, improving fairness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs often reflect biases from training data, leading to unfair decisions. Addressing this bias efficiently is challenging.

Method: FairFLRep adjusts neuron weights linked to sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) by analyzing input-output relationships.

Result: FairFLRep outperforms existing methods in fairness improvement and efficiency, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FairFLRep effectively balances fairness and accuracy, proving its superiority over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our
daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact
individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used
during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and
inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates
between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently
identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper
introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair
technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN
classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with
sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair
decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network,
FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality
parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two
DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show
that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness
while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of
considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our
findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline
approaches in repairing the network.

*Cem Ata Baykara,Saurav Raj Pandey,Ali Burak Ünal,Harlin Lee,Mete Akgün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Federated Learning (FL) for epileptic seizure prediction using EEG data from diverse datasets, addressing privacy and data heterogeneity. It proposes Random Subset Aggregation to improve fairness and performance across sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate and generalizable seizure prediction models while respecting patient privacy and handling data heterogeneity across clinical sites.

Method: Uses FL with privacy-preserving global normalization and introduces Random Subset Aggregation, where clients train on fixed-size random subsets per round for balanced contributions.

Result: Random Subset Aggregation improves performance on underrepresented datasets (e.g., 81.7% accuracy on Helsinki) and achieves superior macro-average (77.1%) and pooled (80.0%) accuracy.

Conclusion: Balanced FL approaches like Random Subset Aggregation can build robust, fair, and generalizable seizure prediction systems in heterogeneous multi-hospital settings.

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models
from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is
hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity
(non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like
Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in
heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using
a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,
Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,
neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global
normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each
client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring
equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained
models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields
highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on
Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation
significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy
increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior
macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,
demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the
potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable
seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital
environments while respecting data privacy.

*Vincent Perreault,Katsumi Inoue,Richard Labib,Alain Hertz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Logic Networks are generalized with NOT operations and biases for interpretable logical and probabilistic modeling, improving Boolean network discovery and interpretability in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in traditional neural networks by developing a logical and probabilistic model that is inspectable and verifiable.

Method: Generalize Neural Logic Networks with NOT operations and biases, propose a factorized IF-THEN rule structure, and introduce a modified learning algorithm.

Result: The method improves state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and learns interpretable rules, demonstrated in medical classification tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances interpretability and performance in logical modeling, particularly valuable in fields like medicine where transparency is crucial.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance,
but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic
Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to
learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR
operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that
take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and
probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use.
We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well
as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in
Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules
in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where
interpretability has tangible value.

*Nicole Lai-Tan,Xiao Gu,Marios G. Philiastides,Fani Deligianni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ITSA is a novel pre-alignment strategy for BCIs to improve cross-subject generalization in music-based motor rehabilitation by addressing EEG variability and movement artefacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inter-subject variability in EEG signals and movement-induced artefacts, which hinder BCI generalizability in personalised music-based motor rehabilitation.

Method: Proposes ITSA with subject-specific recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment, combined with a hybrid RCSP and Riemannian geometry architecture.

Result: ITSA significantly improves performance across subjects and conditions, with parallel fusion outperforming sequential fusion.

Conclusion: ITSA enhances BCI generalizability for motor rehabilitation, offering robust performance across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

*Tong Yang,Yu Huang,Yingbin Liang,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers learn multi-step reasoning tasks, specifically path-finding in trees, through chain-of-thought processes. It analyzes backward and forward reasoning tasks, showing that one-layer transformers can solve them with generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which transformers acquire multi-step reasoning abilities, particularly in symbolic tasks like path-finding, and to provide theoretical insights into their training dynamics.

Method: The study focuses on two tasks: backward reasoning (outputting a path from goal to root) and forward reasoning (two-stage reasoning involving path identification and reversal). Theoretical analysis is grounded in gradient descent dynamics.

Result: Trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks, with attention heads specializing and coordinating autonomously. The findings generalize to unseen trees.

Conclusion: Shallow transformers can solve complex reasoning tasks when structured with intermediate chain-of-thought steps, offering insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities without deeper architectures.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step
reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which
they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from
a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to
solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought
processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:
a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to
the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements
two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then
reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,
grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer
transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to
unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward
reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and
coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive
path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained
transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they
offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when
tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow
multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise
require deeper architectures.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM-based IDN architectures in 6G RAN, proposing a hierarchical GenAI-driven framework for intent processing, validation, and execution, outperforming conventional IDNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing heterogeneity and dynamism of 6G networks require advanced automation, addressed by IDNs. LLMs and GenAI can enhance this by enabling adaptive, intelligent automation.

Method: A hierarchical learning-enabled IDN architecture integrating GenAI across intent processing, validation, and execution stages, demonstrated via a case study using the Mamba GenAI architecture.

Result: The proposed GenAI-driven IDN architecture enhances network performance, surpassing conventional IDN architectures.

Conclusion: The hierarchical GenAI integration in IDNs offers superior performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs and GenAI in 6G network automation.

Abstract: With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly
heterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient
management. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating
high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions to enable
adaptive, intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI
(GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated
Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This
article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a hierarchical
learning-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key
stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. Unlike most
existing approaches that apply GenAI in the form of LLMs for intent processing
only, we propose a hierarchical framework that introduces GenAI across all
three stages of IDN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDN
management architecture, we present a case study based on the latest GenAI
architecture named Mamba. The case study shows how the proposed GenAI-driven
architecture enhances network performance through intelligent automation,
surpassing the performance of the conventional IDN architectures.

*Myeung Suk Oh,Zhiyao Zhang,FNU Hairi,Alvaro Velasquez,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A decentralized MARL approach improves random access MAC protocol performance by minimizing collisions and ensuring fairness, with lower communication overhead and proven convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized MARL methods for RA MAC protocols are impractical due to high overhead and reliance on centralized training.

Method: Fully decentralized MARL with consensus-based information exchange, using an actor-critic network and local reward sharing.

Result: Significant performance improvement in RA networks compared to baselines, with theoretical convergence proof.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized MARL is effective and practical for RA MAC protocol optimization.

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for
seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control
(MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data
traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an
effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission
fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE)
have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized
training and the significant overhead required for information collection can
make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully
decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on
centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across
devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and
propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our
approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can
significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how environmental factors influence customer satisfaction in urban dining settings, considering car dependency.

Method: Used computer vision on review and street view images to measure safety/visual appeal, then ordinal logistic regression on Yelp ratings.

Result: Indoor/outdoor aesthetics significantly affect ratings, but streetscape quality matters less in car-dependent areas.

Conclusion: Context-sensitive planning integrating indoor/outdoor factors is key for improving customer experiences across diverse urban settings.

Abstract: This study examines how indoor and outdoor aesthetics, streetscapes, and
neighborhood features shape customer satisfaction at eating and dining

*Chaoqun Cui,Caiyan Jia*

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGCL, a graph contrastive learning method for rumor detection, addressing the wide-structure nature of rumor propagation trees (RPTs) with adaptive augmentation based on node centrality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models assume deep RPT structures, but real-world data shows most nodes are shallow. This gap motivates a method focusing on intensive substructures.

Method: Proposes RAGCL with adaptive view augmentation (node dropping, attribute masking, edge dropping) guided by centrality scores and three principles for RPT augmentation.

Result: RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, demonstrating robust rumor representation learning.

Conclusion: The work reveals RPTs' wide-structure nature and offers a principled, adaptive graph contrastive learning approach, potentially benefiting other tree-structured graph applications.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most
existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep
structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However,
through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide
structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on
intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning
(RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We
summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2)
retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We
employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities
from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive
objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective
graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through
principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation
techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured
graphs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the imbalance in rumor detection by proposing AD-GSCL, a framework using anomaly detection and graph contrastive learning, validated on large-scale Weibo and Twitter datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world social media data is imbalanced, with rumors being rare. Existing methods treat it as balanced, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Constructs large datasets from Weibo and Twitter, analyzes domain distributions, and proposes AD-GSCL, a graph contrastive learning framework for anomaly detection.

Result: AD-GSCL outperforms under balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions, showing effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights for handling imbalanced data in rumor detection, improving real-world applicability.

Abstract: Current rumor detection methods based on propagation structure learning
predominately treat rumor detection as a class-balanced classification task on
limited labeled data. However, real-world social media data exhibits an
imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts.
To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale
conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain
distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor
distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors
concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly
detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework
with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats
unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor
detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under
class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide
valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data
distributions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, revealing fine-tuning lineages and using evolutionary biology to study genetic similarity and mutation in ML models. It finds family resemblances, fast mutations, and insights into license drift, language compatibility, and model card standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically examine the structure of interactions in generative ML/AI model development, particularly fine-tuning lineages, which lack extensive study.

Method: Analysis of 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, using model metadata and cards to measure genetic similarity and mutation traits, framed through an evolutionary biology lens.

Result: Models show family resemblance but deviate from asexual reproduction norms, with fast, directed mutations. Insights include license drift toward permissive terms, shift to English-only compatibility, and standardized model cards.

Conclusion: The study advances empirical understanding of model fine-tuning and demonstrates ecological models' potential for novel scientific insights in ML.

Abstract: Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive
pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific
downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the
structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on
Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our
study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their
base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in
size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we
use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and
mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a
family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more
overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities
depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because
mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit
more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional
drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine
learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive,
commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation
of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility
towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and
standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated
text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded
understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and
methods can yield novel scientific insights.

TL;DR: CNL-P combines prompt engineering and software engineering principles to create structured, precise prompts for LLMs, improving output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguity in natural language prompts and enhance LLM performance by integrating structured, declarative expressions.

Method: Introduces CNL-P with precise grammar and semantic norms, an NL2CNL-P conversion tool, and a linting tool for syntactic/semantic checks.

Result: CNL-P improves LLM response quality by reducing ambiguity and enabling structured intent expression.

Conclusion: CNL-P bridges prompt engineering and software engineering, paving the way for a new NL-centric programming paradigm.

Abstract: With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are
increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code
generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the
``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices
for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines
and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),
which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles
from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and
strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a
declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps
LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and
higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on
LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into
CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we
develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic
accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM
responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that
CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the
foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.

TL;DR: CODE2BENCH is a pipeline for creating contamination-resistant benchmarks from GitHub repos to rigorously evaluate LLMs on real-world code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs suffer from data contamination and limited rigor, failing to effectively reveal model weaknesses.

Method: CODE2BENCH uses automated dynamism, scope graph-based dependency analysis, and property-based testing to construct benchmarks.

Result: The benchmark (CODE2BENCH-2505) shows LLMs struggle with complex, cross-language tasks but perform better on Python-specific tasks.

Conclusion: CODE2BENCH provides a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic method for dynamic benchmark construction, improving LLM evaluation.

Abstract: As large language models LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, rigorously evaluating their performance on complex,
real-world code generation tasks has become essential. However, existing
benchmarks often suffer from data contamination and limited test rigor,
constraining their ability to reveal model failures effectively. To address
these, we present CODE2BENCH, a end-to-end pipeline for dynamically
constructing robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks from real-world
GitHub repositories. Specifically, CODE2BENCH introduces three key innovations:
(1) Automated Dynamism, achieved through periodic ingestion of recent code to
minimize training data contamination; (2) Scope Graph-based dependency
analysis, which enables structured classification of functions into benchmark
instances with controlled dependency levels (distinguishing between
Self-Contained (SC) tasks for cross-language evaluation and Weakly
Self-Contained (WSC) tasks involving permitted library usage); and (3)
Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the automated synthesis of rigorous test
suites to enable thorough functional verification. Using this pipeline, we
construct CODE2BENCH-2505, the first benchmark derived from 880 recent Python
projects spanning diverse domains, comprising 1,163 code generation tasks with
100% average branch coverage on ground-truth implementations. Extensive
evaluation of 16 LLMs using CODE2BENCH-2505 reveals that models consistently
struggle with SC tasks requiring complex, non-standard logic and cross-language
transfer, while showing relatively stronger performance on WSC tasks in Python.
Our work introduces a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic methodology
for dynamic benchmark construction, offering a principled foundation for the
comprehensive and realistic evaluation of LLMs on real-world software
development tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Mo2oM is a framework for extracting microservices from monolithic systems using soft clustering, improving modularity and reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hard clustering methods for microservice extraction increase coupling and reduce cohesion, prompting the need for a more flexible approach.

Method: Mo2oM uses deep semantic embeddings and structural dependencies with a graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm.

Result: Mo2oM improves structural modularity by up to 40.97%, reduces communication overhead by 58%, and enhances service size balance by 38.96%.

Conclusion: Mo2oM effectively addresses limitations of hard clustering, offering a scalable and maintainable solution for microservice extraction.

Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic
architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and
deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely
on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice.
This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service
cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a
framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem,
allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This
approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners
intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce
communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural
dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and
architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering
algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on
four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight
state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves
improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and
coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead),
26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in
non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.

### [536] [Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of AI-assisted Codebase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07966)
*Philipp Eibl,Sadra Sabouri,Souti Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the interaction between developers and codebase AI assistants (CBAs), identifying challenges and barriers to adoption, and suggests design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers interact with CBAs and why they fall short of developers' needs, given their limited adoption despite potential benefits.

Method: A counterbalanced user study and interviews with 16 students and developers, analyzing prompts, satisfaction, and challenges.

Result: Low satisfaction (mean=2.8/5) due to functionality issues (77%), poor code quality (42%), and communication problems (25%). Six challenges and five barriers to adoption were identified.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for design improvements in CBAs to address developer challenges and enhance usability.

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to
process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual
description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase
AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to
focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has
extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class
of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial
anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently
adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we
need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall
short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a
counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers
working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the
information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),
required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and
their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall
satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =
3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most
common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code
quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We
delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying
challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers
to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial
CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present
design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

### [537] [PyVeritas: On Verifying Python via LLM-Based Transpilation and Bounded Model Checking for C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08171)
*Pedro Orvalho,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PyVeritas is a framework using LLMs to transpile Python to C for formal verification and fault localization, achieving 80-90% accuracy in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python lacks robust formal verification tools compared to languages like C, and existing transpilers are too verbose or low-level.

Method: PyVeritas uses LLMs for high-level Python-to-C transpilation, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localization in C.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows 80-90% accuracy in transpilation, enabling verification and fault diagnosis for small Python programs.

Conclusion: PyVeritas bridges the gap in Python formal verification by leveraging existing C tools through LLM-based transpilation.

Abstract: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet
it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working
in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,
which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent
complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of
existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the
applicability of formal verification to Python programs.
  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed
by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated
C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code
using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two
Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high
degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development
environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault
diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

TL;DR: A lightweight face quality assessment network (MSPT) with Multi-Stage Progressive Training achieves high performance with efficient inference, addressing limitations of traditional and learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quality assessment methods struggle with face images, and learning-based approaches are computationally expensive, limiting practical use.

Method: Proposes a three-stage progressive training strategy introducing diverse data samples and increasing resolution to learn complex features efficiently.

Result: Achieved second highest score on VQualA 2025 benchmark, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods with efficient inference.

Conclusion: MSPT offers a lightweight, high-performance solution for face image quality assessment, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the perceptual quality of face images is crucial,
especially with the rapid progress in face restoration and generation.
Traditional quality assessment methods often struggle with the unique
characteristics of face images, limiting their generalizability. While
learning-based approaches demonstrate superior performance due to their strong
fitting capabilities, their high complexity typically incurs significant
computational and storage costs, hindering practical deployment. To address
this, we propose a lightweight face quality assessment network with Multi-Stage
Progressive Training (MSPT). Our network employs a three-stage progressive
training strategy that gradually introduces more diverse data samples and
increases input image resolution. This novel approach enables lightweight
networks to achieve high performance by effectively learning complex quality
features while significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our MSPT
achieved the second highest score on the VQualA 2025 face image quality
assessment benchmark dataset, demonstrating that MSPT achieves comparable or
better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficient
inference.

*Junxiao Xue,Xiaozhen Liu,Xuecheng Wu,Xinyi Yin,Danlei Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: AD-AVSR introduces bidirectional modality enhancement for AVSR, improving performance and noise robustness by capturing heterogeneous correlations between audio-visual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVSR methods lack effective handling of asymmetric information and heterogeneous correlations, limiting performance in noisy environments.

Method: Proposes AD-AVSR with bidirectional enhancement: Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module and Cross-modal Noise Suppression Masking Module, supported by a threshold-based selection mechanism.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on LRS2 and LRS3 datasets, demonstrating superior performance and noise robustness.

Conclusion: AD-AVSR's bidirectional approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, enhancing AVSR performance in noisy conditions.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) combines audio-visual modalities to
improve speech recognition, especially in noisy environments. However, most
existing methods deploy the unidirectional enhancement or symmetric fusion
manner, which limits their capability to capture heterogeneous and
complementary correlations of audio-visual data-especially under asymmetric
information conditions. To tackle these gaps, we introduce a new AVSR framework
termed AD-AVSR based on bidirectional modality enhancement. Specifically, we
first introduce the audio dual-stream encoding strategy to enrich audio
representations from multiple perspectives and intentionally establish
asymmetry to support subsequent cross-modal interactions. The enhancement
process involves two key components, Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module for
enhanced visual representations under audio guidance, and Cross-modal Noise
Suppression Masking Module which refines audio representations using visual
cues, collaboratively leading to the closed-loop and bidirectional information
flow. To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based
selection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual
pairs. Extensive experimental results on the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets indicate
that our AD-AVSR consistently surpasses SOTA methods in both performance and
noise robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of our model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like VGGSounder have flaws (incomplete labels, overlapping classes, misaligned modalities) that distort evaluations of audio-visual models.

Method: Introduces VGGSounder, a re-annotated multi-label test set with detailed modality annotations and a new modality confusion metric to analyze performance degradation.

Result: VGGSounder enables precise evaluation of modality-specific performance and reveals model limitations through the new metric.

Conclusion: VGGSounder improves reliability in assessing audio-visual foundation models by addressing prior dataset flaws and introducing new evaluation tools.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of
reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSounder dataset is
commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.
However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSounder, including
incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.
These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively
re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically
designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features
detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific
performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance
degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion
metric.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper investigates Presburger Functional Synthesis (PFnS), showing it can be solved in EXPTIME with matching lower bounds, unlike Boolean functional synthesis. It introduces PSyNF, a normal form enabling poly-time solvability, and explores its properties and alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the functional synthesis problem for Presburger Arithmetic, extending prior work in Boolean and first-order logic synthesis.

Method: Analyzes PFnS complexity, introduces PSyNF normal form, and explores its properties, checking, and compilation.

Result: PFnS is EXPTIME-complete; PSyNF enables poly-time solvability and is shown to be optimal in certain cases.

Conclusion: PSyNF provides a practical solution for PFnS, with theoretical guarantees, while simpler syntactic forms are less efficient.

Abstract: Given a relational specification between inputs and outputs as a logic
formula, the problem of functional synthesis is to automatically synthesize a
function from inputs to outputs satisfying the relation. Recently, a rich line
of work has emerged tackling this problem for specifications in different
theories, from Boolean to general first-order logic. In this paper, we launch
an investigation of this problem for the theory of Presburger Arithmetic, that
we call Presburger Functional Synthesis (PFnS). We show that PFnS can be solved
in EXPTIME and provide a matching exponential lower bound. This is unlike the
case for Boolean functional synthesis (BFnS), where only conditional
exponential lower bounds are known. Further, we show that PFnS for one input
and one output variable is as hard as BFnS in general. We then identify a
special normal form, called PSyNF, for the specification formula that
guarantees poly-time and poly-size solvability of PFnS. We prove several
properties of PSyNF, including how to check and compile to this form, and
conditions under which any other form that guarantees poly-time solvability of
PFnS can be compiled in poly-time to PSyNF. Finally, we identify a syntactic
normal form that is easier to check but is exponentially less succinct than
PSyNF.

### [542] [From Knowledge to Conjectures: A Modal Framework for Reasoning about Hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07304)
*Fabio Vitali*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: A new family of cognitive modal logics formalizes conjectural reasoning, preserving facts across hypothetical layers using Axiom C, avoiding modal collapse by excluding Axiom T and adopting paracomplete semantics. Systems like KC and KDC are complete, decidable, and robust under partial knowledge, with a dynamic operation for transitioning conjectures to facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize conjectural reasoning, distinguishing between factual and hypothetical statements while preserving established facts across cognitive contexts.

Method: Introduces Axiom C, avoids Axiom T, and adopts paracomplete semantics (Weak Kleene or Description Logic). Defines systems like KC and KDC and proves their properties.

Result: Systems are complete, decidable, and robust under partial knowledge. A dynamic operation formalizes transitions from conjecture to fact.

Conclusion: The framework successfully models conjectural reasoning without modal collapse, offering a robust and dynamic approach to cognitive modal logics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of cognitive modal logics designed to
formalize conjectural reasoning: a modal system in which cognitive contexts
extend known facts with hypothetical assumptions to explore their consequences.
Unlike traditional doxastic and epistemic systems, conjectural logics rely on a
principle, called Axiom C ($\varphi \rightarrow \Box\varphi$), that ensures
that all established facts are preserved across hypothetical layers. While
Axiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse,
we show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions,
and specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a
paracomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description
Logic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions. This
prevents the modal collapse and guarantees a layering to distinguish between
factual and conjectural statements. Under this framework we define new modal
systems, e.g., KC and KDC, and show that they are complete, decidable, and
robust under partial knowledge. Finally, we introduce a dynamic operation,
$\mathsf{settle}(\varphi)$, which formalizes the transition from conjecture to
accepted fact, capturing the event of the update of a world's cognitive state
through the resolution of uncertainty.

TL;DR: A rule-based framework for specifying and computing priority relations between conflicting facts in inconsistent KBs, addressing preference cycles and implementing an end-to-end system for querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods for specifying priority relations between facts in inconsistent KBs, which is crucial for optimal repairs.

Method: Introduces a declarative rule-based framework, explores cycle removal techniques, and implements an answer set programming system for querying.

Result: Presents a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the framework, demonstrating its feasibility.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for specifying preferences and querying inconsistent KBs under prioritized-repair semantics.

Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining
meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs).
While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between
facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such
preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a
declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority
relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain
undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of
preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a
pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle
removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs,
we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the
framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference
rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority
relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that balances safety and optimality in robotics path planning, validated through simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path planning algorithms often focus on either optimality or safety, but rarely both. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: UPP uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function, with tunable parameters to adjust safety levels and computational complexity.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests (e.g., TurtleBot) show UPP successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: UPP effectively balances safety and optimality, offering a flexible solution for robotics path planning.

Abstract: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a
wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized
assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant
challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite
advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most
path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little
research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP)
that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance
safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable
parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the
planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects
results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning
algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot,
where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.

Result: The platform facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, flexible 3D modeling, and human-in-the-loop capabilities for assessing human-machine trust.

Conclusion: MetAdv provides a scalable, unified framework for adversarial assessment, advancing safer autonomous driving.

Abstract: Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD)
systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a
novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and
interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical
vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical
sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment
with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates
end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial
generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level
execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum
of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines,
end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle
modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments,
with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla.
A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible
environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables
real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from
drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial
conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for
adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.

Motivation: Ensuring AV safety in critical scenarios requires efficient testing methods, as current approaches are inadequate.

Method: Extracted logical scenarios from real-world crashes, integrated Baidu Apollo for control, and proposed ALVNS-SA for accelerated testing.

Result: ALVNS-SA achieved 84.00% coverage in safety-critical scenarios, outperforming GA, ALNS-SA, and random testing.

Conclusion: ALVNS-SA significantly enhances testing efficiency and coverage, proving effective for AV safety validation.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount in their
development and deployment. Safety-critical scenarios pose more severe
challenges, necessitating efficient testing methods to validate AVs safety.
This study focuses on designing an accelerated testing algorithm for AVs in
safety-critical scenarios, enabling swift recognition of their driving
capabilities. First, typical logical scenarios were extracted from real-world
crashes in the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA)
database, obtaining pre-crash features through reconstruction. Second, Baidu
Apollo, an advanced black-box automated driving system (ADS) is integrated to
control the behavior of the ego vehicle. Third, we proposed an adaptive

expedite the testing process. Experimental results demonstrate a significant
enhancement in testing efficiency when utilizing ALVNS-SA. It achieves an
84.00% coverage of safety-critical scenarios, with crash scenario coverage of
96.83% and near-crash scenario coverage of 92.07%. Compared to genetic

### [548] [Learning Causal Structure Distributions for Robust Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06742)
*Alejandro Murillo-Gonzalez,Junhong Xu,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learning functional relationships in robotic systems while accounting for structural uncertainty improves model robustness and planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness and efficiency in robotic dynamics modeling by integrating structural causal models and addressing uncertainty.

Method: Estimates a causal structure distribution to sample causal graphs, used in an encoder-multidecoder probabilistic model for learning dynamics.

Result: Achieves more robust dynamics models, improves downstream planning, and adapts well to corrupted inputs and environmental changes.

Conclusion: The method outperforms traditional model-learning approaches by leveraging causal structure and sparsity, validated in simulations and real-world robotics.

Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system
interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the
relationships that are present in the system. The structural information
outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional
information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned
models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while
accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more
robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using
significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common
model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage
the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating
a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that
inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder
probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics
of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform
new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new
requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile
robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the
learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and
changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world
robotics scenarios. Video: https://youtu.be/X6k5t7OOnNc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments is a challenge for autonomous robots, requiring better trajectory prediction and control.

Method: The study integrates a deep learning-based SI predictor with MPC on a physical robot, comparing it to a Constant Velocity (CV) model in open-loop and closed-loop scenarios.

Result: SI reduces trajectory prediction errors by up to 76% in low-density settings and improves safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Real-world tests show discrepancies between open-loop and closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: The SI-MPC framework shows promise for safer, adaptive navigation in dynamic human-populated environments, emphasizing the need for system-level evaluation.

Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for
autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based
Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested
across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a
traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and
closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction -
reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and
motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals
discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI
model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the
importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's
promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated
environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an evolutionary game-theoretic framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to improve highway on-ramp merging by balancing efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and main-road vehicles (MVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decision-making algorithms for AVs fail to handle dynamic complexities and social acceptance, leading to unsafe or inefficient merging.

Method: An evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) framework is introduced, using a multi-objective payoff function and solving the replicator dynamic equation for optimal cut-in timing. A real-time driving style estimation algorithm adjusts the payoff function.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs.

Conclusion: The proposed EGT approach effectively addresses the challenges of highway on-ramp merging for AVs, balancing human-like preferences and real-time adaptability.

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging is of great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
since they have to proactively interact with surrounding vehicles to enter the
main road safely within limited time. However, existing decision-making
algorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social
acceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To
address this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging
decision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human
drivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road
vehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT
problem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving
preferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily
stable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing
efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style
estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by
observing the immediate reactions of MVs. Empirical results demonstrate that we
improve the efficiency, comfort and safety of both AVs and MVs compared with
existing game-theoretic and traditional planning approaches across multi-object
metrics.

*Xiaobei Zhao,Xingqi Lyu,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the A2A benchmark for agricultural VLN and proposes AgriVLN, a baseline method with a subtask decomposition module to improve navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural robots lack mobility and adaptability due to reliance on manual operation or fixed railways. Existing VLN benchmarks and methods are not tailored for agricultural scenes.

Method: Proposes the A2A benchmark with 1,560 episodes across six agricultural scenes. Introduces AgriVLN, a VLM-based method with a Subtask List (STL) module for instruction decomposition.

Result: AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles with long ones. The STL module improves Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47.

Conclusion: AgriVLN achieves state-of-the-art performance in agricultural VLN, addressing the gap in existing methods for agricultural navigation.

Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks,
nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway
for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability.
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target
destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong
performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or
methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap,
we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560
episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB
videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of
0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we
propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN)
baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted
templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural
environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When
evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles
with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the
instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose
Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into
AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare
AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art
performance in the agricultural domain.

*Mehrshad Zandigohar,Mallesham Dasari,Gunar Schirner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grasp-LLaVA and Hybrid Grasp Network (HGN) to improve prosthetic hand control by enhancing generalization to unseen objects and balancing latency-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prosthetic hand control models lack robustness and generalizability to unseen objects, limiting user independence.

Method: Proposes Grasp-LLaVA for human-like reasoning on grasp types and HGN for edge-cloud deployment to optimize latency and accuracy.

Result: Grasp-LLaVA achieves 50.2% accuracy on unseen objects (vs. 36.7% SOTA), and HGN improves accuracy by 5.6% with 3.5x speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance prosthetic hand control, improving accuracy and speed for real-world usability.

Abstract: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the
capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation
prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings
in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new
environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing
datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered
in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,
negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to
generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,
despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose
Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to
infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical
characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object
types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp
Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp
estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively
expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)
enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic
projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object
types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2%
gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.

### [554] [Vibration-Based Energy Metric for Restoring Needle Alignment in Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06921)
*Zhongyu Chen,Chenyang Li,Xuesong Li,Dianye Huang,Zhongliang Jiang,Stefanie Speidel,Xiangyu Chu,K. W. Samuel Au*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vibration-based method for restoring needle alignment in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures, effective even when the needle is out of plane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like speckle noise and low image resolution make needle detection difficult in ultrasound-guided procedures, especially when visibility is lost.

Method: Uses periodic needle vibration to create a robust energy metric, enabling control of ultrasound probe repositioning for alignment.

Result: Achieves translational error of 0.41±0.27 mm and rotational error of 0.51±0.19 degrees in ex-vivo tests.

Conclusion: The proposed vibration-based method effectively restores needle alignment without relying on needle visibility.

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in
robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as
speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust
needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In
this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound
imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many
existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound
images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the
needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based
energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of
plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the
ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the
needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted
on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided
needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and
the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Motivation: To address the safety and reliability of BEV perception in complex real-world scenarios like occlusions, adverse weather, and dynamic traffic.

Method: Systematic review of state-of-the-art BEV frameworks across three stages: single-modality, multimodal, and multi-agent collaborative perception. Analysis of public datasets for safety relevance.

Result: Identified key challenges (e.g., open-set recognition, sensor degradation) and outlined future directions (e.g., integration with end-to-end systems, large language models).

Conclusion: BEV perception is foundational for autonomous driving but faces critical safety challenges; future work should focus on robustness and integration with advanced AI systems.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has become a foundational paradigm in
autonomous driving, enabling unified spatial representations that support
robust multi-sensor fusion and multi-agent collaboration. As autonomous
vehicles transition from controlled environments to real-world deployment,
ensuring the safety and reliability of BEV perception in complex scenarios -
such as occlusions, adverse weather, and dynamic traffic - remains a critical
challenge. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of BEV
perception from a safety-critical perspective, systematically analyzing
state-of-the-art frameworks and implementation strategies across three
progressive stages: single-modality vehicle-side, multimodal vehicle-side, and
multi-agent collaborative perception. Furthermore, we examine public datasets
encompassing vehicle-side, roadside, and collaborative settings, evaluating
their relevance to safety and robustness. We also identify key open-world
challenges - including open-set recognition, large-scale unlabeled data, sensor
degradation, and inter-agent communication latency - and outline future
research directions, such as integration with end-to-end autonomous driving
systems, embodied intelligence, and large language models.

Result: Achieved mAP50 of 0.6 for object detection, MAE of 7.2 cm for depth estimation, 16 safety breaches in 42 trials, and <1s latency.

Conclusion: The system effectively complements drone autonomy in GPS-denied confined spaces with high performance and low latency.

Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous
quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework
leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and
incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor
data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system
integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth
estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for
context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by
calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded
architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is
facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental
results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object
detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42
trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1
second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an
auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art
drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ODYSSEY is a unified mobile manipulation framework for quadruped robots, integrating task planning and whole-body control to address challenges in language-guided long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current mobile manipulation, such as confined tabletop scenarios, insufficient generalization, and lack of study on maneuverability and precise control in unstructured settings.

Method: ODYSSEY uses a hierarchical planner with a vision-language model for task decomposition and a novel whole-body policy for robust control. It includes a benchmark for long-horizon mobile manipulation.

Result: The framework demonstrates successful sim-to-real transfer, generalization, and robustness in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: ODYSSEY advances the feasibility of generalized robotic assistants for complex, dynamic tasks in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand
challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and
adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,
although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task
planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to
tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited
actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies
exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object
configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for
practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform
maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings
remains understudied.
  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for
agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates
high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the
challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce
a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling
long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the
control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across
challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon
mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through
successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and
robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged
manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of
generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project

### [558] [DETACH: Cross-domain Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks via Mixture of Disentangled Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07842)
*Yutong Shen,Hangxu Liu,Penghui Liu,Ruizhe Xia,Tianyi Yao,Yitong Sun,Tongtong Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DETACH is a cross-domain learning framework for Long-Horizon tasks in Human-Scene Interaction, using dual-stream disentanglement inspired by the brain's 'where-what' pathways. It improves success rates and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LH tasks rely on skill chaining and lack generalization to new environments and skills, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DETACH uses two modules: an environment learning module for spatial understanding and a skill learning module for task execution, both disentangled for cross-domain transfer.

Result: DETACH improves subtask success rates by 23% and execution efficiency by 29% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DETACH's biologically inspired dual-stream approach effectively addresses the limitations of current methods for LH tasks in HSI.

Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex
multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,
and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,
existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained
subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking
the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,
failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,
this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via
biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's
"where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an
environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object
functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain
transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill
learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information
including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill
transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive
experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,
DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and
average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.

*Ganesh Sundaram,Jonas Ulmen,Amjad Haider,Daniel Görges*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model compression method for neural network controllers (NNCs) balances compression and stability, validated on TD-MPC with Lyapunov guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational complexity.

Method: Component-aware structured pruning to determine optimal pruning magnitude, integrated with Lyapunov stability criteria.

Result: Reduces model complexity while maintaining control performance and stability, with defined safe compression ratios.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for stable NNC compression, enabling confident deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile
robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the
demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can
operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs)
demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial
computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers
to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive
model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning
to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a
balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is
rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC),
a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a
systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties,
specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in
providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of
model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental
validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model
complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability
characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary
for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine
the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability
properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in
resource-limited environments.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network (GSG) combines spiking dynamics with Riemannian manifolds for improved graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spiking GNNs are limited by Euclidean space and fixed geometric assumptions, hindering their ability to model complex graph structures like hierarchies and cycles.

Method: GSG includes a Riemannian Embedding Layer, Manifold Spiking Layer, and Manifold Learning Objective, trained with Riemannian SGD.

Result: GSG outperforms Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs in accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: GSG introduces a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high
energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing
spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed
geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph
structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that
unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on
Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian
Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature
manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that
models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via
geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a
Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation
through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined
over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD,
eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and
energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs,
establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph
learning.

Conclusion: DGCA lays the foundation for developing plastic reservoirs and modeling adaptive morphogenesis.

Abstract: Developmental Graph Cellular Automata (DGCA) are a novel model for
morphogenesis, capable of growing directed graphs from single-node seeds. In
this paper, we show that DGCAs can be trained to grow reservoirs. Reservoirs
are grown with two types of targets: task-driven (using the NARMA family of
tasks) and task-independent (using reservoir metrics).
  Results show that DGCAs are able to grow into a variety of specialized,
life-like structures capable of effectively solving benchmark tasks,
statistically outperforming `typical' reservoirs on the same task. Overall,

TL;DR: Maestro-EVC is a controllable emotional voice conversion framework that independently manages content, speaker identity, and emotion, addressing disentanglement and fine-grained emotional expression challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EVC methods struggle with disentangling speaker identity and emotion, and lack fine-grained emotional expression modeling.

Method: Proposes Maestro-EVC with temporal emotion representation and explicit prosody modeling, using prosody augmentation for robust emotion transfer.

Result: Achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech synthesis.

Conclusion: Maestro-EVC effectively disentangles and controls speech attributes, improving emotional expressiveness and controllability.

Abstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional style of speech
while preserving its linguistic content. In practical EVC, controllability, the
ability to independently control speaker identity and emotional style using
distinct references, is crucial. However, existing methods often struggle to
fully disentangle these attributes and lack the ability to model fine-grained
emotional expressions such as temporal dynamics. We propose Maestro-EVC, a
controllable EVC framework that enables independent control of content, speaker
identity, and emotion by effectively disentangling each attribute from separate
references. We further introduce a temporal emotion representation and an
explicit prosody modeling with prosody augmentation to robustly capture and
transfer the temporal dynamics of the target emotion, even under
prosody-mismatched conditions. Experimental results confirm that Maestro-EVC
achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for guitar strumming transcription are limited by small datasets, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: A CRNN model is trained on a hybrid dataset (90 min of real-world recordings and 4h of synthetic audio) to detect strumming events, classify directions, and identify chords.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms baseline onset detection algorithms, achieving high accuracy in strumming action detection and chord classification.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for robust guitar strumming transcription, enabling new possibilities for automatic rhythm guitar analysis.

Abstract: Automatic transcription of guitar strumming is an underrepresented and
challenging task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), particularly for
extracting both strumming directions and chord progressions from audio signals.
While existing methods show promise, their effectiveness is often hindered by
limited datasets. In this work, we extend a multimodal approach to guitar
strumming transcription by introducing a novel dataset and a deep
learning-based transcription model. We collect 90 min of real-world guitar
recordings using an ESP32 smartwatch motion sensor and a structured recording
protocol, complemented by a synthetic dataset of 4h of labeled strumming audio.
A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model is trained to detect
strumming events, classify their direction, and identify the corresponding
chords using only microphone audio. Our evaluation demonstrates significant
improvements over baseline onset detection algorithms, with a hybrid method
combining synthetic and real-world data achieving the highest accuracy for both
strumming action detection and chord classification. These results highlight
the potential of deep learning for robust guitar strumming transcription and
open new avenues for automatic rhythm guitar analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled training data for acoustic guitar fingerpicking is scarce and legally constrained, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: A four-stage pipeline synthesizes training data: tablature composition, MIDI rendering, physical modeling, and audio augmentation. A CRNN model is trained and evaluated on real and synthetic datasets.

Result: Procedural data achieves reasonable note-tracking results; finetuning with real data further improves accuracy over models trained only on real recordings.

Conclusion: Procedurally generated audio is promising for data-scarce music information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Automatic transcription of acoustic guitar fingerpicking performances remains
a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled training data and legal
constraints connected with musical recordings. This work investigates a
procedural data generation pipeline as an alternative to real audio recordings
for training transcription models. Our approach synthesizes training data
through four stages: knowledge-based fingerpicking tablature composition, MIDI
performance rendering, physical modeling using an extended Karplus-Strong
algorithm, and audio augmentation including reverb and distortion. We train and
evaluate a CRNN-based note-tracking model on both real and synthetic datasets,
demonstrating that procedural data can be used to achieve reasonable
note-tracking results. Finetuning with a small amount of real data further
enhances transcription accuracy, improving over models trained exclusively on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALMs lack significant benefits from explicit reasoning for audio question answering and fall short of human-level auditory-language reasoning.

Method: Proposes Audio-Thinker with adaptive think accuracy rewards, external reward models for consistency, and think-based rewards to refine reasoning paths.

Result: Audio-Thinker outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs in benchmarks, showing superior reasoning and generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LALMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language
models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved
their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based
rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant
benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep
reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of
human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability,
consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think
accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on
task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward
model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process,
complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between
valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results

Result: Achieves lower WER (8.3%) than Whisper-tiny (9.7%) and is up to 2.6x faster for long utterances.

Conclusion: Whisfusion offers an efficient solution for long-form ASR with reduced latency and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Fast Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is critical for latency-sensitive
applications such as real-time captioning and meeting transcription. However,
truly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of
autoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive
(NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio
at once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency
bottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained
Whisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves
the AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel
at every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities. We also
introduce a batch-parallel, multi-step decoding strategy that improves accuracy
by increasing the number of candidates with minimal impact on speed. Fine-tuned
solely on LibriSpeech (960h), Whisfusion achieves a lower WER than Whisper-tiny
(8.3% vs. 9.7%), and offers comparable latency on short audio. For longer
utterances (>20s), it is up to 2.6x faster than the AR baseline, establishing a
new, efficient operating point for long-form ASR. The implementation and
training scripts are available at https://github.com/taeyoun811/Whisfusion.

*Beilong Tang,Xiaoxiao Miao,Xin Wang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SEF-MK anonymizes SSL representations by randomly selecting one of multiple k-means models, improving linguistic and emotional preservation but increasing privacy attack risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect speaker privacy while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content, addressing limitations of SSL representations in anonymization.

Method: Proposes SEF-MK, a speaker-embedding-free framework using multiple k-means models (each trained on different speaker subsets) for anonymization.

Result: SEF-MK better preserves linguistic and emotional content but increases vulnerability to privacy attacks.

Conclusion: The framework aids in designing anonymization systems to balance content preservation and privacy protection.

Abstract: Voice anonymization protects speaker privacy by concealing identity while
preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) representations encode linguistic features but preserve speaker traits.
We propose a novel speaker-embedding-free framework called SEF-MK. Instead of
using a single k-means model trained on the entire dataset, SEF-MK anonymizes
SSL representations for each utterance by randomly selecting one of multiple
k-means models, each trained on a different subset of speakers. We explore this
approach from both attacker and user perspectives. Extensive experiments show
that, compared to a single k-means model, SEF-MK with multiple k-means models
better preserves linguistic and emotional content from the user's viewpoint.
However, from the attacker's perspective, utilizing multiple k-means models
boosts the effectiveness of privacy attacks. These insights can aid users in
designing voice anonymization systems to mitigate attacker threats.

Method: Creation of the SCDF dataset with 237,000 utterances, balanced for sex, language, age, and synthesizer type, followed by evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors.

Result: Speaker characteristics (sex, language, age, synthesizer type) significantly influence detection performance, revealing biases.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for bias-aware development in deepfake detection to align with ethical standards.

Abstract: Despite growing attention to deepfake speech detection, the aspects of bias
and fairness remain underexplored in the speech domain. To address this gap, we
introduce the Speaker Characteristics Deepfake (SCDF) dataset: a novel, richly
annotated resource enabling systematic evaluation of demographic biases in
deepfake speech detection. SCDF contains over 237,000 utterances in a balanced
representation of both male and female speakers spanning five languages and a
wide age range. We evaluate several state-of-the-art detectors and show that
speaker characteristics significantly influence detection performance,
revealing disparities across sex, language, age, and synthesizer type. These

*Andrea Corsico,Giorgia Rigamonti,Simone Zini,Luigi Celona,Paolo Napoletano*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A network-specific approach using clustered functional networks improves brain response prediction to multimodal movies, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction accuracy of brain responses by accounting for the functional heterogeneity of brain networks.

Method: Grouped seven functional networks into four clusters and trained separate MLP models for each, enabling cluster-specific optimization and adaptive memory modeling.

Result: Significantly improved prediction accuracy, achieving eighth place in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge with OOD scores nearly double the baseline.

Conclusion: Clustering functional networks and training specialized models per cluster is effective for predicting brain responses to complex stimuli.

Abstract: In this work, we present a network-specific approach for predicting brain
responses to complex multimodal movies, leveraging the Yeo 7-network
parcellation of the Schaefer atlas. Rather than treating the brain as a
homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters
and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for
each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive
memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality
weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results
demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction
accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final
model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge,
with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the
baseline model used in the selection phase. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The brain's efficiency and adaptability inspire the development of AI systems that align with human values and achieve robust learning on low power.

Method: The architecture uses neural ODEs to model CMCs, including spiny stellate, inhibitory, and pyramidal neurons, forming an 8-dimensional dynamical system with biologically plausible connections.

Result: Single CMC nodes achieve 97.8% accuracy on MNIST; hierarchical configurations improve performance on complex tasks with fewer parameters. Phase space analysis shows interpretable dynamical trajectories.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic computing based on brain principles enhances efficiency and interpretability in AI, suggesting new directions for parameter-efficient architectures.

Abstract: The human brain represents the only known example of general intelligence
that naturally aligns with human values. On a mere 20-watt power budget, the
brain achieves robust learning and adaptive decision-making in ways that
continue to elude advanced AI systems. Inspired by the brain, we present a
computational architecture based on canonical microcircuits (CMCs) -
stereotyped patterns of neurons found ubiquitously throughout the cortex. We
implement these circuits as neural ODEs comprising spiny stellate, inhibitory,
and pyramidal neurons, forming an 8-dimensional dynamical system with
biologically plausible recurrent connections. Our experiments show that even a
single CMC node achieves 97.8 percent accuracy on MNIST, while hierarchical
configurations - with learnable inter-regional connectivity and recurrent
connections - yield improved performance on more complex image benchmarks.
Notably, our approach achieves competitive results using substantially fewer
parameters than conventional deep learning models. Phase space analysis
revealed distinct dynamical trajectories for different input classes,
highlighting interpretable, emergent behaviors observed in biological systems.
These findings suggest that neuromorphic computing approaches can improve both
efficiency and interpretability in artificial neural networks, offering new
directions for parameter-efficient architectures grounded in the computational
principles of the human brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores human and AI (Hypothetical Minds) abilities to predict opponent behavior in rock-paper-scissors, identifying cognitive bottlenecks in detecting complex patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational constraints and cognitive mechanisms limiting human ability to predict behavior in strategic games.

Method: Modeling human behavior in rock-paper-scissors against algorithmic opponents and using Hypothetical Minds (HM), a language model-based agent, to simulate and analyze cognitive processes.

Result: HM mirrors human performance, struggling with complex patterns. Providing strategy descriptions improves HM's success, highlighting hypothesis generation as a bottleneck.

Conclusion: Model-based analyses, like HM, offer insights into human cognition and reveal pedagogical interventions can enhance understanding of opponent behavior.

Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the
computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these
questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper,
scissors from Brockbank & Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied
in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns
(e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more
complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms
underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds
(HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses
about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al.,
2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM
closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar
ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might
face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of
ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When
provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM
successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates >80% suggesting that
accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this
task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through
pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially
updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how
model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Top-down feedback in ConvRNNs improves speed-accuracy trade-offs and robustness, especially with stochastic neural variability (dropout). Feedback shapes representational geometry and stabilizes dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional role of top-down feedback in artificial vision models, contrasting with biological systems that use such feedback.

Method: Trained ConvRNNs with/without top-down feedback on image classification, using dropout to simulate stochastic neural variability. Analyzed representational geometry and dynamics.

Result: Feedback improved speed-accuracy trade-offs, noise robustness, and adversarial resilience. Dropout amplified feedback benefits by shaping representational geometry and stabilizing dynamics.

Conclusion: Top-down feedback and neural stochasticity (dropout) together enable resilient sensory coding: feedback stabilizes dynamics, while dropout prevents unit-level co-adaptation.

Abstract: Biological systems leverage top-down feedback for visual processing, yet most
artificial vision models succeed in image classification using purely
feedforward or recurrent architectures, calling into question the functional
significance of descending cortical pathways. Here, we trained convolutional
recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) on image classification in the presence or
absence of top-down feedback projections to elucidate the specific
computational contributions of those feedback pathways. We found that ConvRNNs
with top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and
robustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they
were trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly
silencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify
the reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information
substantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration
layer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was
amplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally
constrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object
information more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down
information stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level.
Together, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding.
On the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit
at the cost of more chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, top-down feedback
harnesses high-level information to stabilize network activity on compact
low-dimensional manifolds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel
materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world
applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and
experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,
minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide
an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the

structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge
from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG
in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic
review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key
materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal
structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining,
database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining
LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the
performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of 2-D SEM in resolving 3-D pore architecture and interconnectivity, which are vital for membrane performance, while avoiding costly and complex tomography.

Method: Developed an enhanced reconstruction algorithm to generate high-fidelity 3-D pore networks from 2-D SEM images, preserving statistical properties and pore morphologies.

Result: Validated with X-ray tomography, the method showed excellent agreement in structural metrics and superior resolution for fine pore features.

Conclusion: The tool is effective for isotropic porous membranes and advances SEM-based 3-D reconstruction, though further work is needed for anisotropic membranes.

Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in
imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore
architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing
membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction
techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically
challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a
proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a
single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those
obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to
replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In
this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction
algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore
size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies.
Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated
a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties.
Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in
structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution
in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic
porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be
visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of
anisotropic membranes.

Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of designing SMAs with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output.

Method: Coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model for gradient-based latent space optimization to generate alloy compositions and processing parameters.

Result: Experimental validation yielded a NiTi-based alloy with superior properties: 404°C transformation temperature, 9.9 J/cm³ work output, 43 J/g enthalpy, and 29°C hysteresis.

Conclusion: GAN inversion is an efficient and generalizable method for property-targeted alloy discovery.

Abstract: The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation
temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge
in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework
based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design
of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property
prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to
directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that
satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally
validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs.
Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a
high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work
output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal
hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced
performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a
finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf
diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This
study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable
route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.

TL;DR: A memory-efficient neural vertex feature representation for 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering, reducing memory use by 80% compared to grid-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional grid-based neural representations consume excessive memory, limiting efficiency in parallel computing hardware.

Method: Stores learnable features directly at mesh vertices, leveraging geometry for compact and structured representation.

Result: Reduces memory consumption to one-fifth (or less) of grid-based methods while maintaining rendering quality.

Conclusion: Neural vertex features offer a memory-efficient alternative for neural rendering, particularly in tasks like neural radiosity.

Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted
in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications.
However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial
memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing
hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized
formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving
explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features
throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh
vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured
representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory
efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with
the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural
representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis
on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces
memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based
representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering
inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional generative approaches by reformulating 3D shape generation as a code-writing task for better integration with artist workflows.

Method: LL3M coordinates specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts based on text prompts, leveraging a retrieval-augmented knowledge base (BlenderRAG).

Result: The system generates interpretable, editable Python code for diverse 3D assets, enabling co-creative loops between agents and users.

Conclusion: Code serves as a powerful, interpretable medium for 3D asset creation, demonstrated by LL3M's effectiveness across various tasks.

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large
language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python
code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns
from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a
code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration
with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of
specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender
scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code
works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented
representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender
constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,
unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues
for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or
procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our
system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while
iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared
code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a
retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API
documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions
empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material
edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code
as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project

TL;DR: Smaller LLMs like Gemma-3-27b-it can estimate research quality scores effectively, though less strongly than larger models like ChatGPT 4o, and without score improvement through repetition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if smaller LLMs can estimate research quality scores comparably to larger models like ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Method: Evaluated Gemma-3-27b-it on 104,187 articles, comparing its scores with expert research quality scores across 34 fields from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021.

Result: Gemma-3-27b-it's scores correlated positively with expert scores, though weaker than ChatGPT 4o (83.8%) and 4o-mini (94.7%). No substantial score improvement through repetition was observed.

Conclusion: Smaller LLMs can estimate research quality scores, useful for cost-saving or offline processing, though larger models remain superior.

Abstract: Although both Google Gemini (1.5 Flash) and ChatGPT (4o and 4o-mini) give
research quality evaluation scores that correlate positively with expert scores
in nearly all fields, and more strongly that citations in most, it is not known
whether this is true for smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). In response,
this article assesses Google's Gemma-3-27b-it, a downloadable LLM (60Gb). The
results for 104,187 articles show that Gemma-3-27b-it scores correlate
positively with an expert research quality score proxy for all 34 Units of
Assessment (broad fields) from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021. The
Gemma-3-27b-it correlations have 83.8% of the strength of ChatGPT 4o and 94.7%
of the strength of ChatGPT 4o-mini correlations. Differently from the two
larger LLMs, the Gemma-3-27b-it correlations do not increase substantially when
the scores are averaged across five repetitions, its scores tend to be lower,
and its reports are relatively uniform in style. Overall, the results show that
research quality score estimation can be conducted by offline LLMs, so this
capability is not an emergent property of the largest LLMs. Moreover, score
improvement through repetition is not a universal feature of LLMs. In
conclusion, although the largest LLMs still have the highest research
evaluation score estimation capability, smaller ones can also be used for this
task, and this can be helpful for cost saving or when secure offline processing
is needed.

### [582] [Exploring Strategies for Personalized Radiation Therapy: Part III Identifying genetic determinants for Radiation Response with Meta Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08030)
*Hao Peng,Yuanyuan Zhang,Steve Jiang,Robert Timmerman,John Minna*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework is introduced for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity (SF2) using gene expression data, outperforming static models like RSI by adapting gene importance per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiation treatments ignore tumor heterogeneity. The study aims to improve radiosensitivity prediction by accounting for individual tumor biology.

Method: A meta-learning model is developed to dynamically adjust gene importance per sample, unlike static models (e.g., RSI) with fixed gene contributions.

Result: The meta-learning model generalizes well to unseen samples and performs robustly in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity variability.

Conclusion: The approach enables personalized therapy by uncovering context-dependent gene patterns and improving predictive accuracy across tumor subtypes.

Abstract: Radiation response in cancer is shaped by complex, patient specific biology,
yet current treatment strategies often rely on uniform dose prescriptions
without accounting for tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce a meta
learning framework for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity measured by SF2
using cell line level gene expression data. Unlike the widely used
Radiosensitivity Index RSI a rank-based linear model trained on a fixed 10-gene
signature, our proposed meta-learned model allows the importance of each gene
to vary by sample through fine tuning. This flexibility addresses key
limitations of static models like RSI, which assume uniform gene contributions
across tumor types and discard expression magnitude and gene gene interactions.
Our results show that meta learning offers robust generalization to unseen
samples and performs well in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity
variability, such as adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. By learning
transferable structure across tasks while preserving sample specific
adaptability, our approach enables rapid adaptation to individual samples,
improving predictive accuracy across diverse tumor subtypes while uncovering
context dependent patterns of gene influence that may inform personalized
therapy.

*Adrian Baule*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion model based on an active particle process, using an effective time-dependent potential on position coordinates for time reversal, validated by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative diffusion models by leveraging active particle dynamics with finite correlation time, focusing on position coordinates rather than velocity.

Method: Implements a generative diffusion model using an effective time-dependent potential on position coordinates, derived from the standard score function and its derivatives.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the proposed effective potential for artificial data distributions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves time reversal in diffusion models using position-based potentials, offering a novel alternative to velocity-based methods.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data
distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the
state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image
synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented
based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In
contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the
velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by
imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only.
The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and
leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function
and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data
distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.

### [584] [Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410)
*Saghar Ganji,Mohammad Naisipour*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based method to improve ENSO forecasting by analyzing and clustering ensemble members for better prediction accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable long-lead ENSO forecasting is challenging, and existing methods like MEF may not fully optimize ensemble performance due to lack of individual member weighting or testing.

Method: A graph-based framework models similarity between 80 ensemble members using RMSE and correlation, clusters them, and selects an optimized subset of 20 members via community detection. The final prediction averages this subset.

Result: The method improves forecast skill by reducing noise and emphasizing coherence. It offers stable outputs, especially in long-lead scenarios, and is model-agnostic.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach enhances ENSO forecasting by leveraging ensemble coherence and stability, with potential applicability to other forecasting models.

Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed
Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two
independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)
and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are
combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other
as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of
individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the
model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this
study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to
directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By
constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose
weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and
cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an
optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final
prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method
improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble
coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical
characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights.
In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always
outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and
consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach
is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other
forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical,
physical, or hybrid models.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CROP enhances LLMs' molecular understanding by integrating topological (graph) and spatial (image) views of molecules efficiently and effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on molecular sequences, missing complex structural insights from topological and spatial views.

Method: CROP uses SMILES Guided Resampler and Structural Embedding Gate to integrate multi-view data into fixed-length prefixes for LLMs.

Result: CROP outperforms in tasks like molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction, and property prediction.

Conclusion: CROP efficiently integrates multi-view molecular data, improving LLM performance in molecular science tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when
relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex
structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two
complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological
relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second
emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image
view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.
To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes
(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view
integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly
resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids
excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy
expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's
self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the
quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a
carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a
Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's
prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks
including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property
prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD), a standardized dataset capturing real-world sensor imperfections for improving microscopic traffic simulation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic simulation models abstract away human driving complexity, while existing datasets are overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect real-world sensing challenges.

Method: The authors present I24-MSD, a dataset preserving sensor imperfections, and adapt noise-aware generative models from autonomous driving for traffic simulation.

Result: Noise-aware models outperform traditional baselines in realism by explicitly addressing data imperfections.

Conclusion: I24-MSD advances microscopic traffic simulation by embracing real-world challenges, aligning better with practical needs.

Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic
simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it
requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic
phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver
simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting
away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent
advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled
the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift
toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most
existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing
to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from
vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion
through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based
sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic
engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset
(I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic
level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning
problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing
from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt
existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with
noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only
outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly
engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a
stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that
embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.

*Keqiang Guo,Yuheng Zhong,Xin Tong,Jiangbin Lyu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: NBF is a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable beam RSRP prediction, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate beam RSRP prediction is crucial for beam management in dense wireless networks but is challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations.

Method: NBF combines a Transformer-based DNN to learn MCPP from sparse data and a physics-inspired module for analytical inference, enhanced by a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy.

Result: NBF outperforms conventional CKMs and pure DNNs in accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization while maintaining compactness.

Conclusion: NBF provides a scalable, physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-gen wireless networks.

Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is
essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet
challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This
paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for
efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our
approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile
(MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam
configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled
``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN)
learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a
physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve
convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC)
strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP
data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly
outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure
blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization,
while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a
scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in
next-generation dense wireless networks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural CKM-based scheduling framework and a low-complexity SM-IB algorithm to address challenges in active IRS systems, improving prediction accuracy and throughput efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in IRS systems, such as severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling, motivate the need for efficient solutions.

Method: Uses Transformer-based DNNs (LPS-Net and SE-Net) to predict link power statistics and ergodic SE from historical data, and introduces the SM-IB scheduling algorithm.

Result: Neural CKM enhances prediction accuracy and efficiency; SM-IB achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with reduced complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and algorithm effectively address key challenges in IRS systems, offering improved performance and scalability.

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant
performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges,
notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to
hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require
efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the
overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both
rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase.
Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework
based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep
neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from
historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions.
Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to
predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further
propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling
algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM
significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while
the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with
greatly reduced complexity.

*Zihao Hu,Jia Yan,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A novel differentially private over-the-air federated distillation framework is proposed to enhance communication efficiency and privacy in federated learning, achieving better trade-offs than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of communication efficiency and privacy preservation in large-scale federated learning models.

Method: Utilizes noise-perturbed model outputs shared via multi-access channels, with co-design of communication and learning to maximize convergence while meeting power and privacy constraints.

Result: Derived optimal transceiver designs and demonstrated superior learning-privacy trade-offs with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms traditional federated learning benchmarks in balancing learning performance and privacy.

Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication
efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL).
In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air
federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs)
periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by
harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly,
over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the
low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the
communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air
FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit
power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the
intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the
strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle
this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and
privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD
round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private
over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with
largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured autoencoder (AE)-based architecture for unequal error protection (UEP) coding, extending AE-based UEP codes to larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern communication systems require UEP coding for differentiated reliability levels, but AE-based UEP coding at intermediate blocklengths remains unexplored due to complexity.

Method: The method structures encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, inspired by superposition coding and SIC decoding in conventional UEP schemes.

Result: Numerical results show the approach outperforms established achievability bounds of randomized superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding.

Conclusion: The structured AE-based UEP codes are scalable and efficient, suitable for next-generation networks.

Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability
levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication
systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context
of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their
application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate
blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by
the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference
cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a
structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to
substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By
structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method
provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while
adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed
approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized
superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed
structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for
next-generation networks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A robust codebook-assisted image semantic communication system is proposed to mitigate channel noise effects by jointly constructing semantic codec and codebook, and designing a vector-to-index transformer for improved image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current codebook-based semantic communication systems are vulnerable to channel noise due to mismatched semantic relations and code indices, necessitating a robust design.

Method: Joint construction of semantic codec and codebook, followed by a vector-to-index transformer to counteract noise and enable image generation.

Result: The system outperforms JPEG+LDPC and traditional JSCC methods in visual perception and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances semantic communication robustness and image generation quality, validated by numerical and visual results.

Abstract: Codebook-based generative semantic communication attracts increasing
attention, since only indices are required to be transmitted when the codebook
is shared between transmitter and receiver. However, due to the fact that the
semantic relations among code vectors are not necessarily related to the
distance of the corresponding code indices, the performance of the
codebook-enabled semantic communication system is susceptible to the channel
noise. Thus, how to improve the system robustness against the noise requires
careful design. This paper proposes a robust codebook-assisted image semantic
communication system, where semantic codec and codebook are first jointly
constructed, and then vector-to-index transformer is designed guided by the
codebook to eliminate the effects of channel noise, and achieve image
generation. Thanks to the assistance of the high-quality codebook to the
Transformer, the generated images at the receiver outperform those of the
compared methods in terms of visual perception. In the end, numerical results
and generated images demonstrate the advantages of the generative semantic
communication method over JPEG+LDPC and traditional joint source channel coding
(JSCC) methods.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposed adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) for semantic communications (SemComs) outperforms deep JSCC and SSCC, ensuring compatibility with digital systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current JSCC in SemComs lacks compatibility with existing systems and adaptability to source/channel variations, while SSCC is suboptimal in finite blocklength regimes.

Method: ASCC combines DNN-based semantic source coding and digital channel coding, modeling distortions via logistic regression and solving optimization for rate and power allocation.

Result: ASCC outperforms deep JSCC and SSCC in single- and parallel-channel scenarios, maintaining practical system compatibility.

Conclusion: ASCC is a viable solution for SemComs, balancing performance and compatibility with existing digital systems.

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the
bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However,
current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with
the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the
sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is
suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over
parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic
source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed
and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and
channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as
functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic
regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E
distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power
allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex
approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC
scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and
parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical
digital systems.

TL;DR: The paper resolves whether accelerated gradient descent (AGD) can achieve optimal complexity under generalized smoothness conditions, proposing new algorithms and a Lyapunov function to achieve provably optimal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing extensions of AGD under generalized smoothness conditions, which either incur extra dependencies or exponential factors, leaving the optimality question unresolved.

Method: The authors leverage a new Lyapunov function and design new algorithms to achieve optimal oracle complexity under generalized smoothness conditions.

Result: They achieve $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$ oracle complexity for small-ε, proving optimality in the small-ε regime and removing non-constant multiplicative factors.

Conclusion: The work resolves the open question, demonstrating that AGD-type optimal rates are achievable under generalized smoothness conditions with new algorithmic insights.

Abstract: We study first-order methods for convex optimization problems with functions
$f$ satisfying the recently proposed $\ell$-smoothness condition
$||\nabla^{2}f(x)|| \le \ell\left(||\nabla f(x)||\right),$ which generalizes
the $L$-smoothness and $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness. While accelerated gradient
descent AGD is known to reach the optimal complexity $O(\sqrt{L} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under $L$-smoothness, where $\varepsilon$ is an error
tolerance and $R$ is the distance between a starting and an optimal point,
existing extensions to $\ell$-smoothness either incur extra dependence on the
initial gradient, suffer exponential factors in $L_{1} R$, or require costly
auxiliary sub-routines, leaving open whether an AGD-type $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ rate is possible for small-$\varepsilon$, even in the
$(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness case.
  We resolve this open question. Leveraging a new Lyapunov function and
designing new algorithms, we achieve $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$
oracle complexity for small-$\varepsilon$ and virtually any $\ell$. For
instance, for $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness, our bound $O(\sqrt{L_0} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ is provably optimal in the small-$\varepsilon$ regime and
removes all non-constant multiplicative factors present in prior accelerated
algorithms.

Abstract: Integer and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (INLP, MINLP) are central to
logistics, energy, and scheduling, but remain computationally challenging. This
survey examines how machine learning and reinforcement learning can enhance
exact optimization methods - particularly branch-and-bound (BB), without
compromising global optimality. We cover discrete, continuous, and
mixed-integer formulations, and highlight applications such as crew scheduling,
vehicle routing, and hydropower planning. We introduce a unified BB framework
that embeds learning-based strategies into branching, cut selection, node
ordering, and parameter control. Classical algorithms are augmented using
supervised, imitation, and reinforcement learning models to accelerate
convergence while maintaining correctness. We conclude with a taxonomy of
learning methods by solver class and learning paradigm, and outline open
challenges in generalization, hybridization, and scaling intelligent solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance data-driven control methods for nonlinear systems by solving key problems related to the Koopman operator and nonlinear fundamental lemma.

Method: The method involves constructing a product Hilbert space via tensor products, deriving a generalized Koopman operator, and developing a scalable data-driven approach for finite-dimensional approximations.

Result: The paper proves the existence of an infinite-dimensional generalized Koopman operator and derives a nonlinear fundamental lemma. It also presents practical methods for computation and observable function selection.

Conclusion: The proposed generalized Koopman embedding is effective, as demonstrated on the Van der Pol oscillator, providing a foundation for nonlinear data-driven control.

Abstract: The generalization of the Koopman operator to systems with control input and
the derivation of a nonlinear fundamental lemma are two open problems that play
a key role in the development of data-driven control methods for nonlinear
systems. Both problems hinge on the construction of observable or basis
functions and their corresponding Hilbert space that enable an
infinite-dimensional, linear system representation. In this paper we derive a
novel solution to these problems based on orthonormal expansion in a product
Hilbert space constructed as the tensor product between the Hilbert spaces of
the state and input observable functions, respectively. We prove that there
exists an infinite-dimensional linear operator, i.e. the generalized Koopman
operator, from the constructed product Hilbert space to the Hilbert space
corresponding to the lifted state propagated forward in time. A scalable
data-driven method for computing finite-dimensional approximations of
generalized Koopman operators and several choices of observable functions are
also presented. Moreover, we derive a nonlinear fundamental lemma by exploiting
the bilinear structure of the infinite-dimensional generalized Koopman model.
The effectiveness of the developed generalized Koopman embedding is illustrated
on the Van der Pol oscillator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods focus on static datasets, but real-world applications involve streaming data, requiring new solutions for privacy and efficiency.

Method: Uses penalized renewable estimation and proximal gradient descent for training, ensuring privacy and reducing storage by exchanging only summary statistics.

Result: Theoretical consistency in estimation, variable selection, and subgroup recovery; simulations and real-world data (financial lending, web logs) show superior performance.

Conclusion: FOL effectively handles streaming data in federated settings, balancing privacy, storage, and performance, with practical insights for applications.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an essential paradigm for distributed
multi-source data analysis under privacy concerns. Most existing federated
learning methods focus on the ``static" datasets. However, in many real-world
applications, data arrive continuously over time, forming streaming datasets.
This introduces additional challenges for data storage and algorithm design,
particularly under high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a
federated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming
data analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is
constructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup" assumption is
employed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model
performance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the
efficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method
aligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not
exchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of
previous data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing
storage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for
model estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery,
demonstrating optimal statistical efficiency. Simulations illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, when applied to the
financial lending data and the web log data, the proposed method also exhibits
advantageous prediction performance. Results of the analysis also provide some
practical insights.

### [597] [MOCA-HESP: Meta High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization for Combinatorial and Mixed Spaces via Hyper-ellipsoid Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06847)
*Lam Ngo,Huong Ha,Jeffrey Chan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MOCA-HESP is a high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization method for combinatorial and mixed variables, using hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning and adaptive encoder selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BO methods focus on continuous domains, leaving combinatorial and mixed domains challenging.

Method: Leverages HESP with categorical encoders and a multi-armed bandit for adaptive encoder selection. Integrates with other BO optimizers.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOCA-HESP enhances BO performance in combinatorial and mixed domains, with practical applications.

Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) has attracted significant
attention in recent research. However, existing methods have mainly focused on
optimizing in continuous domains, while combinatorial (ordinal and categorical)
and mixed domains still remain challenging. In this paper, we first propose
MOCA-HESP, a novel high-dimensional BO method for combinatorial and mixed
variables. The key idea is to leverage the hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning
(HESP) technique with different categorical encoders to work with
high-dimensional, combinatorial and mixed spaces, while adaptively selecting
the optimal encoders for HESP using a multi-armed bandit technique. Our method,
MOCA-HESP, is designed as a \textit{meta-algorithm} such that it can
incorporate other combinatorial and mixed BO optimizers to further enhance the
optimizers' performance. Finally, we develop three practical BO methods by
integrating MOCA-HESP with state-of-the-art BO optimizers for combinatorial and
mixed variables: standard BO, CASMOPOLITAN, and Bounce. Our experimental
results on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our methods
outperform existing baselines. Our code implementation can be found at

### [598] [Statistical Inference for Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection after Representation Learning-based Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07049)
*Tran Tuan Kiet,Nguyen Thang Loi,Vo Nguyen Le Duy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: STAND-DA is a framework for statistically rigorous anomaly detection after domain adaptation, ensuring valid p-values and controlled false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection performance suffers in target domains with limited data, and domain adaptation introduces uncertainty, making results statistically unreliable.

Method: STAND-DA uses Selective Inference for valid p-values and GPU acceleration to handle deep learning models efficiently.

Result: The method controls false positives and scales well, validated by experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: STAND-DA provides a statistically sound and computationally efficient solution for anomaly detection post-domain adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of domains, but
its performance might deteriorate when applied to target domains with limited
data. Domain Adaptation (DA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a
related source domain with abundant data. However, this adaptation process can
introduce additional uncertainty, making it difficult to draw statistically
valid conclusions from AD results. In this paper, we propose STAND-DA -- a
novel framework for statistically rigorous Autoencoder-based AD after
Representation Learning-based DA. Built on the Selective Inference (SI)
framework, STAND-DA computes valid $p$-values for detected anomalies and
rigorously controls the false positive rate below a pre-specified level
$\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). To address the computational challenges of applying SI
to deep learning models, we develop the GPU-accelerated SI implementation,
significantly enhancing both scalability and runtime performance. This
advancement makes SI practically feasible for modern, large-scale deep
architectures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
validate the theoretical results and computational efficiency of the proposed
STAND-DA method.

### [599] [Membership Inference Attacks with False Discovery Rate Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07066)
*Chenxu Zhao,Wei Qian,Aobo Chen,Mengdi Huai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel membership inference attack (MIA) method is proposed to guarantee false discovery rate (FDR) control, addressing limitations in existing MIA works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIA methods lack guarantees on false discovery rates due to unknown distributions and interdependent probabilities, necessitating a solution.

Method: The paper introduces a new MIA method that ensures FDR guarantees and marginal probability control, functioning as a post-hoc wrapper for existing methods.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse settings (e.g., black-box, lifelong learning) confirm the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully provides FDR guarantees and enhances MIA reliability, demonstrating practical utility across various scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record
was used to train a target model or not. To analyze and study these
vulnerabilities, various MIA methods have been proposed. Despite the
significance and popularity of MIAs, existing works on MIAs are limited in
providing guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR), which refers to the
expected proportion of false discoveries among the identified positive
discoveries. However, it is very challenging to ensure the false discovery rate
guarantees, because the underlying distribution is usually unknown, and the
estimated non-member probabilities often exhibit interdependence. To tackle the
above challenges, in this paper, we design a novel membership inference attack
method, which can provide the guarantees on the false discovery rate.
Additionally, we show that our method can also provide the marginal probability
guarantee on labeling true non-member data as member data. Notably, our method
can work as a wrapper that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MIA
methods in a post-hoc manner, while also providing the FDR control. We perform
the theoretical analysis for our method. Extensive experiments in various
settings (e.g., the black-box setting and the lifelong learning setting) are
also conducted to verify the desirable performance of our method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper unifies fading memory and the echo state property in reservoir computing, showing their robustness in deterministic and stochastic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To strengthen the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing by exploring fading memory and the echo state property in broader contexts.

Method: Investigates state-space systems, analyzes solution stability, and introduces a distributional perspective for stochastic cases.

Result: Demonstrates that fading memory and stability hold generically, even without strict contractivity, and proposes a novel theory for stochastic echo states.

Conclusion: The work generalizes previous findings, offering insights into causality, stability, and memory, and supports reliable generative modeling of temporal data.

Abstract: This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by
providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property
(ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space
systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that
fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of
the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models
without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically
assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective
rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which
leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous
work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality,
stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable
generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic
regimes.

### [601] [Meta Off-Policy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07914)
*Olivier Jeunen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-analysis framework to combine multiple off-policy estimation (OPE) methods into a single, more accurate estimate, improving statistical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of combining competing OPE estimators into a unified, reliable estimate while accounting for dependencies from shared data.

Method: Uses a correlated fixed-effects meta-analysis framework to produce a best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) and conservative confidence intervals.

Result: Validated on simulated and real-world data, showing improved statistical efficiency over individual estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines OPE estimators, enhancing accuracy and reliability in offline evaluation of recommender systems.

Abstract: Off-policy estimation (OPE) methods enable unbiased offline evaluation of
recommender systems, directly estimating the online reward some target policy
would have obtained, from offline data and with statistical guarantees. The
theoretical elegance of the framework combined with practical successes have
led to a surge of interest, with many competing estimators now available to
practitioners and researchers. Among these, Doubly Robust methods provide a
prominent strategy to combine value- and policy-based estimators.
  In this work, we take an alternative perspective to combine a set of OPE
estimators and their associated confidence intervals into a single, more
accurate estimate. Our approach leverages a correlated fixed-effects
meta-analysis framework, explicitly accounting for dependencies among
estimators that arise due to shared data. This yields a best linear unbiased
estimate (BLUE) of the target policy's value, along with an appropriately
conservative confidence interval that reflects inter-estimator correlation. We
validate our method on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating
improved statistical efficiency over existing individual estimators.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Non-asymptotic bounds for normal approximation in linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms are derived, showing interactions between timescales and differences in last iterate vs. Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the accuracy of normal approximation in TTSA algorithms under martingale difference or Markov noise, and explore the impact of timescale separation.

Method: Analyze last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, using convex distance between probability distributions and high-order moment bounds.

Result: Last iterate's normal approximation improves with timescale separation, while Polyak-Ruppert averaging's rate decreases. High-order moment bounds for TTSA error are also provided.

Conclusion: The study reveals complex interactions between timescales in TTSA algorithms, with implications for both last iterate and averaged regimes, and offers additional insights through high-order moment bounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal
approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA)
algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both
the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for
normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability
distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast
and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate
improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the
Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds
for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.

*Leonardo V. Santoro,Victor M. Panaretos*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel kernel-based nonparametric two-sample test using combined kernel mean and covariance embeddings, leveraging Gaussian measures in RKHS for detecting equality vs. singularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve power in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes by unifying and extending prior approaches like spectrally regularized MMD.

Method: Constructs a test statistic based on relative entropy (likelihood ratio) between Gaussian embeddings, regularized and calibrated via permutation.

Result: Proves consistency, provides uniform power guarantees, and shows superior empirical performance on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially in challenging scenarios like high dimensions and weak signals.

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based nonparametric two-sample test, employing the
combined use of kernel mean and kernel covariance embedding. Our test builds on
recent results showing how such combined embeddings map distinct probability
measures to mutually singular Gaussian measures on the kernel's RKHS.
Leveraging this result, we construct a test statistic based on the relative
entropy between the Gaussian embeddings, i.e.\ the likelihood ratio. The
likelihood ratio is specifically tailored to detect equality versus singularity
of two Gaussians, and satisfies a ``$0/\infty$" law, in that it vanishes under
the null and diverges under the alternative. To implement the test in finite
samples, we introduce a regularised version, calibrated by way of permutation.
We prove consistency, establish uniform power guarantees under mild conditions,
and discuss how our framework unifies and extends prior approaches based on
spectrally regularized MMD. Empirical results on synthetic and real data
demonstrate remarkable gains in power compared to state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes.

TL;DR: The study demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can effectively annotate financial tweets and discover alpha signals, revealing statistically significant negative alpha for certain event labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of LLMs in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery from social media sentiment.

Method: Using an LLM to label high-sentiment tweets and aligning them with forward returns to evaluate statistical efficacy and tradability.

Result: Certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha with significant Sharpe ratios and information coefficients.

Conclusion: Social media sentiment is a valuable but noisy signal for financial forecasting, and open-source frameworks can democratize trading research.

Abstract: In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language
models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery.
Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically
assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We
align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day
horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our
experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha,
with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05,
all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study
establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into
structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its
commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are
made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social
media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting
and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize
algorithmic trading research.

TL;DR: The paper explores deploying machine learning models, specifically graph neural networks, for real-time data filtering (triggering) in particle physics experiments like LHCb, optimizing throughput and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for higher precision in particle physics requires handling massive datasets, necessitating efficient real-time filtering (triggering) to manage computational resources.

Method: A graph neural network-based pipeline was developed for charged particle track reconstruction at LHCb, implemented on GPUs and FPGAs, and compared against classical algorithms.

Result: The pipeline's performance was evaluated in terms of throughput and energy consumption, showing potential improvements over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, particularly graph neural networks, can enhance real-time data processing in high-energy physics, offering efficiency gains in both speed and power usage.

Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order
to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets
are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam
experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly
implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational
resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is
gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in
real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to
perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the
universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering,
known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies
as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine
learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to
maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern
hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in
order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.
In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for
charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The
pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely
on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms
currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA
architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing
speed was compared against the GPU implementation.

TL;DR: A nonparametric framework optimizes reaction coordinates for rare events, validated in protein folding, phase space dynamics, and clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately capture rare event dynamics in complex systems without exhaustive sampling.

Method: Nonparametric reaction coordinate optimization incorporating trajectory histories for robustness.

Result: Accurate committor estimates, high-resolution free energy profiles, and validated applications in diverse systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible, robust solution for analyzing complex dynamics and longitudinal datasets.

Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding,
chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate
phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics.
Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the
progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such
processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that
incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular
or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through
increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it
provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and
yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further
illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean
circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results
demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without
exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general,
flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and
longitudinal datasets.

TL;DR: PiKV is a distributed KV cache framework for MoE architectures, reducing memory and communication costs by partitioning caches, optimizing routing, and integrating compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dense and globally synchronized KV caches in MoE architectures create memory and communication bottlenecks in large language models.

Method: PiKV uses expert-sharded KV storage, optimized routing, adaptive scheduling, and compression modules to manage KV caches efficiently.

Result: PiKV is open-source and integrates with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, aiming to be a comprehensive KV cache management system.

Conclusion: PiKV addresses the KV cache bottleneck in MoE architectures and is actively developed for broader adoption.

Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context
length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has
become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While
MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding
KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant
overhead.
  We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving
framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded
KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce
token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain
query-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates
\textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.
  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library:

TL;DR: The paper proposes optimizations for Federated Learning (FL) in IoT-based power consumption monitoring to address non-IID data and scalability challenges, achieving high accuracy with low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-sensitive, scalable, and accurate demand forecasting in micro-grids and city utilities without exposing consumer data.

Method: Develops FL optimizations for DNN-based time-series forecasting, including exponentially weighted loss, and evaluates them on 1000s of clients using OpenEIA data.

Result: The proposed FL methods outperform baselines like ARIMA and individual DNNs in accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: FL with optimizations is effective for privacy-preserving, scalable power demand forecasting.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through
the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid
operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for
predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns.
Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training
approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data
locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges
exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID)
data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to
1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several
optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand
forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a
high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the
benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it
further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these
strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from
the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and
a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods
over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are
not scalable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasonRank, a reasoning-intensive reranker, using automated data synthesis and a two-stage training approach to improve listwise ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rerankers struggle with complex ranking scenarios due to lack of reasoning-intensive training data.

Method: Proposes a data synthesis framework and a two-stage post-training approach (SFT + RL) with a multi-view ranking reward.

Result: ReasonRank outperforms baselines, achieves SOTA performance (40.6 on BRIGHT leaderboard), and reduces latency.

Conclusion: ReasonRank effectively enhances reasoning-intensive listwise ranking, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior
performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large
Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning
during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to
the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform
poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of
reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we
first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis
framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and
applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A
self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data
quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we
further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a
reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.
During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a
multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based
reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive
reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and
also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through
further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT

TL;DR: PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework, improves personalized retrieval-augmented generation by explicitly reasoning over user profiles, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on LLMs to implicitly integrate retrieved user profiles, leading to sensitivity to retrieval quality and misaligned responses.

Method: PrLM uses reinforcement learning and a contrastively trained personalization reward model to train LLMs for explicit reasoning over user profiles.

Result: PrLM outperforms existing methods on three personalized text generation datasets and remains robust across varying retrieval conditions.

Conclusion: PrLM addresses limitations of implicit integration, offering a robust solution for personalized retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Personalized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to produce
user-tailored responses by incorporating retrieved user profiles alongside the
input query. Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely
on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context
with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality
and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework
that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a
contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns
from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on
three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing
methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and
different retrievers.

*Christos Tsirigotis,Vaibhav Adlakha,Joao Monteiro,Aaron Courville,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BiXSE is a pointwise training method using LLM-generated graded relevance scores for dense retrieval, outperforming contrastive learning and matching pairwise baselines with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world relevance is often graded, not binary, and LLMs enable scalable fine-grained label generation.

Method: BiXSE optimizes binary cross-entropy over LLM-generated graded relevance scores, treating them as probabilistic targets for granular supervision.

Result: BiXSE outperforms InfoNCE and matches/exceeds pairwise baselines on benchmarks like MMTEB, BEIR, and TREC-DL.

Conclusion: BiXSE provides a scalable, efficient alternative for dense retrieval training as graded relevance labels become more accessible.

Abstract: Neural sentence embedding models for dense retrieval typically rely on binary
relevance labels, treating query-document pairs as either relevant or
irrelevant. However, real-world relevance often exists on a continuum, and
recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to scale
the generation of fine-grained graded relevance labels. In this work, we
propose BiXSE, a simple and effective pointwise training method that optimizes
binary cross-entropy (BCE) over LLM-generated graded relevance scores. BiXSE
interprets these scores as probabilistic targets, enabling granular supervision
from a single labeled query-document pair per query. Unlike pairwise or
listwise losses that require multiple annotated comparisons per query, BiXSE
achieves strong performance with reduced annotation and compute costs by
leveraging in-batch negatives. Extensive experiments across sentence embedding
(MMTEB) and retrieval benchmarks (BEIR, TREC-DL) show that BiXSE consistently
outperforms softmax-based contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and matches or
exceeds strong pairwise ranking baselines when trained on LLM-supervised data.
BiXSE offers a robust, scalable alternative for training dense retrieval models
as graded relevance supervision becomes increasingly accessible.

### [612] [Improving Document Retrieval Coherence for Semantically Equivalent Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07975)
*Stefano Campese,Alessandro Moschitti,Ivano Lauriola*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a variation of the Multi-Negative Ranking loss to improve the coherence of Dense Retrieval (DR) models in retrieving consistent documents for semantically similar queries, reducing sensitivity and increasing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR models are sensitive to lexical variations in queries, leading to inconsistent document retrieval. The goal is to enhance model coherence for semantically equivalent queries.

Method: Proposes a modified Multi-Negative Ranking loss that penalizes discrepancies in top-k document rankings for semantically similar queries.

Result: Experiments on MS-MARCO, Natural Questions, BEIR, and TREC DL 19/20 show reduced sensitivity and improved accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function enhances DR model coherence and performance, making them more robust to query variations.

Abstract: Dense Retrieval (DR) models have proven to be effective for Document
Retrieval and Information Grounding tasks. Usually, these models are trained
and optimized for improving the relevance of top-ranked documents for a given
query. Previous work has shown that popular DR models are sensitive to the
query and document lexicon: small variations of it may lead to a significant
difference in the set of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a
variation of the Multi-Negative Ranking loss for training DR that improves the
coherence of models in retrieving the same documents with respect to
semantically similar queries. The loss penalizes discrepancies between the
top-k ranked documents retrieved for diverse but semantic equivalent queries.
We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, MS-MARCO, Natural
Questions, BEIR, and TREC DL 19/20. The results show that (i) models optimizes
by our loss are subject to lower sensitivity, and, (ii) interestingly, higher
accuracy.

*Jiejun Tan,Zhicheng Dou,Yan Yu,Jiehan Cheng,Qiang Ju,Jian Xie,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HierSearch is a hierarchical agentic deep search framework using hierarchical RL to improve efficiency and accuracy in multi-source retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises need private deep search systems that can leverage both local and Web corpus, but existing methods are limited to single sources and suffer from inefficiency and poor tool mastery.

Method: HierSearch employs hierarchical RL with low-level agents for local and Web search, a high-level planner for coordination, and a knowledge refiner to filter errors.

Result: HierSearch outperforms flat RL and other baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach effectively addresses inefficiency and error propagation in multi-source deep search, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and
coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in
challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are
generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.
However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can
leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an
agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning
(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data
efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we
propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with
hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep
search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.
At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides
the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error
propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and
irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that
HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms
various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines
in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

### [614] [CLAP: Coreference-Linked Augmentation for Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06941)
*Huanwei Xu,Lin Xu,Liang Yuan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CLAP improves dense retrieval by segmenting passages, resolving coreferences, and generating aligned pseudo-queries, outperforming traditional methods like BM25 + MonoT5-3B, especially in out-of-domain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based passage expansion methods underperform due to semantic drift, misalignment, and noise from irrelevant content. Coreference continuity issues further degrade performance.

Method: CLAP segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever representations. It fuses global and fine-grained signals for robust performance.

Result: CLAP achieves up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement, matching or surpassing second-stage rankers like BM25 + MonoT5-3B, especially in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: CLAP's logic-centric pipeline enables domain-agnostic generalization, making it a robust solution for enhancing dense retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for
enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers
due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space.
Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query,
while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques
that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation
for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that
segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and
generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever
representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained
subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields
consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense
retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B,
with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are
especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based
expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts
a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.

*Guanchen Wang,Mingming Ha,Tianbao Ma,Linxun Chen,Zhaojie Liu,Guorui Zhou,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (KSER) to improve recommender systems by selectively using high-quality knowledge from LLMs, addressing issues like hallucination and redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage LLMs' generalization and reasoning for better recommendations while mitigating issues like hallucination and redundant information.

Method: Introduces KSER with two modules: knowledge filtering (ESFNet) and embedding alignment (attention-based). Offers two training strategies: all-parameters and extractor-only.

Result: Validates the necessity of filtering and alignment, showing effectiveness of extractor-only training for knowledge-augmented recommendations.

Conclusion: KSER effectively selects and aligns LLM knowledge for improved recommender performance, with flexible training strategies.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging the impressive
generalization capabilities and reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) to improve the performance of recommenders. With this operation,
recommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning
information via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the
world knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content
redundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated
response embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable
performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge
Selection \& Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively
select and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework
consists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding
spaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding
Selection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to
different knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space
alignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the
semantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the
recommendation models. In addition, two training
strategies--\textbf{all-parameters training} and \textbf{extractor-only
training}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and
application scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a
novel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation. Experimental results
validate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and
alignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the extractor-only training strategy.

*Amit Jaspal,Kapil Dalwani,Ajantha Ramineni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SocRipple is a two-stage framework for cold-start item distribution in social platforms, improving exposure by 36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start items lack interaction history, making personalized distribution challenging. Existing methods (collaborative filtering, content-only) are inadequate.

Method: Stage 1 uses creators' social connections for initial exposure. Stage 2 leverages early engagement signals and KNN search to expand reach.

Result: SocRipple boosts cold-start item distribution by 36% while maintaining user engagement rates.

Conclusion: SocRipple effectively balances new item exposure with personalized recommendations, addressing cold-start challenges.

Abstract: Most industry scale recommender systems face critical cold start challenges
new items lack interaction history, making it difficult to distribute them in a
personalized manner. Standard collaborative filtering models underperform due
to sparse engagement signals, while content only approaches lack user specific
relevance. We propose SocRipple, a novel two stage retrieval framework tailored
for coldstart item distribution in social graph based platforms. Stage 1
leverages the creators social connections for targeted initial exposure. Stage
2 builds on early engagement signals and stable user embeddings learned from
historical interactions to "ripple" outwards via K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
search. Large scale experiments on a major video platform show that SocRipple
boosts cold start item distribution by +36% while maintaining user engagement
rate on cold start items, effectively balancing new item exposure with
personalized recommendations.

*Danil Gusak,Nikita Sukhorukov,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines the arbitrary selection of cold-start thresholds in recommender systems, showing how inconsistent thresholds impact data quality and evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in choosing cold-start thresholds, which affects comparability and reliability of recommender system evaluations.

Method: Systematically explores cold-start boundaries by varying interaction thresholds for items and users across multiple datasets and baselines.

Result: Inconsistent threshold selection can remove valuable data or misclassify cold instances as warm, introducing noise.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for standardized cold-start threshold selection to improve evaluation consistency in recommender systems.

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include
filtering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold.
However, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across
studies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the
comparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we
systematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used
to determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our
experiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items
during training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories
during inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used
datasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and
on multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that
inconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the
unnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold
instances as warm, introducing more noise into the system.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DIVER is a retrieval pipeline designed for reasoning-intensive tasks, outperforming existing models on complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrievers struggle with abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference in queries.

Method: DIVER includes document processing, LLM-driven query expansion, a reasoning-enhanced retriever, and a pointwise reranker.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware retrieval strategies are effective for complex tasks; code and model will be released.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified
through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries
involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which
existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we
present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive
information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing
to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document
interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic
multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines
LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark,
DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original
queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies
in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released
soon.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MAMEX, a Mixture of Experts framework, improves cold-start recommendations by dynamically weighting multimodal data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start scenarios in recommendation systems struggle with new items lacking interaction history. Existing methods poorly integrate multimodal data.

Method: MAMEX uses modality-specific expert networks and a learnable gating mechanism to dynamically weight multimodal contributions.

Result: MAMEX achieves superior accuracy and adaptability in cold-start scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAMEX effectively addresses cold-start challenges by leveraging multimodal data dynamically, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have faced significant challenges in cold-start
scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be
effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text,
audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches
often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average
pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex
relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which
dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX
utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating
mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on
its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most
informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain
modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show that MAMEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start
scenarios, with superior accuracy and adaptability. For reproducibility, the
code has been made available on Github https://github.com/L2R-UET/MAMEX.

TL;DR: A lightweight method combining anatomical knowledge and rule-based topology constraints for automated coronary artery labelling, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major global health issue, and CTCA is vital for diagnosis. Current labelling methods are inefficient or lack clinical knowledge integration.

Method: Proposes a lightweight approach integrating anatomical knowledge and rule-based topology constraints for coronary artery labelling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Offers a promising, efficient solution for automated coronary artery labelling, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Result: Achieved 91.7% accuracy, 91.9% precision, 91.7% recall, and 91.6% F1-score. Grad-CAM++ visualizations aligned well with expert annotations (Dice=0.88, IoU=0.78). Radiologists rated interpretability highly (mean=4.4 for usefulness).

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant solution for automated brain tumor classification, enhancing deep learning integration in neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Motivation: To improve personalized medicine for MS by forecasting lesion progression using generative models.

Method: A voxel-space approach incorporating MRI and treatment data to predict future NET2 lesion masks.

Result: Accurate prediction of NET2 lesion masks across six treatments, with potential for clinical applications like lesion count estimation and counterfactual analysis.

Conclusion: The model showcases the promise of causal, image-based generative models for MS prognostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of hallucinations in LLMs used for medical imaging, which can mislead clinical decisions.

Method: Analyzes hallucinations in two tasks: image-to-text (report generation) and text-to-image (image synthesis), using expert criteria to evaluate errors like factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies.

Result: Reveals common hallucination patterns in both tasks, highlighting issues with clinical reliability. Identifies contributing factors like model architecture and training data.

Conclusion: Provides insights for improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM-driven medical imaging systems by understanding and mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high storage demands of 3DGS hinder practical use, and current compression methods introduce distortions without proper quality assessment.

Method: Created a large-scale VQA dataset (3DGS-VBench) with 660 compressed 3DGS models and videos from 11 scenes, annotated by 50 participants for MOS scores.

Result: Benchmarked 6 compression algorithms on storage and visual quality, and evaluated 15 quality metrics.

Conclusion: 3DGS-VBench facilitates specialized VQA model training and advances research in 3DGS compression and quality assessment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high
visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical
deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate
compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques
introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To
this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment
(VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences
generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with
systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50
participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset
reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency
and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple
paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as
a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research. The dataset is

TL;DR: SAGCNet improves MRI slice imputation by modeling inter-slice relationships and leveraging 3D spatial context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical MRI accuracy is hindered by missing or unusable slices, necessitating better volumetric synthesis methods.

Method: SAGCNet uses a volumetric slice graph completion module and a spatial adapter to model inter-slice relationships and 3D context.

Result: SAGCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing missing cardiac MRI slices, even with limited data.

Conclusion: SAGCNet effectively addresses challenges in volumetric MRI synthesis, offering robust performance for clinical applications.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Motivation: The heterogeneity among MRI sequences limits deep learning model generalization, restricting clinical utility. PRISM aims to address this by learning robust, generalizable representations.

Method: PRISM uses a novel pretraining paradigm on 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets, disentangling anatomical invariants from sequence-specific variations.

Result: PRISM achieved top performance in 39/44 downstream tasks, showing significant improvements over non-pretrained and existing foundation models.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances AI's translational potential in radiology by delivering consistent performance across diverse MRI protocols, improving clinical applicability.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

*Xuepeng Liu,Zheng Jiang,Pinan Zhu,Hanyu Liu,Chao Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HaDM-ST improves spatial transcriptomics resolution by leveraging H&E images and low-resolution ST, addressing challenges in feature extraction, alignment, and gene-specific modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ST methods lack resolution and face challenges in integrating H&E images for accurate spatial gene expression prediction.

Method: HaDM-ST uses semantic distillation, spatial alignment, and channel-aware adversarial learning to enhance ST resolution.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in spatial fidelity and gene-level coherence across diverse tissues and species.

Conclusion: HaDM-ST effectively addresses key challenges in high-resolution ST generation, offering improved accuracy and coherence.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and
gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

*Wenzhuo Ma,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffVC-OSD is a one-step diffusion-based video compression framework that improves perceptual quality and speed over multi-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance perceptual quality and reduce computational complexity in video compression by simplifying the diffusion process to a single step.

Method: Uses a One-Step Diffusion Model guided by temporal context and latent representation, a Temporal Context Adapter for fine-grained guidance, and End-to-End Finetuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression, 20× faster decoding, and 86.92% bitrate reduction compared to multi-step variants.

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD is an efficient and high-quality solution for neural video compression.

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ALDEN is a deep learning-based method for LDCT denoising that incorporates anatomical semantics using pretrained vision models, adversarial learning, and contrastive learning to improve noise reduction and preserve tissue-specific details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDCT denoising methods often ignore anatomical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. ALDEN aims to address this by integrating tissue-specific features for better denoising.

Method: ALDEN uses an anatomy-aware discriminator with cross-attention mechanisms and a semantic-guided contrastive learning module to enforce anatomical consistency and reduce artifacts.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on LDCT denoising datasets, preserving anatomical details and reducing over-smoothing. It also performs well on a multi-organ segmentation task.

Conclusion: ALDEN effectively integrates anatomical semantics into LDCT denoising, outperforming previous methods and maintaining anatomical accuracy for downstream tasks.

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, accurate diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is crucial for patient survival, and AI-human collaboration can enhance precision and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a HITL system where AI (EfficientNetV2S) provides initial diagnoses, humans review and correct results, and feedback refines the model iteratively.

Result: The system achieves 93.65% accuracy, outperforming existing methods, and further improves with human feedback.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration enhances IDC detection, offering a promising future for AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Result: Produces anatomically coherent synthetic images validated by perceptual metrics, expert evaluation, and improved diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enhances gynaecological AI research with realistic synthetic data, released with privacy safeguards for reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative MRI synthesis by embedding MRI sequence parameters into the model.

Method: A physics-driven neural network with parameter embedding for TR, TE, and TI, trained on healthy brain MR images and evaluated on internal/external datasets.

Result: High performance (PSNR >34 dB, SSIM >0.92), outperforming conventional models in accuracy and robustness, even for unseen pathological regions.

Conclusion: The method enhances quantitative MRI synthesis by leveraging physical principles, showing potential for clinical use.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

*Mohammed Salah,Numan Saeed,Davor Svetinovic,Stefano Sfarra,Mohammed Omar,Yusra Abdulrahman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a PCA-guided autoencoder for structured dimensionality reduction in AIRT data, improving defect characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoencoders for AIRT data lack structured latent spaces, limiting defect characterization.

Method: Introduces a PCA-guided autoencoder with a novel PCA distillation loss to align latent representations with structured PCA components.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in contrast, SNR, and neural network metrics.

Conclusion: The PCA-guided AE effectively captures non-linear features while enforcing a structured latent space, enhancing defect characterization.

Abstract: Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive
testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial
components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches
employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the
latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness
in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this
paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding
framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate,
non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured
latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to
guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA
components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic
signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we
propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability
for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed
PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on
PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
and neural network-based metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images often suffer from noise due to factors like low-dose scanning, affecting diagnosis accuracy. Enhancing image quality is critical for reliable clinical judgment.

Method: Proposes MI-ND with multi-scale convolution and Transformer, noise level estimator (NLE), and noise adaptive attention module (NAAB) for channel-spatial attention and cross-modal fusion.

Result: Outperforms others in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and improves F1 score and ROC-AUC in diagnostic tasks, showing strong practical value.

Conclusion: MI-ND excels in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, offering a viable solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality
directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such
as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical
images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously
affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a
medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale
convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator
(NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes
channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by
noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public
datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the
comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS,
and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing
strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding
benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal
robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement
and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in shallow water bathymetric mapping due to optical distortions like waves, scattering, and sunglint.

Method: Creation of a 1200-pair synthetic dataset (Sea-Undistort) with realistic water effects, used to benchmark and enhance image restoration methods, including a diffusion-based framework.

Result: The enhanced diffusion model improves seabed DSMs, reduces errors, and restores fine details in real aerial data.

Conclusion: Sea-Undistort enables effective supervised training and improves bathymetric mapping, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Accurate image-based bathymetric mapping in shallow waters remains
challenging due to the complex optical distortions such as wave induced
patterns, scattering and sunglint, introduced by the dynamic water surface, the
water column properties, and solar illumination. In this work, we introduce
Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512
through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free
and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint,
waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata
such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort
enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments.
We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration
methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an
early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced
diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the
seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses
glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details. Dataset,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional optimization-based methods struggle with nonlinearity and ill-posedness in MWT, while deep learning requires large datasets and lacks generalization.

Method: Proposes SSD-Reg, embedding diffusion priors into iterative reconstruction, combining physics and learned structural distributions.

Result: SSD-Reg enhances accuracy, stability, and robustness, recovering complex structures without paired data.

Conclusion: SSD-Reg offers a flexible, effective solution for ill-posed functional image reconstruction.

Abstract: Microwave Tomography (MWT) aims to reconstruct the dielectric properties of
tissues from measured scattered electromagnetic fields. This inverse problem is
highly nonlinear and ill-posed, posing significant challenges for conventional
optimization-based methods, which, despite being grounded in physical models,
often fail to recover fine structural details. Recent deep learning strategies,
including end-to-end and post-processing networks, have improved reconstruction
quality but typically require large paired training datasets and may struggle
to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we propose a physics-informed
hybrid framework that integrates diffusion models as learned regularization
within a data-consistency-driven variational scheme. Specifically, we introduce
Single-Step Diffusion Regularization (SSD-Reg), a novel approach that embeds
diffusion priors into the iterative reconstruction process, enabling the
recovery of complex anatomical structures without the need for paired data.
SSD-Reg maintains fidelity to both the governing physics and learned structural
distributions, improving accuracy, stability, and robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSD-Reg, implemented as a Plug-and-Play (PnP)
module, provides a flexible and effective solution for tackling the
ill-posedness inherent in functional image reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper proves tight approximation guarantees for HOSVD, ST-HOSVD, and HOOI, showing they achieve worst-case ratios of $N/(1+\varepsilon)$ and cannot be improved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To confirm the tightness of known approximation bounds for tensor decomposition methods (HOSVD, ST-HOSVD, HOOI) by constructing worst-case examples.

Method: Constructed specific tensors to demonstrate the worst-case performance of HOSVD, ST-HOSVD, and HOOI, matching their theoretical upper bounds.

Result: HOSVD, ST-HOSVD, and HOOI achieve their worst-case approximation ratios of $N/(1+\varepsilon)$, proving the bounds are tight.

Conclusion: The approximation guarantees for these tensor decomposition methods are optimal and cannot be further improved.

Abstract: We prove that the classic approximation guarantee for the higher-order
singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is tight by constructing a tensor for
which HOSVD achieves an approximation ratio of $N/(1+\varepsilon)$, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$. This matches the upper bound of De Lathauwer et al. (2000a)
and shows that the approximation ratio of HOSVD cannot be improved. Using a
more advanced construction, we also prove that the approximation guarantees for
the ST-HOSVD algorithm of Vannieuwenhoven et al. (2012) and higher-order
orthogonal iteration (HOOI) of De Lathauwer et al. (2000b) are tight by showing
that they can achieve their worst-case approximation ratio of $N / (1 +

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integer programming method to generate redistricting plans with more majority-minority districts, outperforming the heuristic 'short bursts' algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act requires plans with more majority-minority districts, as seen in cases like Allen v. Milligan.

Method: The method uses integer programming, building on stochastic hierarchical partitioning, and introduces new algorithms for local re-optimization and compactness.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the 'short bursts' algorithm in generating plans with more majority-minority districts.

Conclusion: The integer programming approach is more effective for creating fair redistricting plans with majority-minority districts.

Abstract: In redistricting litigation, effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act
has often involved providing the court with districting plans that display a
larger number of majority-minority districts than the current proposal (as was
true, for example, in what followed Allen v. Milligan concerning the
congressional districting plan for Alabama in 2023). Recent work by Cannon et
al. proposed a heuristic algorithm for generating plans to optimize
majority-minority districts, which they called short bursts; that algorithm
relies on a sophisticated random walk over the space of all plans,
transitioning in bursts, where the initial plan for each burst is the most
successful plan from the previous burst. We propose a method based on integer
programming, where we build upon another previous work, the stochastic
hierarchical partitioning algorithm, which heuristically generates a robust set
of potential districts (viewed as columns in a standard set partitioning
formulation); that approach was designed to optimize a different notion of
fairness across a statewide plan. We design a new column generation algorithm
to find plans via integer programming that outperforms short bursts on multiple
data sets in generating statewide plans with significantly more
majority-minority districts. These results also rely on a new local
re-optimization algorithm to iteratively improve on any baseline solution, as
well as an algorithm to increase the compactness of districts in plans
generated (without impacting the number of majority-minority districts).

Motivation: To characterize neural networks using statistical mechanics, inspired by replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses, and explore connections to network properties like generalization and robustness.

Method: Construct a Hopfield-type spin glass model from a feedforward neural network (FNN) and analyze overlaps between simulated replica samples.

Result: The method provides a computable descriptor for individual networks, uncovering structural properties not captured by conventional metrics like loss or accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detecting hidden vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural
networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin
glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given
feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples
serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the
spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as
data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated
and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on
model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual
network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not
captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results
suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection,
safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.

created BIGBOY1.2, an open synthetic dataset generator that creates
configurable epidemic time series and population-level trajectories suitable
for benchmarking modelling, forecasting, and visualisation. The framework
supports SEIR and SIR-like compartmental logic, custom seasonality, and noise
injection to mimic real reporting artifacts. BIGBOY1.2 can produce datasets
with diverse characteristics, making it suitable for comparing traditional
epidemiological models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) with modern machine learning
approaches (e.g., SVM, neural networks).

### [643] [A Score-based Diffusion Model Approach for Adaptive Learning of Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06834)
*Toan Huynh,Ruth Lopez Fajardo,Guannan Zhang,Lili Ju,Feng Bao*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: A novel framework uses score-based diffusion models for adaptive learning of SPDE solutions, addressing model errors and accuracy issues via recursive Bayesian inference and ensemble score filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPDEs model complex physical systems but suffer from inaccuracies due to incomplete knowledge and variability. The goal is to improve accuracy and adaptability.

Method: The framework encodes physics into a diffusion model's score function, uses observational data for likelihood-based correction, and introduces the ensemble score filter for efficiency.

Result: Numerical tests show the method's accuracy and robustness with sparse, noisy observations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively adapts to new data and improves SPDE solution accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving
solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using
score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting.
SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under
uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and
reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental
variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into
the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate
observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through
iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve
computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the
ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function
designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs
demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and
noisy observations.

TL;DR: Using interpretable ML (decision trees), the paper classifies Galois groups of extensions over Q via Dedekind zeta coefficients, revealing patterns and proving new classification criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how simple ML models can classify Galois groups and understand the relationship between zeta coefficients and group structure.

Method: Decision trees are applied to classify Galois groups of extensions (degrees 4,6,8,9,10) using Dedekind zeta coefficients.

Result: The study reveals how zeta coefficients' distribution relates to Galois groups and establishes new classification criteria.

Conclusion: This work exemplifies ML-driven mathematical research, advancing the understanding of Galois groups and their classification.

Abstract: By applying interpretable machine learning methods such as decision trees, we
study how simple models can classify the Galois groups of Galois extensions
over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degrees 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10, using Dedekind zeta
coefficients. Our interpretation of the machine learning results allows us to
understand how the distribution of zeta coefficients depends on the Galois
group, and to prove new criteria for classifying the Galois groups of these
extensions. Combined with previous results, this work provides another example
of a new paradigm in mathematical research driven by machine learning.

*John D. Mayfield*

Main category: q-bio.OT

TL;DR: A theoretical framework using quantum-classical hybrid computing and frequency-domain transformations is proposed to improve neurodegenerative disease analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns in neurodegenerative diseases, limiting predictive accuracy.

Method: Transform time-series data into frequency/s-domain, model dynamics with Hamiltonian formulations, and use quantum-classical hybrid computing (VQE) for pattern detection.

Result: The framework enables enhanced pattern detection and outlier analysis, with potential clinical applications like identifying high-risk patients.

Conclusion: This theoretical approach aims to redefine precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future empirical validation.

Abstract: Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),
multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge
deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and
neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting
predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that
transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and
Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and
employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum
eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct
serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis
of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations
with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in
multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture
entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages
quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling
outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical
applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or
therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine
learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's
classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the
groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases
through future validations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the expressive power of shallow neural networks in solving high-dimensional PDEs under structural assumptions.

Method: Analyzing the approximation complexity of second-order elliptic PDEs in Barron spaces using two-layer neural networks.

Result: Efficient approximation of PDE solutions by shallow networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality.

Conclusion: Shallow neural networks are effective for high-dimensional PDE solutions under Barron space assumptions.

Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order
elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube,
within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the
coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the
solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks,

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends a semigroup-based framework for error estimation in PINNs, making it applicable to a broader class of problems by modifying error bounds and approximating stability parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing PINN error estimators, which were restricted to academic examples, by enabling their use in more realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors modify the error bound and propose numerical strategies to approximate stability parameters, extending the semigroup-based framework.

Result: The extended framework successfully certifies PINN predictions in realistic scenarios, demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around a cylinder.

Conclusion: The work significantly broadens the applicability of PINN error estimation, enhancing its practical utility.

Abstract: Rigorous error estimation is a fundamental topic in numerical analysis. With
the increasing use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving
partial differential equations, several approaches have been developed to
quantify the associated prediction error. In this work, we build upon a
semigroup-based framework previously introduced by the authors for estimating
the PINN error. While this estimator has so far been limited to academic
examples - due to the need to compute quantities related to input-to-state
stability - we extend its applicability to a significantly broader class of
problems. This is accomplished by modifying the error bound and proposing
numerical strategies to approximate the required stability parameters. The
extended framework enables the certification of PINN predictions in more
realistic scenarios, as demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around
a cylinder.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: SEMNet, a Bayesian deep learning model, fills gaps in long-term solar EUV flux data using CaII K images, validated for 1998-2014 and extended to 1950-1960.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of long-term EUV flux data limits understanding of solar influences on Earth's atmosphere.

Method: Bayesian deep learning (SEMNet) applied to CaII K images for EUV flux reconstruction.

Result: SEMNet reliably predicts EUV flux with uncertainty bounds, validating CaII K images as a proxy.

Conclusion: SEMNet enables long-term EUV flux reconstruction, aiding solar-climate studies.

Abstract: Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating
the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric
dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent
studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little
work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar
cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995,
leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian
deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach
by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period
between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric
Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar
EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides
reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the
feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These
findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's
climate over extended periods.

Result: Identifies challenges and provides guidelines for adapting programming courses to AI tools.

Conclusion: AI tools can enhance programming education if integrated thoughtfully, addressing misuse and pedagogical needs.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into programming education has become

tools available for teaching and learning programming, particularly in the
context of introductory courses. It highlights the challenges on course design,

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores AI-driven tools to enhance Participatory Budgeting (PB) by improving proposal quality and transparency, using GPT 4 Turbo to predict funding outcomes based on text and historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low participation rates in PB limit its impact. The study aims to improve PB by aiding proposers and organizers with AI tools.

Method: A privacy-preserving approach uses textual descriptions and anonymous voting records to predict proposal outcomes, evaluated with GPT 4 Turbo.

Result: GPT 4 Turbo requires historical voting data to align predictions with real-world PB behavior, showing AI's potential to enhance PB.

Conclusion: AI tools can boost PB transparency, efficiency, and civic engagement by improving proposal predictions and management.

Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to propose and vote on public
investment projects. Yet, despite its democratic potential, PB initiatives
often suffer from low participation rates, limiting their visibility and
perceived legitimacy. In this work, we aim to strengthen PB elections in two
key ways: by supporting project proposers in crafting better proposals, and by
helping PB organizers manage large volumes of submissions in a transparent
manner. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to predict which PB proposals
are likely to be funded, using only their textual descriptions and anonymous
historical voting records -- without relying on voter demographics or
personally identifiable information. We evaluate the performance of GPT 4 Turbo
in forecasting proposal outcomes across varying contextual scenarios, observing
that the LLM's prior knowledge needs to be complemented by past voting data to
obtain predictions reflecting real-world PB voting behavior. Our findings
highlight the potential of AI-driven tools to support PB processes by improving
transparency, planning efficiency, and civic engagement.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated approach to AI alignment, combining behavioral and representational methods, inspired by immunology and cybersecurity, to address fragmentation and misalignment threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning AI models with human preferences is critical, but current approaches are fragmented, leading to vulnerabilities.

Method: The paper suggests Integrated Alignment frameworks, leveraging strategic diversity and adaptive coevolution, and promotes cross-collaboration and shared resources.

Result: The proposed framework aims to create more robust and adaptable AI alignment solutions by integrating diverse methods.

Conclusion: Unifying the AI alignment field through integrated frameworks and collaboration is essential for addressing misalignment threats effectively.

Abstract: As AI adoption expands across human society, the problem of aligning AI
models to match human preferences remains a grand challenge. Currently, the AI
alignment field is deeply divided between behavioral and representational
approaches, resulting in narrowly aligned models that are more vulnerable to
increasingly deceptive misalignment threats. In the face of this fragmentation,
we propose an integrated vision for the future of the field. Drawing on related
lessons from immunology and cybersecurity, we lay out a set of design
principles for the development of Integrated Alignment frameworks that combine
the complementary strengths of diverse alignment approaches through deep
integration and adaptive coevolution. We highlight the importance of strategic
diversity - deploying orthogonal alignment and misalignment detection
approaches to avoid homogeneous pipelines that may be "doomed to success". We
also recommend steps for greater unification of the AI alignment research field
itself, through cross-collaboration, open model weights and shared community
resources.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for integrating lived experiences into AI design and evaluation, emphasizing their impact on safety, trust, and usability. It synthesizes interdisciplinary insights and provides actionable recommendations for empathetic, context-aware AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research lacks systematic understanding of lived human experiences in AI development. The paper aims to bridge this gap by centering lived experiences to create more human-aligned AI systems.

Method: The framework synthesizes literature from lived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction. It includes a taxonomy of lived experiences and examines three domains (education, healthcare, cultural alignment) to illustrate practical applications.

Result: The paper presents a framework for experience-centered AI systems, highlighting challenges like responsibility allocation and mental model calibration. It offers actionable recommendations for empathetic and context-aware AI.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for future research, advocating for AI systems that are technically robust and aligned with human realities through lived experience integration.

Abstract: Lived experiences fundamentally shape how individuals interact with AI
systems, influencing perceptions of safety, trust, and usability. While prior
research has focused on developing techniques to emulate human preferences, and
proposed taxonomies to categorize risks (such as psychological harms and
algorithmic biases), these efforts have provided limited systematic
understanding of lived human experiences or actionable strategies for embedding
them meaningfully into the AI development lifecycle. This work proposes a
framework for meaningfully integrating lived experience into the design and
evaluation of AI systems. We synthesize interdisciplinary literature across
lived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction,
arguing that centering lived experience can lead to models that more accurately
reflect the retrospective, emotional, and contextual dimensions of human
cognition. Drawing from a wide body of work across psychology, education,
healthcare, and social policy, we present a targeted taxonomy of lived
experiences with specific applicability to AI systems. To ground our framework,
we examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii)
cultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals,
system expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further
incorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to
highlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration,
and long-term system adaptation. We conclude with actionable recommendations
for developing experience-centered AI systems that are not only technically
robust but also empathetic, context-aware, and aligned with human realities.
This work offers a foundation for future research that bridges technical
development with the lived experiences of those impacted by AI systems.

Motivation: To explore a positive, human-centered technological future through cybernetic principles and digital participation.

Method: Combined visual art with cybernetic concepts (adaptation, feedback, control) and early machine learning over a live network.

Result: Demonstrated behavior's impact on systems, offering a historical precedent for AI-driven, human-centered art.

Conclusion: Ecogame's approach remains relevant for contemporary AI art, emphasizing participation and democratization.

Abstract: This paper considers Ecogame, an innovative art project of 1970, whose
creators believed in a positive vision of a technological future; an
understanding, posited on cybernetics, of a future that could be participatory
via digital means, and therefore more democratised. Using simulation and early
machine learning techniques over a live network, Ecogame combined the power of
visual art with cybernetic concepts of adaptation, feedback, and control to
propose that behaviour had implications for the total system. It provides an
historical precedent for contemporary AI-driven art about using AI in a more

Motivation: To investigate how generative AI models like ChatGPT4o depict museum curators and whether these representations align with or diverge from reality.

Method: Analysis of 230 AI-generated visualizations of museum curators, comparing them to real-world demographic data.

Result: AI images underrepresent women (3.5% vs 49-72%) and non-Caucasian ethnicities (0% vs 18-36%), overrepresent youth (79% vs ~27%), and depict curators as yuppie professionals with stereotypical attributes.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant biases in AI-generated imagery, which could perpetuate inaccurate portrayals of museum professionals if uncritically accepted.

Abstract: Based on 230 visualisations, this paper examines the depiction of museum
curators by the popular generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model,
ChatGPT4o. While the AI-generated representations do not reiterate popular
stereotypes of curators as nerdy, conservative in dress and stuck in time
rummaging through collections, they contrast sharply with real-world
demographics. AI-generated imagery extremely underrepresents women (3.5% vs 49%
to 72% in reality) and disregards ethnic communities other than Caucasian (0%
vs 18% to 36%). It only over-represents young curators (79% vs approx. 27%) but
also renders curators to resemble yuppie professionals or people featuring in
fashion advertising. Stereotypical attributes are prevalent, with curators
widely depicted as wearing beards and holding clipboards or digital tablets.
The findings highlight biases in the generative AI image creation dataset,
which is poised to shape an inaccurate portrayal of museum professionals if the
images were to be taken uncritically at face value.

Motivation: To address the difficulties in validating and integrating knowledge across distinct epistemic and ontological perspectives in transdisciplinary research, particularly in AI and urban studies.

Method: The framework classifies research orientations into six dimensions: ontological, epistemological, methodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization, based on an analysis of highly cited research (2014-2024).

Result: Findings reveal a predominance of critical realism, positivism, analytical methods, consequentialism, epistemic values, and social/economic valorization, with less common stances like idealism and mixed methods also explored.

Conclusion: The framework aids early career researchers and transdisciplinary teams in reconciling divergent viewpoints and fostering socially accountable outcomes.

Abstract: Transdisciplinary approaches are increasingly essential for addressing grand
societal challenges, particularly in complex domains such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), urban planning, and social sciences. However, effectively
validating and integrating knowledge across distinct epistemic and ontological
perspectives poses significant difficulties. This article proposes a
six-dimensional framework for assessing and strengthening transdisciplinary
knowledge validity in AI and city studies, based on an extensive analysis of
the most cited research (2014--2024). Specifically, the framework classifies
research orientations according to ontological, epistemological,
methodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization dimensions. Our
findings show a predominance of perspectives aligned with critical realism
(ontological), positivism (epistemological), analytical methods
(methodological), consequentialism (teleological), epistemic values
(axiological), and social/economic valorization. Less common stances, such as
idealism, mixed methods, and cultural valorization, are also examined for their
potential to enrich knowledge production. We highlight how early career
researchers and transdisciplinary teams can leverage this framework to
reconcile divergent disciplinary viewpoints and promote socially accountable
outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes uncertainty in AI predictions and its legal/ethical challenges, comparing selective abstention and selective friction as interventions to mitigate risks, highlighting discriminatory impacts and advocating for selective friction for fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the legal and ethical challenges posed by uncertainty in AI predictions, particularly its potential to exacerbate disparities and disadvantage underrepresented groups.

Method: Integrated socio-technical and legal analysis, supported by case studies on AI-assisted consumer credit decisions and content moderation.

Result: Uncertainty thresholds can trigger discriminatory impacts; selective friction is less harmful than selective abstention and promotes fairness.

Conclusion: Selective friction is a preferable intervention for fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making, despite risks under UK law.

Abstract: Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (AI) predictions poses urgent legal
and ethical challenges for AI-assisted decision-making. We examine two
algorithmic interventions that act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration:
selective abstention, which withholds high-uncertainty predictions from human
decision-makers, and selective friction, which delivers those predictions
together with salient warnings or disclosures that slow the decision process.
Research has shown that selective abstention based on uncertainty can
inadvertently exacerbate disparities and disadvantage under-represented groups
that disproportionately receive uncertain predictions. In this paper, we
provide the first integrated socio-technical and legal analysis of
uncertainty-based algorithmic interventions. Through two case studies,
AI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we
demonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger
discriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks
of unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising
pathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by
preserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT methods struggle with correlation conflicts between historical learning sequences and future performance, limiting accuracy.

Method: FINER extracts FPTs from historical data, uses a similarity-aware attention mechanism, and combines FPTs with learning sequences for prediction.

Result: FINER outperforms ten state-of-the-art KT methods, improving accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85% on six datasets.

Conclusion: FINER effectively addresses correlation conflicts and enhances KT accuracy by leveraging FPTs and advanced attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses,
offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems,
knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their
historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students'
knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter
correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical
learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we
propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from
historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called
Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning
sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER
constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from
historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware
attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual
similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning
sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten
state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the readiness of AI systems for high-stakes societal decision-making, focusing on homelessness resource allocation.

Method: Analysis using real data on service needs, comparing LLM judgments with human judgments and vulnerability scoring systems.

Result: LLM prioritizations are inconsistent internally, between models, and with scoring systems, but align qualitatively with lay human judgments.

Conclusion: Current AI systems are not yet ready for naive integration into high-stakes societal decision-making.

Abstract: A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of
large-scale AI models that make "moral" judgments. Much of this literature
focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought
experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the
most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called
street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social
resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how
principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization
mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments
align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined
vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness
resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services
(maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to
perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely
inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different
LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time,
LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise
testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI
systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.

Conclusion: LLMs can transform narrative analysis, with Story Ribbons demonstrating their potential, though challenges remain for AI-based systems.

Abstract: Analyzing literature involves tracking interactions between characters,
locations, and themes. Visualization has the potential to facilitate the
mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured
information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language
models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text
processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing
storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an
LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative
information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create
Story Ribbons, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert
literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple
narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with Story
Ribbons on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to
streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about
familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and
interaction motifs designed to address these issues.

*Baihan Lin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conversational DNA, a visual language for analyzing dialogue patterns using biological metaphors, revealing deeper insights than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover hidden patterns in dialogue that traditional statistical summaries miss, especially in human-AI communication.

Method: Uses biological metaphors (e.g., strand thickness, color gradients) to visualize dialogue structure, applied to therapeutic and human-AI conversations.

Result: Reveals interaction patterns overlooked by traditional methods, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Provides a novel, creative framework for understanding meaningful dialogue in human-AI interactions, bridging visualization and communication studies.

Abstract: What if the patterns hidden within dialogue reveal more about communication
than the words themselves? We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual
language that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and
AI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can
be visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation
analysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach
reveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors.
Linguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories
cascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through
connecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through
helical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and
historically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this
visualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods
miss. Our work contributes a new creative framework for understanding
communication that bridges data visualization, human-computer interaction, and
the fundamental question of what makes dialogue meaningful in an age where
humans increasingly converse with artificial minds.

*Hyo Jin Do,Rachel Ostrand,Werner Geyer,Keerthiram Murugesan,Dennis Wei,Justin Weisz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores design strategies for communicating factuality scores in LLM outputs, finding color-coding phrases by factuality scores most effective for user trust and accuracy validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on effectively communicating hallucinated or inaccurate information generated by LLMs to users.

Method: Conducted two scenario-based experiments with 208 participants to compare design strategies for displaying factuality scores.

Result: Participants preferred and trusted color-coded factuality scores, finding it easier to validate response accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides practical design guidelines to improve user trust and scrutiny of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating inaccurate or
false information, often referred to as "hallucinations" or "confabulations."
While several technical advancements have been made to detect hallucinated
content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses, there is still
limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users.
To address this gap, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with a total
of 208 participants to systematically compare the effects of various design
strategies for communicating factuality scores by assessing participants'
ratings of trust, ease in validating response accuracy, and preference. Our
findings reveal that participants preferred and trusted a design in which all
phrases within a response were color-coded based on factuality scores.
Participants also found it easier to validate accuracy of the response in this
style compared to a baseline with no style applied. Our study offers practical
design guidelines for LLM application developers and designers, aimed at
calibrating user trust, aligning with user preferences, and enhancing users'
ability to scrutinize LLM outputs.

### [662] [Hide or Highlight: Understanding the Impact of Factuality Expression on User Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07095)
*Hyo Jin Do,Werner Geyer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how disclosing factuality assessments in AI outputs affects user trust, finding that hiding or making less factual content vague increases trust without compromising perceived quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how revealing or hiding factually incorrect content in AI-generated outputs influences user trust, as blind trust in AI can lead to erroneous decisions.

Method: Tested four disclosure strategies (transparent, attention, opaque, ambiguity) against a baseline in question-answering scenarios with 148 human subjects.

Result: Opaque (removing less factual content) and ambiguity (making it vague) strategies led to higher trust while maintaining perceived answer quality.

Conclusion: Hiding or obscuring less factual content is effective for building user trust in AI-generated outputs.

Abstract: Large language models are known to produce outputs that are plausible but
factually incorrect. To prevent people from making erroneous decisions by
blindly trusting AI, researchers have explored various ways of communicating
factuality estimates in AI-generated outputs to end-users. However, little is
known about whether revealing content estimated to be factually incorrect
influences users' trust when compared to hiding it altogether. We tested four
different ways of disclosing an AI-generated output with factuality
assessments: transparent (highlights less factual content), attention
(highlights factual content), opaque (removes less factual content), ambiguity
(makes less factual content vague), and compared them with a baseline response
without factuality information. We conducted a human subjects research (N =
148) using the strategies in question-answering scenarios. We found that the
opaque and ambiguity strategies led to higher trust while maintaining perceived
answer quality, compared to the other strategies. We discuss the efficacy of
hiding presumably less factual content to build end-user trust.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores policymakers' openness to AI in homelessness housing resource matching, highlighting potential benefits and challenges in efficiency, fairness, and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how AI-driven algorithms for housing resource matching are adopted by practitioners and their consequences.

Method: Semi-structured interviews with 13 policymakers in homeless services in Los Angeles.

Result: Policymakers are open to AI tools if designed thoughtfully and used alongside human decision-makers, though design specifics remain unclear.

Conclusion: Insights from policymakers provide valuable considerations for future responsible AI systems in low-resource decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence researchers have proposed various data-driven
algorithms to improve the processes that match individuals experiencing
homelessness to scarce housing resources. It remains unclear whether and how
these algorithms are received or adopted by practitioners and what their
corresponding consequences are. Through semi-structured interviews with 13
policymakers in homeless services in Los Angeles, we investigate whether such
change-makers are open to the idea of integrating AI into the housing resource
matching process, identifying where they see potential gains and drawbacks from
such a system in issues of efficiency, fairness, and transparency. Our
qualitative analysis indicates that, even when aware of various complicating
factors, policymakers welcome the idea of an AI matching tool if thoughtfully
designed and used in tandem with human decision-makers. Though there is no
consensus as to the exact design of such an AI system, insights from
policymakers raise open questions and design considerations that can be
enlightening for future researchers and practitioners who aim to build
responsible algorithmic systems to support decision-making in low-resource
scenarios.

### [664] [ClimateSOM: A Visual Analysis Workflow for Climate Ensemble Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06732)
*Yuya Kawakami,Daniel Cayan,Dongyu Liu,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ClimateSOM is a visual analysis workflow using SOM and LLMs to explore variability in climate ensemble datasets, demonstrated with precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern U.S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for understanding variability among climate ensemble model runs, which are similar yet distinct, and to aid in their analysis.

Method: Leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) to abstract ensemble model runs into a 2D space and integrates LLMs for sensemaking, enabling interactive exploration, pattern identification, and clustering.

Result: Applied to precipitation projections, ClimateSOM successfully aids in exploring variability and identifying patterns, validated through expert review.

Conclusion: ClimateSOM effectively supports climate scientists in analyzing ensemble datasets, with LLM integration enhancing sensemaking and utility.

Abstract: Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In
climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in
projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol
emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally
similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among
ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task
for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis
workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate
ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs -
spatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures
the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated
to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual
analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability
among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble
model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to
an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the
Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our
LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the
insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach
and its utility.

*Ahmed M. Abuzuraiq,Philippe Pasquier*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how Explainable AI (XAI) can enhance artistic engagement by making large generative models transparent and manipulable, using a craft-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower artists with greater agency and control over large-scale generative models, which often lack transparency.

Method: A craft-based approach inspired by Sch"on's "reflection-in-action," implemented via a model-bending and inspection plugin in ComfyUI.

Result: Artists can intuitively understand and manipulate model components to influence outputs.

Conclusion: Exposing and making large models manipulable can transform them into creative materials for artists.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in creative contexts can go beyond transparency to
support artistic engagement, modifiability, and sustained practice. While
curated datasets and training human-scale models can offer artists greater
agency and control, large-scale generative models like text-to-image diffusion
systems often obscure these possibilities. We suggest that even large models
can be treated as creative materials if their internal structure is exposed and
manipulable. We propose a craft-based approach to explainability rooted in
long-term, hands-on engagement akin to Sch\"on's "reflection-in-action" and
demonstrate its application through a model-bending and inspection plugin
integrated into the node-based interface of ComfyUI. We demonstrate that by
interactively manipulating different parts of a generative model, artists can
develop an intuition about how each component influences the output.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study combines EEG microstates and LLMs to better assess cognitive load states ('Rest' and 'Load'), achieving improved predictions through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cognitive load assessment by integrating EEG microstate features with LLMs for more accurate state discrimination.

Method: Four stages: dataset preprocessing, EEG microstate segmentation, feature extraction with prompt engineering, and LLM fine-tuning using supervised learning.

Result: Significant improvement in model performance, demonstrating EEG-informed LLMs' potential in cognitive neuroscience and AI.

Conclusion: The approach advances understanding of brain dynamics and machine learning techniques for cognitive load and AI research.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG)
microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of
cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims
to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states,
specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four
comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate
segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt
engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a
supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load
states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing
accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG
features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental
framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance
following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed
LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not
only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way
for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load
and cognitive AI research.

*Gustavo Moreira,Leonardo Ferreira,Carolina Veiga,Maryam Hosseini,Fabio Miranda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Urbanite is a framework for human-AI collaboration in urban visual analytics, leveraging intent-based interaction and dataflow models to lower barriers for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of urban data analysis and the high barrier for non-experts necessitate tools that simplify intent-based interaction and ensure alignment between user intent and system outcomes.

Method: Urbanite uses a dataflow-based model to enable intent specification at multiple scopes, supporting explainability, multi-resolution task definition, and interaction provenance.

Result: Urbanite effectively bridges gaps between user intent and system behavior, demonstrated through usage scenarios with urban experts.

Conclusion: Urbanite offers a promising solution for democratizing urban visual analytics by facilitating human-AI collaboration and intent-driven workflows.

Abstract: With the growing availability of urban data and the increasing complexity of
societal challenges, visual analytics has become essential for deriving
insights into pressing real-world problems. However, analyzing such data is
inherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains.
The need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate
various analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for
researchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine
learning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a
promising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics
systems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise
computational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to
intent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout
the design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge
between user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these
challenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in
urban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows
users to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment
across the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics.
Based on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates
features to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks
across dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of
interactions. We demonstrate Urbanite's effectiveness through usage scenarios
created in collaboration with urban experts. Urbanite is available at

TL;DR: VA-Blueprint is a methodology and knowledge base for systematically categorizing and organizing the building blocks of urban visual analytics (VA) systems, aiding structured development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical challenges of developing VA systems are underexplored, lacking structured knowledge bases despite their growing number.

Method: Proposes VA-Blueprint, a methodology to review and categorize VA system components, applied to 20 systems initially and scaled to 101 papers using a large language model.

Result: Identifies and organizes core components into a multi-level structure, forming a knowledge base. Evaluated via expert interviews and quantitative analysis.

Conclusion: VA-Blueprint enhances understanding of VA systems' composition and supports structured, reproducible, and efficient development.

Abstract: Designing and building visual analytics (VA) systems is a complex, iterative
process that requires the seamless integration of data processing, analytics
capabilities, and visualization techniques. While prior research has
extensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system
authoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain
underexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are
only a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To
tackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that
systematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban
VA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate
data and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20
systems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level
structure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA
system development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to
automate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a
corpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base
construction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a
quantitative analysis of annotation metrics. Our contributions provide a deeper
understanding of VA systems' composition and establish a practical foundation
to support more structured, reproducible, and efficient system development.

*Sarah Jabbour,David Fouhey,Nikola Banovic,Stephanie D. Shepard,Ella Kazerooni,Michael W. Sjoding,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Selective prediction in AI-assisted decision-making mitigates accuracy decline from inaccurate AI but alters mistake patterns, increasing underdiagnosis and undertreatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that selective prediction prevents worse human decisions by hiding unreliable AI predictions.

Method: A user study with 259 clinicians diagnosing and treating patients, comparing baseline performance, AI assistance, and selective prediction.

Result: Selective prediction recovers accuracy (64%) compared to inaccurate AI (56%), but increases missed diagnoses (18%) and treatments (35%).

Conclusion: Empirical validation of human-AI interaction assumptions is crucial, as selective prediction affects decision patterns despite maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: AI has the potential to augment human decision making. However, even
high-performing models can produce inaccurate predictions when deployed. These
inaccuracies, combined with automation bias, where humans overrely on AI
predictions, can result in worse decisions. Selective prediction, in which
potentially unreliable model predictions are hidden from users, has been
proposed as a solution. This approach assumes that when AI abstains and informs
the user so, humans make decisions as they would without AI involvement. To
test this assumption, we study the effects of selective prediction on human
decisions in a clinical context. We conducted a user study of 259 clinicians
tasked with diagnosing and treating hospitalized patients. We compared their
baseline performance without any AI involvement to their AI-assisted accuracy
with and without selective prediction. Our findings indicate that selective
prediction mitigates the negative effects of inaccurate AI in terms of decision
accuracy. Compared to no AI assistance, clinician accuracy declined when shown
inaccurate AI predictions (66% [95% CI: 56%-75%] vs. 56% [95% CI: 46%-66%]),
but recovered under selective prediction (64% [95% CI: 54%-73%]). However,
while selective prediction nearly maintains overall accuracy, our results
suggest that it alters patterns of mistakes: when informed the AI abstains,
clinicians underdiagnose (18% increase in missed diagnoses) and undertreat (35%
increase in missed treatments) compared to no AI input at all. Our findings
underscore the importance of empirically validating assumptions about how
humans engage with AI within human-AI systems.

TL;DR: CognitiveArm is a real-time, EEG-driven prosthetic control system using optimized deep learning models on embedded AI hardware, achieving 90% accuracy for core actions and supporting voice commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, non-invasive prosthetic limb control via BCIs on resource-constrained devices, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Integrates BrainFlow for EEG data, uses evolutionary search for Pareto-optimal DL models, applies model compression (pruning, quantization), and includes voice command support.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy for classifying three core actions (left, right, idle) and enables multiplexed movement for real-world tasks.

Conclusion: CognitiveArm demonstrates potential for advanced prosthetic control with low latency, real-time operation, and seamless mode switching.

Abstract: Efficient control of prosthetic limbs via non-invasive brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) requires advanced EEG processing, including pre-filtering,
feature extraction, and action prediction, performed in real time on edge AI
hardware. Achieving this on resource-constrained devices presents challenges in
balancing model complexity, computational efficiency, and latency. We present
CognitiveArm, an EEG-driven, brain-controlled prosthetic system implemented on
embedded AI hardware, achieving real-time operation without compromising
accuracy. The system integrates BrainFlow, an open-source library for EEG data
acquisition and streaming, with optimized deep learning (DL) models for precise
brain signal classification. Using evolutionary search, we identify
Pareto-optimal DL configurations through hyperparameter tuning, optimizer
analysis, and window selection, analyzed individually and in ensemble
configurations. We apply model compression techniques such as pruning and
quantization to optimize models for embedded deployment, balancing efficiency
and accuracy. We collected an EEG dataset and designed an annotation pipeline
enabling precise labeling of brain signals corresponding to specific intended
actions, forming the basis for training our optimized DL models. CognitiveArm
also supports voice commands for seamless mode switching, enabling control of
the prosthetic arm's 3 degrees of freedom (DoF). Running entirely on embedded
hardware, it ensures low latency and real-time responsiveness. A full-scale
prototype, interfaced with the OpenBCI UltraCortex Mark IV EEG headset,
achieved up to 90% accuracy in classifying three core actions (left, right,
idle). Voice integration enables multiplexed, variable movement for everyday
tasks (e.g., handshake, cup picking), enhancing real-world performance and
demonstrating CognitiveArm's potential for advanced prosthetic control.

TL;DR: A study explored ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agents for natural driver-agent interaction, showing improved driving performance and user experience compared to pre-scripted agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional in-vehicle agents rely on pre-scripted prompts, limiting natural interaction. This study aims to enhance driver-agent dialogue using ChatGPT.

Method: Forty drivers tested three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, ChatGPT-based agent) in a driving simulator, measuring driving performance and subjective feedback.

Result: ChatGPT-based agents improved driving stability (lower variability in acceleration and lane deviation) and received higher ratings in competence, trust, and preference.

Conclusion: LLM-powered agents like ChatGPT can enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

Abstract: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on
pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural
driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the
potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous,
multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a
motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent,
Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable.
Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable
driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower
variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane
deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the
ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence,
animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent.
Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse
interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions,
entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight
the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance
driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Users often overlook AI explanations in decision support systems, reducing their effectiveness in catching errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why users may not carefully consider AI explanations, impacting trust and error prevention.

Method: An online study on trust in explainable decision support systems, analyzing participant behavior with AI explanations.

Result: Participants frequently spent little time on explanations, affecting their openness to AI suggestions.

Conclusion: Improving user engagement with explanations is crucial for effective human oversight in AI decision-making.

Abstract: In the context of AI-based decision support systems, explanations can help
users to judge when to trust the AI's suggestion, and when to question it. In
this way, human oversight can prevent AI errors and biased decision-making.
However, this rests on the assumption that users will consider explanations in
enough detail to be able to catch such errors. We conducted an online study on
trust in explainable DSS, and were surprised to find that in many cases,
participants spent little time on the explanation and did not always consider
it in detail. We present an exploratory analysis of this data, investigating
what factors impact how carefully study participants consider AI explanations,
and how this in turn impacts whether they are open to changing their mind based
on what the AI suggests.

TL;DR: A universal ASR context-biasing framework is proposed, supporting CTC, Transducers, and Attention Encoder-Decoder models, with high efficiency and no speed degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context-biasing approaches have limitations like additional training, slow decoding, or restricted ASR system types.

Method: Uses a GPU-accelerated word boosting tree for shallow fusion with greedy and beam search decoding.

Result: Surpasses open-source approaches in accuracy and speed, handling up to 20K key phrases.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient, versatile, and open-sourced in the NeMo toolkit.

Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing
approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model
training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice
of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing
framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention
Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word
boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy
and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast
number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high
efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source
context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing

Conclusion: FlexCTC is a user-friendly, extensible alternative to traditional decoders, fully leveraging GPU capabilities.

Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding,
standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully
leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC
toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal

Conclusion: G-IFT effectively improves SV performance for children's speech by efficiently transferring knowledge from adult speech.

Abstract: Speaker Verification (SV) systems trained on adults speech often underperform
on children's SV due to the acoustic mismatch, and limited children speech data
makes fine-tuning not very effective. In this paper, we propose an innovative
framework, a Gated Linear Unit adapter with Iterative Fine-Tuning (G-IFT), to
enhance knowledge transfer efficiency between the high-resource adults speech
domain and the low-resource children's speech domain. In this framework, a
Gated Linear Unit adapter is first inserted between the pre-trained speaker
embedding model and the classifier. Then the classifier, adapter, and
pre-trained speaker embedding model are optimized sequentially in an iterative
way. This framework is agnostic to the type of the underlying architecture of
the SV system. Our experiments on ECAPA-TDNN, ResNet, and X-vector
architectures using the OGI and MyST datasets demonstrate that the G-IFT
framework yields consistent reductions in Equal Error Rates compared to
baseline methods.

*Ivan Kukanov,Jun Wah Ng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for detecting and localizing deepfakes, combining handcrafted visual features and self-supervised audio learning, achieving high performance on the AV-Deepfake1M++ dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of advanced audio-driven talking head generators and TTS models necessitates robust deepfake detection methods that generalize to unseen attacks and are computationally efficient.

Method: Uses handcrafted visual features for interpretability and a self-supervised learning backbone with graph attention networks for audio, balancing performance and deployment feasibility.

Result: Achieves 92.78% AUC for deepfake classification and 0.3536 IoU for temporal localization using audio alone on AV-Deepfake1M++.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach effectively addresses generalization and computational challenges in deepfake detection, offering resilience and interpretability.

Abstract: The rapid development of audio-driven talking head generators and advanced
Text-To-Speech (TTS) models has led to more sophisticated temporal deepfakes.
These advances highlight the need for robust methods capable of detecting and
localizing deepfakes, even under novel, unseen attack scenarios. Current
state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, while accurate, are often computationally
expensive and struggle to generalize to novel manipulation techniques. To
address these challenges, we propose multimodal approaches for the
AV-Deepfake1M 2025 challenge. For the visual modality, we leverage handcrafted
features to improve interpretability and adaptability. For the audio modality,
we adapt a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone coupled with graph attention
networks to capture rich audio representations, improving detection robustness.
Our approach strikes a balance between performance and real-world deployment,
focusing on resilience and potential interpretability. On the AV-Deepfake1M++
dataset, our multimodal system achieves AUC of 92.78% for deepfake
classification task and IoU of 0.3536 for temporal localization using only the
audio modality.

### [677] [Auditory Intelligence: Understanding the World Through Sound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07829)
*Hyeonuk Nam*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reframing of auditory intelligence to include deeper understanding (beyond surface-level recognition) through four new task paradigms: ASPIRE, SODA, AUX, and AUGMENT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auditory intelligence systems excel in tasks like sound event detection but lack deeper understanding (e.g., reasoning, context). The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduces four cognitively inspired task paradigms: ASPIRE (time-frequency pattern captioning), SODA (hierarchical event/scene description), AUX (causal explanation), and AUGMENT (goal-driven interpretation).

Result: The proposed paradigms aim to enhance generalizability, explainability, and alignment with human auditory understanding.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a layered, situated approach to auditory intelligence, encouraging broader discussions on machine understanding of sound.

Abstract: Recent progress in auditory intelligence has yielded high-performing systems
for sound event detection (SED), acoustic scene classification (ASC), automated
audio captioning (AAC), and audio question answering (AQA). Yet these tasks
remain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened
but not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a
conceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process
that encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this
view, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX,
and AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency
pattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation,
and goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide
a roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory
intelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it
means for machines to understand sound.

*Mohammed-Khalil Ghali,Cecil Pang,Oscar Molina,Carlos Gershenson-Garcia,Daehan Won*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: A hybrid forecasting framework combining historical commodity price data and semantic signals from global economic news, using AI, outperforms traditional methods in predicting price spikes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is crucial for countries with limited economic buffers to mitigate budget strains and ensure food and energy security.

Method: The framework integrates dual-stream LSTM networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series data and semantically embedded news summaries from 1960 to 2023.

Result: The model achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and accuracy of 0.91, significantly outperforming traditional methods like logistic regression (AUC = 0.34). Removing news data causes a steep performance drop (AUC = 0.46).

Conclusion: Integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning enhances early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with
limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets,
disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This
paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical
commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news,
using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates
dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to
fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked
news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year
dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned
news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of
0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional
baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57),
and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal
that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate
declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep
drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating
real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that
integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve
early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for
economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while
saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper presents an improved exponential tail bound for Beta
distributions, refining a result in [15]. This improvement is achieved by
interpreting their bound as a regular Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence one,
while introducing a specific perturbation $\eta$ that shifts the mean of the
Beta distribution closer to zero within the KL bound. Our contribution is to
show that a larger perturbation can be chosen, thereby tightening the bound. We
then extend this result from the Beta distribution to Dirichlet distributions
and Dirichlet processes (DPs).

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: Self-replication in cellular automata can emerge spontaneously and in distributed, multi-component forms, challenging traditional notions of individuality in artificial life.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that self-replicating structures in cellular automata can arise without artificial design or initialization, and to explore their distributed nature.

Method: A data-driven framework reconstructs causal ancestry of patterns in the Outlier rule, identifying self-replicators via explicit causal lineages.

Result: Self-replicators in the Outlier CA are spontaneous, robust, and often involve coordinated multi-component clusters.

Conclusion: The findings challenge conventional views of individuality and replication in artificial life systems.

Abstract: Spontaneous self-replication in cellular automata has long been considered
rare, with most known examples requiring careful design or artificial
initialization. In this paper, we present formal, causal evidence that such
replication can emerge unassisted -- and that it can do so in a distributed,
multi-component form. Building on prior work identifying complex dynamics in
the Outlier rule, we introduce a data-driven framework that reconstructs the
full causal ancestry of patterns in a deterministic cellular automaton. This
allows us to rigorously identify self-replicating structures via explicit
causal lineages. Our results show definitively that self-replicators in the
Outlier CA are not only spontaneous and robust, but are also often composed of
multiple disjoint clusters working in coordination, raising questions about
some conventional notions of individuality and replication in artificial life
systems.

TL;DR: LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins) integrate LLMs to extract and organize unstructured knowledge into ontologies, enhancing digital twins for infrastructure planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating unstructured knowledge into Digital Twins (DTs) to improve their effectiveness in complex infrastructure management.

Method: Proposing LSDTs, a framework using LLMs to extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents (e.g., regulations, guidelines) and organize it into a formal ontology for digital twins.

Result: LSDTs demonstrated interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization and high-fidelity simulation in offshore wind farm planning, including during Hurricane Sandy.

Conclusion: Combining generative AI (LLMs) with digital twins shows promise for supporting complex, knowledge-driven infrastructure planning tasks.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) offer powerful tools for managing complex infrastructure
systems, but their effectiveness is often limited by challenges in integrating
unstructured knowledge. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring
new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and
organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs
(LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract
planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations
and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology
forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the
physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning
scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm
planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results
demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout
optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in
infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative
AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.

*Kalana Wijegunarathna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Omni is a geospatial ER model with an omni-geometry encoder for diverse geometries, outperforming existing methods by 12% (F1). LLMs also show competitive results in geospatial ER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geospatial ER methods overlook diverse geometries and lose spatial information by simplifying them to points.

Method: Omni uses an omni-geometry encoder for diverse geometries and transformer-based pre-trained language models for textual attributes.

Result: Omni improves F1 by 12% over existing methods. LLMs also perform competitively in geospatial ER.

Conclusion: Omni addresses the limitation of diverse geometry handling, and LLMs show promise for geospatial ER.

Abstract: The development, integration, and maintenance of geospatial databases rely
heavily on efficient and accurate matching procedures of Geospatial Entity
Resolution (ER). While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely
addressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely
overlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding
heterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing
neural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in
significant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose
Omni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is
capable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon
geometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of
the places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based
pre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records
in an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing
point-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni
produces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.
  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct
geospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios,
comparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs.
Results indicate that LLMs show competitive results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance text-to-SQL systems by enabling query mapping across schemas, improving in-context learning.

Method: Developed SQL-Exchange framework to map queries, evaluated feasibility, and impact on text-to-SQL performance.

Result: Effective across schemas and query types, mapped queries improve text-to-SQL performance over source queries.

Conclusion: SQL-Exchange is a viable solution for cross-schema query mapping and boosts text-to-SQL system performance.

Abstract: We introduce SQL-Exchange, a framework for mapping SQL queries across
different database schemas by preserving the source query structure while
adapting domain-specific elements to align with the target schema. We
investigate the conditions under which such mappings are feasible and
beneficial, and examine their impact on enhancing the in-context learning
performance of text-to-SQL systems as a downstream task. Our comprehensive
evaluation across multiple model families and benchmark datasets--assessing
structural alignment with source queries, execution validity on target
databases, and semantic correctness--demonstrates that SQL-Exchange is
effective across a wide range of schemas and query types. Our results further
show that using mapped queries as in-context examples consistently improves
text-to-SQL performance over using queries from the source schema.

*William Zerong Wang,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy challenges in music data embeddings, proposing an efficient Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) solution for vector similarity search, balancing privacy and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music data's temporal and multimodal nature makes its embeddings vulnerable to misuse. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital watermarking are insufficient, and standard encryption or Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) are impractical.

Method: The paper analyzes threat models, proposes an AHE-based solution using inner products of music embeddings for privacy-preserving similarity search, and evaluates its efficiency empirically.

Result: The proposed AHE approach is shown to be efficient and practical for large-scale vector similarity searches, outperforming FHE schemes in real-world MP3 file evaluations.

Conclusion: AHE provides a viable, efficient solution for protecting music embeddings while enabling practical similarity searches, addressing the limitations of traditional and FHE methods.

Abstract: In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents
unique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is
inherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed
at an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector
embeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible
to being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the
original audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital
watermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical
representations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach
to safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as
AES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches
impossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible
solution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial
performance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity
searches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using
Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary
contributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to
music information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and
propose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music
embeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we
demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through
empirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to improve device localization via channel charting in urban environments, achieving significant error reduction and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance localization accuracy and robustness in challenging NLoS urban environments by leveraging EMSs to improve channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting.

Method: Develops an optimization framework for EMS phase profile design, targeting key metrics like localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity, validated via 3D ray-traced simulations.

Result: Optimized EMS configurations reduce the 90th-percentile localization error from >60m to <25m, while improving trustworthiness and continuity.

Conclusion: This is the first work to use static EMSs for channel charting, demonstrating substantial localization performance improvements in NLoS conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to
enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban
environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS
to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS
phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles
of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity.
Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we
demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant
improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile
localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically
improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for
enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under
challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum sensing and secure IRS-assisted opportunistic access under CSI uncertainty, with robust detection and efficient downlink design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of Byzantine attacks and CSI uncertainty in spectrum sensing and IRS-assisted communication, ensuring secure and adaptive opportunistic access.

Method: Uses logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation for sensing, and sum MSE minimization for downlink design. Alternating algorithms and Bayesian optimization are employed for optimization.

Result: Higher detection probability under attacks, reduced sum MSE for honest users, suppressed eavesdropper power, and fast convergence.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, adaptive solution for secure opportunistic communication by integrating sensing and transmission through joint learning.

Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum
sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic
access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage
performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and
attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs
with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded
number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink
design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and
signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase
shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an
augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide
provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local
curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)
in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)
surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound
(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of
the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show
higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial
attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of
eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a
practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI
availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through
joint learning.

TL;DR: GBS introduces an end-to-end generative model and reward preference alignment system to improve bid shading in RTB, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bid shading methods suffer from unimodal assumptions, cascading errors, and sample selection bias, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: GBS uses an autoregressive generative model for shading ratios and a CHNet-based reward model for fine-grained feature extraction and surplus optimization.

Result: GBS outperforms existing methods in offline and online tests and is deployed on Meituan DSP, handling billions of bids daily.

Conclusion: GBS effectively addresses bid shading challenges, offering a robust solution for RTB with demonstrated real-world scalability.

Abstract: Bid shading plays a crucial role in Real-Time Bidding~(RTB) by adaptively
adjusting the bid to avoid advertisers overspending. Existing mainstream
two-stage methods, which first model bid landscapes and then optimize surplus
using operations research techniques, are constrained by unimodal assumptions
that fail to adapt for non-convex surplus curves and are vulnerable to
cascading errors in sequential workflows. Additionally, existing discretization
models of continuous values ignore the dependence between discrete intervals,
reducing the model's error correction ability, while sample selection bias in
bidding scenarios presents further challenges for prediction. To address these
issues, this paper introduces Generative Bid Shading~(GBS), which comprises two
primary components: (1) an end-to-end generative model that utilizes an
autoregressive approach to generate shading ratios by stepwise residuals,
capturing complex value dependencies without relying on predefined priors; and
(2) a reward preference alignment system, which incorporates a channel-aware
hierarchical dynamic network~(CHNet) as the reward model to extract
fine-grained features, along with modules for surplus optimization and
exploration utility reward alignment, ultimately optimizing both short-term and
long-term surplus using group relative policy optimization~(GRPO). Extensive
experiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness.
Moreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions
of bid requests daily.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A decentralized approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for UAV trajectory and user assignment in MEC, outperforming centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of non-convex optimization, user mobility, and communication overhead in centralized UAV-MEC systems.

Method: Proposes a fully decentralized setup with local DRL (EPS-PPO) and graph attention layers (GAT) for UAV coordination.

Result: Outperforms existing methods like MADDPG in performance metrics, using only local communications.

Conclusion: Decentralized DRL with local neighbor communication is effective for UAV-MEC, offering scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently utilized in multi-access
edge computing (MEC) as edge servers. It is desirable to design UAVs'
trajectories and user to UAV assignments to ensure satisfactory service to the
users and energy efficient operation simultaneously. The posed optimization
problem is challenging to solve because: (i) The formulated problem is
non-convex, (ii) Due to the mobility of ground users, their future positions
and channel gains are not known in advance, (iii) Local UAVs' observations
should be communicated to a central entity that solves the optimization
problem. The (semi-) centralized processing leads to communication overhead,
communication/processing bottlenecks, lack of flexibility and scalability, and
loss of robustness to system failures. To simultaneously address all these
limitations, we advocate a fully decentralized setup with no centralized
entity. Each UAV obtains its local observation and then communicates with its
immediate neighbors only. After sharing information with neighbors, each UAV
determines its next position via a locally run deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm. None of the UAVs need to know the global communication graph.
Two main components of our proposed solution are (i) Graph attention layers
(GAT), and (ii) Experience and parameter sharing proximal policy optimization
(EPS-PPO). Our proposed approach eliminates all the limitations of
semi-centralized MADRL methods such as MAPPO and MA deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG), while guaranteeing a better performance than independent
local DRLs such as in IPPO. Numerical results reveal notable performance gains
in several different criteria compared to the existing MADDPG algorithm,
demonstrating the potential for offering a better performance, while utilizing
local communications only.

TL;DR: An AI-driven system automates the drafting of Statements of Work (SOW), making it faster, more accurate, and legally compliant compared to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual drafting of SOWs is slow, complex, and error-prone, requiring a solution to streamline the process.

Method: The system uses three AI agents: one drafts the SOW, another checks legal compliance, and the third handles formatting and final checks.

Result: The system drafts a full SOW in under three minutes with high accuracy, reducing legal risks and saving time.

Conclusion: AI can support legal and business professionals by automating routine tasks, improving efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) is a vital part of business and legal
projects. It outlines key details like deliverables, timelines,
responsibilities, and legal terms. However, creating these documents is often a
slow and complex process. It usually involves multiple people, takes several
days, and leaves room for errors or outdated content. This paper introduces a
new AI-driven automation system that makes the entire SOW drafting process
faster, easier, and more accurate. Instead of relying completely on humans, the
system uses three intelligent components or 'agents' that each handle a part of
the job. One agent writes the first draft, another checks if everything is
legally correct, and the third agent formats the document and ensures
everything is in order. Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates,
this system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW
to match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and
formatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real
business examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes,
compared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well
in accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot
of time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support
legal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping
them focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal
processes smarter, faster, and more reliable.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of data preprocessing in AI/ML for climate prediction, offering protocols to improve forecast quality and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of data preprocessing on climate predictions and ensure robust AI/ML applications.

Method: Establishes protocols for preprocessing, including anomaly standardization, handling non-stationarity, and extreme values, supported by case studies.

Result: Different preprocessing techniques yield varying predictions, highlighting the need for standardized practices.

Conclusion: Adopting recommended preprocessing practices enhances the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) -- and specifically machine learning (ML) --
applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating
quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data
preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional
statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill
and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly
influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model
development, thus yielding the colloquialism "garbage in, garbage out." As
such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input
data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to
decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers,
developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate
predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such
applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are
using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in
this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with
non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data,
and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex
distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing
techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can
create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately,
implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance
the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.

### [691] [AuthPrint: Fingerprinting Generative Models Against Malicious Model Providers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05691)
*Kai Yao,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for verifying the origin of generative model outputs using fingerprinting, even when the model provider acts adversarially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of mechanisms for verifying the origin of generative model outputs in high-stakes domains.

Method: Extends fingerprinting techniques with a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict and verify them.

Result: Achieves near-zero FPR@95%TPR for GAN and diffusion models, even with small modifications, and remains robust against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively verify provenance attribution in adversarial settings, with practical applicability demonstrated.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet
current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs.
We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the
traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act
adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate
fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The
methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the
model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict
and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve
near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when
tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data.
Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively
modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at

*Ivan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time, self-tuning (RTST) moderator framework for defending LLMs against adversarial attacks, ensuring adaptability and minimal impact on benign prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptable and lightweight defenses against adversarial attacks on LLMs without degrading performance on benign inputs.

Method: Proposes an RTST moderator framework, evaluated empirically using Google's Gemini models against modern jailbreaks.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness and advantages over traditional fine-tuning or classifier models.

Conclusion: The RTST framework offers a scalable, adaptive solution for LLM alignment and security.

Abstract: Ensuring LLM alignment is critical to information security as AI models
become increasingly widespread and integrated in society. Unfortunately, many
defenses against adversarial attacks and jailbreaking on LLMs cannot adapt
quickly to new attacks, degrade model responses to benign prompts, or introduce
significant barriers to scalable implementation. To mitigate these challenges,
we introduce a real-time, self-tuning (RTST) moderator framework to defend
against adversarial attacks while maintaining a lightweight training footprint.
We empirically evaluate its effectiveness using Google's Gemini models against
modern, effective jailbreaks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of an
adaptive, minimally intrusive framework for jailbreak defense over traditional
fine-tuning or classifier models.

### [693] [Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06734)
*Ngoc N. Tran,Anwar Said,Waseem Abbas,Tyler Derr,Xenofon D. Koutsoukos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Graph-based malware classifiers achieve high accuracy but struggle with unseen variants. A semantic enrichment framework improves robustness by adding contextual features, tested on new benchmarks showing up to 8% better performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based malware classifiers lack generalization to unseen variants from the same family, indicating a need for deeper semantic understanding.

Method: Proposes a semantic enrichment framework for function call graphs, incorporating contextual features like metadata and code embeddings, adaptable to inconsistent feature availability.

Result: Improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and enhances robustness when combined with adaptation methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for resilient malware detection in evolving threat environments.

Abstract: Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard
Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when
evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a
scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This
highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model
architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture
deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment
framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features,
including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived
from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under
real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports
flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under
realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks:
MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family
partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat
behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that
our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution
shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with
adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building
resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.

### [694] [Fading the Digital Ink: A Universal Black-Box Attack Framework for 3DGS Watermarking Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07263)
*Qingyuan Zeng,Shu Jiang,Jiajing Lin,Zhenzhong Wang,Kay Chen Tan,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMEA, a black-box attack framework targeting 3DGS watermarking systems, balancing watermark removal and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS watermarking techniques by testing their robustness against attacks.

Method: Formulates the attack as a multi-objective optimization problem, using a group-based strategy to partition the 3DGS model and an indirect objective function to blind the watermark detector.

Result: GMEA successfully removes 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS methods while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: The study highlights weaknesses in current 3DGS copyright protection and urges the development of more robust systems.

Abstract: With the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a variety of digital
watermarking techniques, embedding either 1D bitstreams or 2D images, are used
for copyright protection. However, the robustness of these watermarking
techniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper
introduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based
Multi-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these
watermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective
optimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a
black-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the
watermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted
by a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative. To
manage the vast search space of 3DGS models, we employ a group-based
optimization strategy to partition the model into multiple, independent
sub-optimization problems. Experiments demonstrate that our framework
effectively removes both 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS watermarking
methods while maintaining high visual fidelity. This work reveals critical
vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS copyright protection schemes and calls for the
development of more robust watermarking systems.

### [695] [EFU: Enforcing Federated Unlearning via Functional Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07873)
*Samaneh Mohammadi,Vasileios Tsouvalas,Iraklis Symeonidis,Ali Balador,Tanir Ozcelebi,Francesco Flammini,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EFU is a federated unlearning framework that ensures client privacy by hiding unlearning intent from the server using functional encryption and auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FU methods compromise client autonomy and privacy by revealing unlearning intent to the server. EFU addresses this by enforcing privacy through cryptographic techniques.

Method: EFU uses functional encryption to bind encrypted updates to specific aggregation functions, preventing server detection. It also employs adversarial examples and parameter regularization to mask unlearning effects.

Result: EFU achieves near-random accuracy on forgotten data while maintaining model performance, all while hiding unlearning intent from the server.

Conclusion: EFU provides a secure, verifiable, and server-agnostic solution for federated unlearning, enhancing client privacy and autonomy.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) algorithms allow clients in federated settings to
exercise their ''right to be forgotten'' by removing the influence of their
data from a collaboratively trained model. Existing FU methods maintain data
privacy by performing unlearning locally on the client-side and sending
targeted updates to the server without exposing forgotten data; yet they often
rely on server-side cooperation, revealing the client's intent and identity
without enforcement guarantees - compromising autonomy and unlearning privacy.
In this work, we propose EFU (Enforced Federated Unlearning), a
cryptographically enforced FU framework that enables clients to initiate
unlearning while concealing its occurrence from the server. Specifically, EFU
leverages functional encryption to bind encrypted updates to specific
aggregation functions, ensuring the server can neither perform unauthorized
computations nor detect or skip unlearning requests. To further mask behavioral
and parameter shifts in the aggregated model, we incorporate auxiliary
unlearning losses based on adversarial examples and parameter importance
regularization. Extensive experiments show that EFU achieves near-random
accuracy on forgotten data while maintaining performance comparable to full
retraining across datasets and neural architectures - all while concealing
unlearning intent from the server. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EFU is
agnostic to the underlying unlearning algorithm, enabling secure,
function-hiding, and verifiable unlearning for any client-side FU mechanism
that issues targeted updates.

### [696] [Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745)
*Jiongchi Yu,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Yuhan Ma,Ziming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Chimera is an LLM-based multi-agent framework simulating insider activities to generate diverse, realistic logs for ITD research, addressing data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insider threat detection lacks high-quality data due to sensitive enterprise data and limited/synthetic public datasets.

Method: Chimera uses LLM-based agents to simulate benign/malicious activities, including 15 attack types, across three domains, producing ChimeraLog.

Result: ChimeraLog is diverse, realistic, and challenging (F1-score 0.83 vs. CERT's 0.99), validated by human studies and quantitative analysis.

Conclusion: ChimeraLog advances ITD research by providing a scalable, realistic dataset, improving detection methods.

Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security
concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods
have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of
high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while
publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient
real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich
semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the
first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically
simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse
logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with
agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group
meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic
organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP
theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three
sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical
institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via
human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and
presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods
show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the
CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for
advancing ITD research.

### [697] [IPBA: Imperceptible Perturbation Backdoor Attack in Federated Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08031)
*Jiayao Wang,Yang Song,Zhendong Zhao,Jiale Zhang,Qilin Wu,Junwu Zhu,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes IPBA, an imperceptible backdoor attack method for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL), addressing challenges like limited transferability and feature entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in FSSL rely on obvious triggers, lacking stealth and practicality. IPBA aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: IPBA decouples feature distributions of backdoor and augmented samples, using Sliced-Wasserstein distance to optimize trigger generation.

Result: IPBA outperforms existing methods in performance and robustness under various defenses.

Conclusion: IPBA is a highly effective and stealthy backdoor attack method for FSSL, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of
decentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a
cutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy
preservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research
indicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods
generally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet
the requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this
paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against
FSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible
triggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited
transferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and
out-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the
effectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To
overcome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor
and augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate
the out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the
trigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios
and datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack
methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense
mechanisms.

### [698] [Robust Anomaly Detection in O-RAN: Leveraging LLMs against Data Manipulation Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08029)
*Thusitha Dayaratne,Ngoc Duy Pham,Viet Vo,Shangqi Lai,Sharif Abuadbba,Hajime Suzuki,Xingliang Yuan,Carsten Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection in O-RAN architectures to counter data manipulation attacks like hypoglyphs, showing robustness and low latency but needing accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased complexity and openness of 5G and O-RAN architectures introduce security vulnerabilities, such as data manipulation attacks via malicious xApps, which traditional ML methods fail to handle.

Method: The study investigates LLMs for anomaly detection in O-RAN, testing their ability to process manipulated data (hypoglyphs) without crashing and measuring detection latency.

Result: LLM-based xApps show robustness against hypoglyph attacks and achieve low detection latency (<0.07s), though initial detection accuracy needs improvement.

Conclusion: LLMs are promising for secure anomaly detection in O-RAN due to their robustness and low latency, but further research is needed to enhance accuracy through prompt engineering.

Abstract: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture
has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the
increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel
security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised
Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In
particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing
subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used
by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These
Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures
in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders,
which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN
architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps
maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing
manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy
requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to
adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use
their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy,
although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs
achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for
Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

*Adedire D. Adesiji,Jiashuo Wang,Cheng-Shu Kuo,Keith A. Brown*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper reviews how self-driving labs (SDLs) accelerate materials discovery by reducing the number of experiments needed, using metrics like acceleration factor (AF) and enhancement factor (EF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and understand how SDLs improve the speed and quality of materials discovery compared to traditional methods.

Method: The review summarizes theoretical metrics (AF and EF), analyzes literature data, and conducts simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns.

Result: Median AF is 6, increasing with dimensionality, while EF peaks at 10-20 experiments per dimension. Simulations show EF depends on parameter space properties, and AF on its complexity.

Conclusion: SDLs provide significant value across material parameter spaces, and the metrics (AF, EF) offer a common language for quantifying their acceleration.

Abstract: A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials
discovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine
learning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this
promise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably,
and with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes
progress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by
quantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given
goal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics,
namely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how
much faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next,
we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range
of AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality
of the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In
contrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although
they consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these
results, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that
reveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space
while AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the
motivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of
material parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and
understanding this acceleration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming flat training landscapes and lengthy training processes in parameterised quantum circuits for data encoding.

Result: Competitive accuracy on simulators and real hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in sampling efficiency and runtime (up to 2x speedup).

Conclusion: The proposed QAS framework effectively enhances quantum feature map design, offering practical advantages for quantum machine learning.

Abstract: The quest for effective quantum feature maps for data encoding presents
significant challenges, particularly due to the flat training landscapes and
lengthy training processes associated with parameterised quantum circuits. To
address these issues, we propose an evolutionary training-free quantum
architecture search (QAS) framework that employs circuit-based heuristics
focused on trainability, hardware robustness, generalisation ability,
expressivity, complexity, and kernel-target alignment. By ranking circuit
architectures with various proxies, we reduce evaluation costs and incorporate
hardware-aware circuits to enhance robustness against noise. We evaluate our
approach on classification tasks (using quantum support vector machine) across
diverse datasets using both artificial and quantum-generated datasets. Our
approach demonstrates competitive accuracy on both simulators and real quantum
hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in terms of sampling
efficiency and achieving up to a 2x speedup in architecture search runtime.

TL;DR: A novel continual learning framework addresses catastrophic forgetting in non-stationary data streams by incorporating random effects and infinite parameter dimensions, supported by a computationally efficient Multi-step Newton Iteration algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling non-stationary data streams in online continual learning with constrained storage, which causes catastrophic forgetting during sequential task training.

Method: Proposes a continual learning framework with random effects and infinite parameter dimensions, using a Multi-step Newton Iteration algorithm for efficient computation.

Result: Theoretical derivation of asymptotic normality for the estimator, validated by synthetic and real datasets, shows the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and is computationally efficient, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: We focus on the critical challenge of handling non-stationary data streams in
online continual learning environments, where constrained storage capacity
prevents complete retention of historical data, leading to catastrophic
forgetting during sequential task training. To more effectively analyze and
address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, we
propose a novel continual learning framework from a statistical perspective.
Our approach incorporates random effects across all model parameters and allows
the dimension of parameters to diverge to infinity, offering a general
formulation for continual learning problems. To efficiently process streaming
data, we develop a Multi-step Newton Iteration algorithm that significantly
reduces computational costs in certain scenarios by alleviating the burden of
matrix inversion. Theoretically, we derive the asymptotic normality of the
estimator, enabling subsequent statistical inference. Comprehensive validation
through synthetic data experiments and two real datasets analyses demonstrates
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce\nthese demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the\nessential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's\npredictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation\napproaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level\noptimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and\noriginal nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this\nsense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn\nlinear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent\nand less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph\ncondensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a\nnovel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition\n(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an\ninformative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.\nExtensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD\neffectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up\nto a 4.0\\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive\nperformance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

This\nshift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of\nproactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual\nframework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI\ninteraction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator.

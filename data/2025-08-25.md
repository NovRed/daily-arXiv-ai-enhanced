### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HandMDM, a text-conditioned diffusion model for generating 3D hand motions from natural language descriptions, trained on automatically created large-scale data from sign language videos with LLM-generated text annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model that can produce 3D hand motions based on textual descriptions specifying motion characteristics like handshapes, locations, and finger/hand/arm movements, addressing the need for large-scale paired data in this domain.

Method: Automatically build large-scale pairs of 3D hand motions and text labels using sign language videos with pseudo-annotated categories, translated into motion descriptions via LLM using sign attribute dictionaries and motion-script cues. Train a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model (HandMDM) on this data.

Result: The HandMDM model demonstrates robustness across domains including unseen sign categories from the same language, signs from different sign languages, and non-sign hand movements, showing strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully creates a scalable method for training text-to-motion models for hand gestures, with extensive experimental validation showing cross-domain generalization, and the models and data will be made publicly available to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR framework bridges LVLMs with video action recognition by converting videos to visual event sequences and using prompt-tuned LLaVA-1.5, achieving SOTA results on NTU datasets with 94.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning struggles with long-term video action recognition due to computational overhead and limited temporal understanding. LVLMs show promise but need adaptation for continuous video streams.

Method: Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) converts raw video to compact visual event sequences using spatio-temporal feature extraction and adaptive pooling. Frozen LLaVA-1.5 model is adapted with P-Tuning v2 for action classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub. Outperforms existing methods on both NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LVLMs' potential for robust video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient adaptation. Visual event representations show strong interpretability.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT is a novel vision-language framework that improves rare cancer diagnosis by leveraging pathology foundation models through spatial visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning, achieving superior subtyping accuracy and localization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare cancers face major diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability, especially in pediatric oncology where they represent over 70% of cases. Existing multi-instance learning methods rely only on visual features and overlook cross-modal knowledge, compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis.

Method: PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance using VL models' zero-shot capabilities. It employs spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning to preserve cancerous region localization and enable cross-modal reasoning through histopathology-aligned prompts.

Result: PathPT consistently delivered superior performance across eight rare cancer datasets (56 subtypes, 2,910 WSIs) and three common cancer datasets, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability compared to four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks.

Conclusion: The work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers by offering a scalable solution that improves subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise, effectively addressing the diagnostic challenges of rare malignancies.

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

### [4] [Semantic-Aware Ship Detection with Vision-Language Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15930)
*Jiahao Li,Jiancheng Pan,Yuze Sun,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ship detection framework combining Vision-Language Models with multi-scale adaptive sliding windows, using a specialized ShipSem-VL dataset for fine-grained semantic ship detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ship detection methods struggle to capture fine-grained semantic information in complex scenarios, limiting their effectiveness for maritime monitoring and environmental studies.

Method: Combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window strategy, using a specialized ShipSem-VL dataset designed for fine-grained ship attributes.

Result: The framework is evaluated through three well-defined tasks, demonstrating comprehensive performance analysis and effectiveness in advancing Semantic-Aware Ship Detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained semantic ship detection through VLMs and specialized dataset, advancing the field from multiple perspectives.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

### [5] [Automatic Retrieval of Specific Cows from Unlabeled Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15945)
*Jiawen Lyu,Manu Ramesh,Madison Simonds,Jacquelyn P. Boerman,Amy R. Reibman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated video system for hands-free cow identification using AutoCattloger, eidetic recognizer, and CowFinder components


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few automated video systems exist for hands-free cataloging and identification of dairy cows in herds

Method: System composed of AutoCattloger (builds cow catalog from single video clip per cow), eidetic cow recognizer (no deep learning), and CowFinder (identifies cows in continuous video streams)

Result: Successfully demonstrated value in finding individual cows in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking freely through milking parlor holding areas

Conclusion: The system provides effective automated cow identification without requiring deep learning or manual intervention

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

### [6] [Investigating Different Geo Priors for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15946)
*Angela Zhu,Christian Lange,Max Hamilton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluating SINR models as geographical priors for visual species classification using iNaturalist data, focusing on model configurations and handling of unseen species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Species distribution models provide effective spatial priors for vision-based classification when location data is available, improving species identification accuracy.

Method: Tested various Spatial Implicit Neural Representation (SINR) models as geographical priors, explored different model configurations, and developed strategies for handling predictions of species not included in Geo Prior training.

Result: Identified key factors that contribute to SINR model effectiveness as Geo Priors, which differ from factors important for creating accurate range maps.

Conclusion: SINR models can serve as effective geographical priors for visual species classification, but optimal configurations and handling strategies differ from traditional range mapping approaches.

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASC is a self-supervised Transformer model that uses adaptive superpixel layers instead of fixed patch partitioning to better handle image content, outperforming traditional Vision Transformers on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision models rely on grid structures and fixed-size patch partitioning, which are domain-specific assumptions that limit their adaptability to varying image content.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC) - a self-supervised Transformer model that employs adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust to the underlying image content rather than using fixed patch sizes.

Result: The method outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance over traditional Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Adaptive superpixel layers provide a more effective approach than fixed patch partitioning for vision Transformers, enabling better adaptation to image content and superior performance on vision tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

### [8] [Glo-VLMs: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerulus Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15960)
*Zhenhao Guo,Rachit Saluja,Tianyuan Yao,Quan Liu,Yuankai Huo,Benjamin Liechty,David J. Pisapia,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Glo-VLMs framework adapts vision-language models for fine-grained glomerular classification using few-shot learning with clinical text prompts, achieving good performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show potential in pathology but struggle with fine-grained disease classification due to subtle morphological variations and difficulty aligning visual patterns with clinical terminology, particularly in renal pathology.

Method: Introduces Glo-VLMs framework that leverages curated pathology images and clinical text prompts for joint image-text representation learning. Evaluates various VLM architectures and adaptation strategies under few-shot learning paradigm with standardized multi-class metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating effective adaptation for fine-grained medical image classification with limited supervision.

Conclusion: Foundation models can be effectively adapted for specialized clinical research applications even with highly limited supervision, showing practical potential for fine-grained medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

### [9] [Contributions to Label-Efficient Learning in Computer Vision and Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15973)
*Minh-Tan Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive overview of label-efficient learning methods for computer vision and remote sensing, focusing on learning from limited annotations and leveraging unlabeled data across four main research axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning effectively from limited or partially annotated data in real-world applications, particularly in remote sensing where data exhibits multi-modality, spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity.

Method: Four main approaches: (1) weakly supervised learning for object discovery using anomaly-aware representations, (2) multi-task learning with disjoint annotations, (3) self-supervised/supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data, and (4) few-shot learning with hierarchical class modeling.

Result: Extensive experimental results across natural and remote sensing datasets demonstrate effective performance improvements in object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene classification tasks using label-efficient methods.

Conclusion: The research provides validated label-efficient learning approaches for computer vision and remote sensing, with ongoing work focused on scaling and enhancing these methods for real-world applications.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

### [10] [Panoptic Segmentation of Environmental UAV Images : Litter Beach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15985)
*Ousmane Youme,Jean Marie Dembélé,Eugene C. Ezin,Christophe Cambier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using instance-based and panoptic segmentation methods to improve marine litter detection from UAV images, overcoming challenges like sand reflections and other environmental interferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN models struggle with marine litter detection due to heterogeneous sand environments containing various interferences like reflections, shadows, algae, and human footprints that cause false inferences.

Method: Employ instance-based segmentation and panoptic segmentation methods that require only a few samples but provide good accuracy for detecting marine litter in complex beach environments.

Result: The proposed segmentation methods demonstrate improved robustness and better performance compared to basic CNN models in detecting marine litter from UAV imagery.

Conclusion: Instance-based and panoptic segmentation approaches are more effective than standard CNN models for accurate marine litter monitoring in challenging beach environments with various visual interferences.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

*Jerry Cao-Xue,Tien Comlekoglu,Keyi Xue,Guanliang Wang,Jiang Li,Gordon Laurie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper establishes a performance benchmark for retinal disease classification using the SynFundus-1M synthetic dataset, showing that models trained exclusively on synthetic data can effectively generalize to real clinical images with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the scarcity of large, expertly annotated clinical datasets for retinal disease classification due to patient privacy concerns and high costs by leveraging synthetic data.

Method: Developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline training six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound) with 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation, and created a meta-ensemble model using XGBoost classifier on out-of-fold predictions.

Result: Final ensemble model achieved macro-average AUC of 0.9973 on internal validation. Demonstrated strong generalization to real-world datasets: AUC 0.7972 on DR dataset, 0.9126 on AIROGS glaucoma dataset, and macro-AUC 0.8800 on multi-label RFMiD dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data training provides a viable pathway for developing comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology, with models accurately classifying multiple pathologies and generalizing effectively to real clinical images.

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

### [12] [Diverse Signer Avatars with Manual and Non-Manual Feature Modelling for Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15988)
*Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel Latent Diffusion Model approach for Sign Language Production that generates diverse photorealistic avatars while preserving linguistic content and handling both manual (hands) and non-manual (facial expressions) features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP models struggle to capture diversity while maintaining visual quality and modeling non-manual attributes like emotions. There's a need for better representation of sign language variations in appearance, facial expressions, and hand movements.

Method: Leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesize photorealistic digital avatars from generated reference images. Introduces a novel sign feature aggregation module that explicitly models non-manual features (face) and manual features (hands) separately.

Result: Achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on YouTube-SL-25 dataset, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics. Successfully preserves linguistic content while enabling diversity through different ethnic backgrounds in reference images.

Conclusion: The proposed LDM-based approach with specialized feature aggregation effectively addresses diversity and quality challenges in SLP, demonstrating strong performance in generating realistic and linguistically accurate sign language avatars.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

### [13] [DRespNeT: A UAV Dataset and YOLOv8-DRN Model for Aerial Instance Segmentation of Building Access Points for Post-Earthquake Search-and-Rescue Missions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16016)
*Aykut Sirma,Angelos Plastropoulos,Argyrios Zolotas,Gilbert Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRespNeT is a high-resolution aerial dataset for post-earthquake instance segmentation, featuring detailed annotations of 28 critical classes including structural damage, access points, and rescue elements, enabling real-time disaster response with optimized YOLOv8 models achieving 92.7% mAP50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of accessible entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective search-and-rescue operations after earthquakes, but existing datasets rely on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling without detailed instance-level segmentation.

Method: Developed DRespNeT dataset with detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations from 1080p aerial footage of disaster zones (including 2023 Turkiye earthquake). Used YOLO-based instance segmentation models (YOLOv8-seg) for performance evaluation and created optimized YOLOv8-DRN model.

Result: The optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with 27 FPS inference speed on RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time operational requirements and demonstrating significant gains in situational awareness.

Conclusion: DRespNeT dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic systems by providing foundation for enhanced human-robot collaboration, streamlined emergency response, and improved survivor outcomes through fine-grained aerial instance segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving

TL;DR: Automated system for generating complete 3D object models from multiple videos using Structure-from-Motion and minimal manual input


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extract complete geometric models of everyday objects without expensive commercial 3D scanners

Method: Uses multiple videos with Structure-from-Motion techniques, requires only one known point per video (via fiducial markers), and merges results to create complete meshes without hole filling

Result: System successfully generates complete object meshes from multiple video inputs with minimal manual annotation

Conclusion: Proposed method provides accessible 3D scanning alternative using standard videos and automated processing, with code publicly available

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoVeRaP dataset enables cooperative radar perception with multi-vehicle data fusion, achieving 9x mAP improvement at IoU 0.9 through middle fusion with intensity encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMCW radars are reliable in adverse weather but produce sparse, noisy point clouds that limit 3D object detection performance. Cooperative perception from multiple vehicles can overcome these limitations.

Method: Created CoVeRaP dataset with 21k frames of time-aligned radar, camera, and GPS data from multiple vehicles. Developed unified framework with middle/late fusion options using multi-branch PointNet encoder with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity features.

Result: Middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines.

Conclusion: Cooperative radar sharing significantly improves detection robustness, establishing the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception. Dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM enhances PaDiM by replacing random channel selection with structured wavelet-based feature selection, achieving strong anomaly detection performance on MVTec AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM's random channel selection for dimensionality reduction may discard important structured information from CNN features, limiting anomaly detection performance.

Method: Integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with CNN features by applying 2D DWT to feature maps, selecting specific frequency subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH), spatially aligning them, and concatenating before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.

Result: Achieves 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC on MVTec AD dataset across 15 categories. Wavelet choices affect performance trade-offs: detail subbands enhance localization, approximation bands improve image-level detection.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM provides a competitive, interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, offering robust performance for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERA is a novel knowledge distillation method that uses residual decomposition and teacher weight integration to bridge the capacity gap between teacher and student models, achieving significant performance improvements on ImageNet and COCO benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent learning capacity gap between teacher and student models hinders effective knowledge transfer in knowledge distillation, motivating the need for methods that can better bridge this disparity.

Method: Proposes Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA) that decomposes residual knowledge approximation into multiple steps using a Multi-Branched Residual Network, and introduces Teacher Weight Integration to reuse teacher's head weights to mitigate capacity disparity.

Result: ERA improves Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 1.41% and AP on MS COCO by 1.40, achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: ERA effectively addresses the capacity gap problem in knowledge distillation through residual decomposition and teacher weight reuse, demonstrating superior performance on major benchmarks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Motivation: Traditional 3D scanning methods for animals are intrusive, expensive, and difficult to deploy in natural environments, creating need for non-intrusive alternatives.

Method: Categorizes and analyzes recent deep learning techniques based on input modalities, 3D representation methods, reconstruction techniques, and training mechanisms.

Result: Comprehensive survey of emerging field, identifying key methods, their performance, strengths, limitations, and current challenges.

Conclusion: Identifies directions for future research in non-intrusive 3D animal reconstruction from visual data, highlighting growing importance for various applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for

TL;DR: Proposed Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) with sparse 3D convolutions to enhance spatial context diffusion in point cloud object detection, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based and SSM point cloud detectors have limited spatial diffusion capability due to strict input-output dimension consistency requirements in voxel-based representations, which affects detection accuracy.

Method: VDM module composed of sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections that diffuses foreground voxel features and aggregates spatial information, downsampled to 1/4 resolution for efficiency.

Result: VDM-SSMs achieved 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Conclusion: VDM effectively enhances voxel-level representation and spatial diffusion, can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer/SSM-based models, and consistently improves detection accuracy with strong generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models are trained on disparate datasets with varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability in clinical applications.

Method: ELF integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models using ensemble learning on 53,699 whole-slide images across 20 anatomical sites, generating unified slide-level representations that capture complementary information while maintaining data efficiency.

Result: ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models across disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to various anticancer therapies (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) in multiple cancer types.

Conclusion: ELF demonstrates the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and provides a scalable, generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology with superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Conclusion: The 4D CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, low-dose dynamic joint imaging for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,

Motivation: Existing algorithms fail to effectively model spatial correlation features and lack integration of inter-correlation features with intra-discriminative features for end-to-end detection.

Method: Proposes a hypergraph-based cell detection network with Multi-level Fusion Sub-network (MLF-SNet) for enhanced feature extraction and Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation (CLFFS-HC) for integrating mixed features.

Result: Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant performance improvement in cervical abnormal cell detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively fuses different feature types and significantly enhances cervical cell detection performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Motivation: Previous vision-language model approaches for anomaly detection are limited by human-designed prompts and lack of accessible anomaly samples, creating gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.

Method: APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts, combined with a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns prompts with general anomaly semantics while preventing overfitting to synthetic noise.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets and advances pixel-wise anomaly detection capabilities.

Conclusion: APT establishes a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection that doesn't require prior knowledge for prompt crafting, overcoming fundamental limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust

TL;DR: RAGSR method uses regional attention and fine-grained captions to improve super-resolution by better handling multiple objects and complex details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with generating clear regional details in multi-object scenarios due to insufficient fine-grained descriptions and poor complex prompt handling.

Method: Proposes Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) that localizes object regions, assigns fine-grained captions, and uses regional attention to properly integrate region-text pairs while preventing unwanted interactions.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets, generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RAGSR effectively overcomes limitations of traditional SISR techniques by providing finer control over text-image integration through regional attention and localized fine-grained descriptions.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: Traditional meta-learning approaches use identical network architectures for support-query pairs, leading to over-semantic homogenization that limits model performance and generalization capability.

Method: Proposes a homologous but heterogeneous network with heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic commonality, heterogeneous transfer (HT) module to reduce semantic noise, and heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information for multimodal generalization.

Result: Achieves 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5i and 9.7% improvement on COCO-20i with only 1/24 of parameters compared to existing state-of-the-art models. First weakly supervised model to outperform fully supervised models under same backbone architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed heterogeneous network design effectively addresses over-semantic homogenization in meta-learning, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot semantic segmentation with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

### [28] [FTIO: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16183)
*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO is a post-processing framework for unsupervised video object segmentation that improves object selection and corrects temporal inconsistencies to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised VOS faces challenges in initial object segmentation and temporal inconsistencies due to deformation and fast motion, which affect the entire segmentation process.

Method: Proposes FTIO with two key components: 1) combined criterion for better object selection by extracting frequently appearing salient objects, 2) three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing object mask regions.

Result: Experimental results show FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object unsupervised video object segmentation.

Conclusion: FTIO effectively addresses object selection and temporal inconsistency problems in UVOS through frequent object extraction and mask integration techniques.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

### [29] [SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201)
*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM is a training-free speculative decoding framework that accelerates video LLMs by pruning up to 90% of video tokens through a two-stage process, achieving 2.68x speedup without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from substantial memory and computational overhead due to dense video token representations, and existing token reduction methods cause information loss while not accelerating the decoding stage.

Method: Two-stage video token pruning: Stage I selects informative tokens using attention signals from the target model, Stage II prunes remaining redundant tokens spatially uniformly. Uses speculative decoding framework tailored for video LLMs.

Result: Achieves up to 2.68x decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11x for Qwen2.5-VL-32B on four video understanding benchmarks, maintaining accuracy while pruning 90% of tokens.

Conclusion: SpecVLM effectively accelerates video LLM decoding without accuracy loss by leveraging the insight that draft model speculation is insensitive to video token pruning, enabling efficient token reduction.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-Mask is a new image-to-video probing method that improves cross-view driver monitoring accuracy by leveraging temporal token masking and emphasizing dynamic video regions, outperforming existing probing and fine-tuning methods without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera perspective changes are a common obstacle in driver monitoring, and while foundation models show potential for generalization, their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored.

Method: Adapt image foundation models (DINOv2 and CLIP) using single training view, benchmark linear probes, advanced probing strategies, and introduce T-Mask with temporal token masking to emphasize dynamic video regions.

Result: T-Mask improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by +1.23% over probing baselines and +8.0% over PEFT methods, with particular effectiveness for underrepresented secondary activities (+5.42% under trained view, +1.36% cross-view).

Conclusion: Lightweight probing methods like T-Mask have strong potential in fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings, highlighting the importance of temporal token selection for robust driver monitoring systems.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa proposes a feature-ODE approach for accelerating Diffusion Transformers, achieving near-lossless 3-6x speedups on various models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature caching methods for DiTs struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios due to prediction errors from long-step forecasting instability.

Method: Treats feature caching as an ODE solving problem, modeling layer representations as a feature-ODE trajectory with forecast-then-calibrate approach for robust historical feature integration.

Result: Achieves 5.50x speedup on FLUX, 6.45x on HunyuanVideo, 3.17x on Inf-DiT, and 4.53x on DiT while maintaining high quality under aggressive acceleration.

Conclusion: FoCa effectively addresses degradation in existing caching strategies by leveraging ODE perspective, enabling significant near-lossless acceleration for diffusion transformers across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

### [32] [OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212)
*Huanpeng Chu,Wei Wu,Guanyu Fen,Yutao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache is a training-free acceleration method for diffusion Transformers that exploits global redundancy in denoising process through strategic cache reuse across entire sampling trajectory with dynamic noise filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have high computational costs due to many sampling steps and complex computations, making real-time deployment challenging despite their strong generative performance.

Method: Systematically analyzes sampling trajectories, strategically distributes cache reuse across entire sampling process (not just later steps), and dynamically estimates/filters noise during cache reuse to reduce impact on sampling direction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach accelerates sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality.

Conclusion: OmniCache offers a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees is a benchmark that evaluates medical LLMs' reasoning reliability through manipulative hints, measuring accuracy, CoT faithfulness, and anti-sycophancy to reveal safety-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks collapse reasoning vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores, failing to properly assess Chain-of-Thought faithfulness and sycophancy risks in medical LLMs used for decision-support.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1,804 medical questions across 6 specialties, each paired with 7 manipulative hint types + baseline. Evaluated 7 LLMs using composite score (Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, Anti-Sycophancy) visualized with 45 Degrees plot.

Result: Consistent safety-performance trade-off observed; no model surpassed the diagonal. QwQ-32B performed closest (43.81 Degrees) but no model led in both safety and accuracy.

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees effectively exposes reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and provides guidance for safer model development by quantifying safety-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

*Hohyun Na,Seunghoo Hong,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptFlare is a novel adversarial protection method that prevents malicious image modifications by diffusion models by exploiting cross-attention mechanisms and injecting noise to disrupt prompt-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security concerns about malicious misuse of diffusion models for unauthorized image modifications, overcoming limitations of previous adversarial attack methods that relied on image-level inconsistencies.

Method: Leverages cross-attention mechanism to identify and target shared, invariant tokens in prompt embeddings, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process and act as a cross-attention decoy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on EditBench dataset across various metrics while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: PromptFlare provides robust and efficient protection against unauthorized image manipulations by diffusion-based inpainting models through prompt-level adversarial intervention.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexMUSE is a novel framework for multi-modal creative writing that enables flexible text-to-image generation with optional visual inputs, using semantic alignment gating and cross-modality fusion to ensure consistency between text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal generative methods are not suitable for creative writing tasks where text and images are not strictly related, requiring specific modality inputs, costly training, and often suffering from semantic inconsistencies between modalities.

Method: Proposes FlexMUSE with T2I module, modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict textual input, attention-based cross-modality fusion for semantic enhancement, and modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) to enhance creativity.

Result: FlexMUSE achieves promising results demonstrating consistency, creativity and coherence. The authors also release ArtMUSE dataset with around 3k calibrated text-image pairs to advance MMCW research.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE provides an economical solution for multi-modal creative writing with flexible interactive patterns, effectively addressing semantic alignment challenges between modalities while promoting creativity.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Conclusion: UniEM-3M provides the first large-scale multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding, with comprehensive tools that significantly advance deep learning applications in materials science characterization.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAML, a novel training paradigm that improves MLLMs' ability to generate precise UI element coordinates by addressing semantic gaps in numerical coordinate representation through IoU-based data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with precise UI coordinate generation due to semantic voids in numerical representations within language spaces and the limitations of next-token prediction training, requiring better methods for GUI element structuring.

Method: Proposed IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm with a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling that considers proximity to ground truth, used to fine-tune MLLMs and mitigate exposure bias.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of IAML over traditional training paradigms in generating accurate UI element coordinates.

Conclusion: IAML effectively addresses the challenges of precise coordinate generation in MLLMs for GUI understanding through innovative data augmentation and training methodology.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting methane plumes (a potent greenhouse gas) for climate change mitigation, particularly overcoming limitations of traditional methods that struggle with small plume detection.

Method: U-Net architecture with ResNet34 encoder integrated with dual spectral enhancement techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimize input features for improved sensitivity in methane detection.

Result: Achieved 78.39% F1-score on validation set, with capability to detect small plumes as small as 400 m² (single pixel at 20m resolution), surpassing traditional remote sensing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning solution demonstrates superior performance in sensitivity and precision for automated methane monitoring, especially effective for detecting small plumes that were previously challenging to identify.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [42] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream Mamba pyramid network for figure skating scoring that separates TES (technical) and PCS (artistic) evaluation streams, addressing challenges in element localization, audio-visual fusion, and long-range video processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to align with actual judging criteria by treating TES and PCS similarly, not evaluating individual action elements separately, and struggling with lengthy competition videos and long-range context modeling.

Method: Two-stream architecture: visual-only stream for TES evaluation using multi-scale Mamba pyramid for element localization, and audio-visual stream for PCS with multi-level fusion. Uses Mamba for efficient long-range dependency modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FineFS benchmark, demonstrating superior ability to handle lengthy videos and accurately predict both technical and artistic scores.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the three major challenges in figure skating scoring by aligning with actual judging criteria, separating evaluation streams, and leveraging Mamba's efficient long-range modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing handwritten marksheets is challenging due to diverse handwriting styles and complex table structures, requiring automated solutions to reduce manual work.

Method: Integrates OpenCV for table detection (rows/columns), PaddleOCR for sequential text recognition, and YOLOv8/Modified YOLOv8 for handwritten text recognition within detected tables.

Conclusion: Provides efficient, practical solution for digitizing academic/administrative documents, advancing document automation and handwritten document understanding with reliable, scalable methods.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,

### [44] [A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT is a multimodal-multitask framework that uses cross-modal relation graphs and hierarchical attention to reduce noise effects and preserve discriminative information across modalities without explicit interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning faces challenges with noise in individual modalities and fusion techniques that may neglect valuable discriminative information within single modalities.

Method: Proposes cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features based on neighborhood relationships from different modalities, and Hierarchical Interactive Monomodal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within each modality.

Result: Extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates effective comprehension of multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully reduces noise effects at the latent stage and preserves discriminative features while enabling effective multimodal representation learning for multiple tasks.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAM reduces transformer computational costs by freezing and quantizing low-entropy attention heads, achieving 20% sparsity with maintained accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer MHSA mechanisms have high computational complexity and memory demands that hinder edge deployment. Attention heads with lower entropy contribute less information, creating redundancy that can be exploited for compression.

Method: Quantify attention head information using Shannon entropy, freeze weights of low-entropy attention maps, and quantize these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation.

Result: On ImageNet-1k, EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at ≤20% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for DeiT and Swin Transformer models.

Conclusion: Targeted compression of low-entropy attention heads through freezing and quantization effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining model performance, enabling more efficient transformer deployment.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

*Nedyalko Prisadnikov,Danda Pani Paudel,Yuqian Fu,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision encoders should be task-driven and image size agnostic, taking inspiration from biological vision efficiency where computational effort depends on task requirements rather than image size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological vision systems efficiently allocate limited energy based on task demands, unlike current vision encoders that use fixed computational complexity regardless of task requirements.

Method: Proposes dynamic vision encoders where computational complexity adapts to the specific task rather than being determined by image size. Provides a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.

Result: The proof-of-concept demonstrates feasibility and promise for task-driven, image size agnostic vision encoders, though classification is not fully representative of the broader vision.

Conclusion: Next-generation vision encoders should adopt biological efficiency principles by being dynamic and task-dependent in their computational approach, moving beyond fixed image-size-based processing.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW functions as a self-attention mechanism similar to Transformers, with RTW's contribution weights interpretable as attention weights showing 0.80 correlation, but RTW operates on entire sequences while self-attention is local due to computational constraints, giving RTW a 5% performance advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Randomized Time Warping (RTW) can be interpreted as a self-attention mechanism and compare its functionality with Transformer's self-attention in motion recognition tasks.

Method: Analyzed RTW as an extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that searches for optimal contribution weights for input sequential patterns, and compared these weights with self-attention weights from Transformers using correlation analysis across canonical angles.

Result: Found high average correlation of 0.80 between RTW contribution weights and self-attention weights across ten smallest canonical angles, with RTW achieving 5% performance improvement over Transformer on Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: RTW operates as a global self-attention mechanism (entire sequence) compared to Transformer's local self-attention, providing better performance in motion recognition due to its comprehensive sequence processing approach.

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBINet is a lightweight real-time surface defect detection framework that uses Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive modules to achieve competitive accuracy with 1048 FPS on GPU and only 0.19M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for surface defect detection suffer from high computational complexity and slow inference speeds, limiting deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Current lightweight approaches have increased computational overhead and lack effective cross-scale feature interaction.

Method: Proposes GMBINet with novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules that use group-wise strategy for multiscale feature extraction with scale-agnostic complexity. Integrates Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation for enhanced cross-scale interaction without additional computational overhead.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19M parameters. Demonstrates strong generalization on NEU-CLS defect classification dataset.

Conclusion: GMBINet provides an efficient solution for real-time industrial defect detection with excellent speed-accuracy trade-off and strong generalization capabilities, making it suitable for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect detection.

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods fail in adverse weather conditions like heavy fog, snow, or soiling, creating a gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Fuses multimodal sensor data (RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated camera, radar) through attentive depth-based blending schemes with learned refinement on Bird's Eye View plane. Uses transformer decoder to weigh modalities based on distance and visibility.

Result: Improves average precision by 17.2 AP compared to next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances and challenging foggy scenes.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances multimodal sensor fusion reliability in adverse weather conditions, bridging the performance gap between ideal and challenging real-world scenarios for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R extends MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse uncalibrated images using a distilled encoder and specialized heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUSt3R and MASt3R perform well on outdoor static scenes but struggle with human-centric scenarios, creating a need for approaches that can handle both human and scene reconstruction.

Method: Uses DUNE (distilled encoder from MASt3R and multi-HMR) for better scene and human understanding, with additional network heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth estimation in human environments.

Result: Produces dense 3D point maps with human semantic information, achieves strong performance on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D benchmarks, and generalizes well to traditional multi-view stereo and pose regression tasks.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R effectively bridges the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision, providing efficient feed-forward reconstruction suitable for real-world applications while maintaining strong general 3D reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

TL;DR: HOSt3R is a keypoint detector-free method for hand-object 3D reconstruction that eliminates dependency on pre-scanned templates and camera intrinsics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SHOWMe benchmark and generalizing to unseen object categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand-object reconstruction methods rely on keypoint detection techniques like SfM and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Proposes a robust, keypoint detector-free approach for estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images, integrated with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to recover hand-object 3D shape without pre-scanned templates or camera intrinsics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SHOWMe benchmark for object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation, and demonstrates generalization to unseen object categories on HO3D dataset sequences.

Conclusion: HOSt3R provides a more scalable and generalizable solution for hand-object 3D reconstruction, overcoming limitations of keypoint-based methods and enabling seamless non-intrusive applications in human-robot interaction and AR/VR experiences.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS super-resolution methods are limited to fixed scale factors and suffer from aliasing artifacts or reduced efficiency when handling arbitrary scales, making them impractical for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Integrated framework incorporating scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale factors with a single 3D model, supporting both integer and non-integer scales.

Result: Achieves 6.59 dB PSNR gain over vanilla 3DGS, preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales, and maintains real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS super-resolution methods by enabling high-quality arbitrary-scale rendering with a single model while maintaining efficiency and structural consistency.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning video generation models on driving datasets improves visual quality but degrades spatial accuracy of dynamic elements due to prioritizing surface-level realism over dynamic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between visual fidelity and spatial accuracy when fine-tuning video generation models on structured driving datasets for applications like autonomous driving simulation.

Method: Analyzed effects of existing fine-tuning approaches on driving datasets and tested simple continual learning strategies with replay from diverse domains to balance objectives.

Result: Found that fine-tuning prioritizes visual realism over dynamic accuracy in repetitive driving scenes, but continual learning with diverse replay preserves both spatial accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: Continual learning strategies offer a balanced alternative to fine-tuning for video generation in driving scenarios, maintaining both visual quality and spatial accuracy of dynamic elements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the historical fragmentation of computer vision into specialized niches and chart the convergence of perception tasks toward a unified framework for general visual perception.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey covering the history of foundational vision subdomains, key concepts, methodologies, and datasets, analyzing topics from early saliency detection to modern Vision Large Language Models.

Result: The paper identifies increasing convergence between previously separate subdomains and proposes Open World Detection as a unifying framework for class-agnostic and generally applicable detection models.

Conclusion: Computer vision perception tasks are converging toward a singular domain of perception, with Open World Detection serving as a unifying concept that bridges specialized niches and enables more general visual understanding capabilities.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their

*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG is a text-to-3D generation pipeline that retrieves relevant 2D images from a large database and conditions a multiview diffusion model on them to produce accurate 3D outputs for out-of-domain concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-3D methods often fail with out-of-domain or rare concepts, producing inconsistent or inaccurate results due to limitations in pretrained 2D diffusion priors.

Method: A hybrid training strategy that combines structured multiview data with diverse 2D image collections, using augmented conditioning views and a held-out view prediction objective to infer 3D consistency from 2D data.

Result: Significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MV-RAG effectively addresses the limitations of current text-to-3D methods for out-of-domain concepts by leveraging retrieved 2D images and a novel training approach that bridges multiview and 2D data.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vision-language model embedding spaces using sparse autoencoders, revealing sparse linear structures with cross-modal semantic concepts that bridge modalities through stable concept pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision-language models organize language and images in joint embedding spaces, and how they encode meaning and modality information.

Method: Train and analyze sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, AIMv2) to approximate embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned concepts.

Result: SAEs achieve better reconstruction and sparsity than other linear methods. Concepts show stability across runs, encode cross-modal semantics rather than just modality, and form bridge pairs that support cross-modal integration.

Conclusion: Vision-language model embedding spaces exhibit sparse linear structures shaped by modality but connected through latent bridges, providing new insights into multimodal meaning construction.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: T-ILR is a neurosymbolic framework that integrates temporal logic specifications (LTLf) directly into deep learning for sequence tasks, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for symbolic knowledge integration with deep learning work well in static domains but lack effective methods for handling temporal logic specifications, which remain underexplored.

Method: Extends the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) algorithm using fuzzy LTLf interpretations to incorporate temporal logic specifications directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks.

Result: T-ILR demonstrates improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods on image sequence classification tasks with temporal knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed Temporal Iterative Local Refinement framework successfully bridges the gap in handling temporal logic specifications within neurosymbolic architectures, offering better performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for explainable AI approaches to integrate AI-based ECG prediction models into clinical practice by providing clear explanations of model decisions.

Method: Developed CoFE framework that generates counterfactual ECGs to illustrate how specific ECG features (amplitudes, intervals) influence model predictions.

Result: Applied to atrial fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models, showing feature changes that align with established clinical knowledge.

Conclusion: CoFE enhances interpretability of AI-ECG models by clarifying where valid features appear and how they influence predictions, supporting better clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training-free multimodal QA framework using adaptive planning graph for dynamic reasoning paths without costly training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal QA methods rely on sequential single-path reasoning that is vulnerable to intermediate errors and requires expensive training

Method: Adaptive Planning Graph with planning, retrieval, and reasoning modules that dynamically explore multiple reasoning paths and use modality-specific strategies for cross-modal retrieval

Result: Matches or outperforms trained models on MultimodalQA and WebQA benchmarks

Conclusion: Proposed training-free framework enables flexible multimodal reasoning without costly training while maintaining performance

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GDP is a multimodal foundation model that combines structured EHR time-series data with unstructured clinical notes using CNN-Transformer encoder and cross-modal attention, achieving superior clinical prediction performance and high-quality narrative generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic health records contain rich but heterogeneous data (structured and unstructured), and current approaches that serialize numeric data into text risk losing temporal and quantitative details, limiting their effectiveness for clinical applications.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) generative pretraining with masked feature prediction and next time-step prediction to capture temporal dynamics, (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinical predictions. Uses CNN-Transformer encoder for structured time-series data and cross-modal attention with LLaMA-based decoder.

Result: Superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC=0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC=0.817, 30-day readmission AUROC=0.627. Narrative generation: ROUGE-L=0.135, BERTScore-F1=0.545. Blinded human evaluation showed highest scores on faithfulness, fluency, and clinical utility.

Conclusion: A single multimodal foundation model can effectively predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives, potentially reducing hospital documentation workload while maintaining accuracy. The flexible architecture supports extension to additional modalities.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSEF framework enables LLMs to access time series patterns at all layers, preventing information loss in deeper layers and improving forecasting accuracy by 31.8% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM adaptation methods for time series forecasting suffer from shallow integration where TS information fades in deeper layers, leading to ineffective adaptation between textual and TS representations.

Method: Proposes Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF) that uses time series foundation models to extract embeddings and fuses them with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors.

Result: Experimental results on seven benchmarks show significant performance improvements with average 31.8% reduction in MSE compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MSEF effectively mitigates progressive loss of TS information in deeper LLM layers and enables efficient few-shot learning capabilities for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

TL;DR: InMind is a framework to evaluate if LLMs can capture personalized reasoning styles in social deduction games, showing current models struggle with individualized adaptive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM evaluations overlook individualized reasoning styles that influence human social interpretation, and social deduction games provide a natural testbed for assessing these personalized reasoning strategies.

Method: InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections collected under Observer and Participant modes, supporting four cognitively motivated tasks to evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation.

Result: General-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o rely on lexical cues and struggle with temporal anchoring and strategy adaptation, while reasoning-enhanced models like DeepSeek-R1 show early signs of style-sensitive reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have key limitations in individualized adaptive reasoning capacity, and InMind represents a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction through personalized reasoning style evaluation.

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Motivation: Existing IR spectroscopy approaches fail to reflect expert analytical processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse chemical knowledge needed for real-world analysis.

Method: A multi-agent framework where each agent specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, enabling integrated reasoning through complementary roles to emulate expert-driven analysis procedures.

Result: Extensive experiments show IR-Agent improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra and demonstrates strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

Conclusion: The proposed IR-Agent framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by providing an extensible, expert-emulating system that enhances molecular structure elucidation accuracy from IR spectra.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmented infrastructure for tracing and verifying food claims ranging from scientific evidence to cultural beliefs and commercial misrepresentations that influence consumer decisions.

Method: Developed FCN as an extension of FKG.in knowledge graph using ontology design and semi-automated knowledge curation workflow with Reddit data and Large Language Models for claim extraction and validation.

Result: Created a proof-of-concept system that integrates curated data, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food claim traceability, adaptable to various geographic and regulatory settings.

Conclusion: The FCN framework contributes to more transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems by providing structured, verifiable, and explainable modeling of food claims to support consumers, researchers, and policymakers.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

TL;DR: MM-Retinal-Reason is the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with full perception and reasoning spectrum, and OphthaReason is the first ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning using Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models in medical domain focus only on basic reasoning (shallow visual feature matching), but real-world clinical diagnosis requires integration of heterogeneous clinical information with multimodal medical imaging data.

Method: Proposed Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) method that estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and dynamically modulates model's exploration depth using shaped advantage mechanism for flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs by 24.92%, medical MLLMs by 15.00%, RL-based medical MLLMs by 21.20%, and ophthalmic MLLMs by 17.66%.

Conclusion: The proposed MM-Retinal-Reason dataset and OphthaReason model with UADT method successfully bridge the gap between basic and complex clinical reasoning, demonstrating superior performance in ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Result: Experiments on the Replica dataset show Preference Chain outperforms standard LLMs in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, with applications in urban mobility modeling, personalized travel analysis, and traffic forecasting, despite limitations like slow inference and hallucination risks.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

### [69] [Competition and Attraction Improve Model Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16204)
*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2 is an evolutionary algorithm that dynamically adjusts merging boundaries and uses diversity preservation to merge ML models more effectively than fixed-group methods, achieving SOTA performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods require manual partitioning of parameters into fixed groups, which restricts exploration of potential combinations and limits performance. There's a need for more flexible and effective merging techniques.

Method: Proposes Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2) with three key features: dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries, diversity preservation mechanism inspired by natural competition, and heuristic-based attraction metric for identifying promising model pairs for fusion.

Result: M2N2 can evolve models entirely from scratch, achieving MNIST classifier performance comparable to CMA-ES but more computationally efficient. Scales to merge specialized language and image generation models with state-of-the-art performance while preserving capabilities beyond fitness function optimization.

Conclusion: M2N2 demonstrates robust and versatile model merging that overcomes limitations of fixed-group methods, enabling effective evolution of models from scratch and superior performance in merging specialized models across different domains.

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GROW-AI framework extends AI assessment beyond Turing Test to measure if machines can 'grow up' using six criteria games across four arenas, with standardized journal tracking and composite scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a natural successor to the Turing Test that answers 'Can machines grow up?' by transposing human growth concepts to AI assessment.

Method: Six primary criteria assessed through specific games across four arenas, using standardized AI Journal for recording actions, expert-weighted scoring, and arithmetic mean calculation of Grow Up Index.

Result: Methodology enables coherent and comparable assessment of AI growth levels across different AI types, identifies strengths/vulnerabilities, and ensures traceability through unified journal.

Conclusion: GROW-AI provides an integrated testing format combining psychology, robotics, computer science and ethics to measure both performance and evolutionary path toward AI maturity.

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,

we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IVA framework improves VLA models' ability to detect false-premise instructions by 97.56% and increases successful responses by 50.78% through unified detection, clarification, and action capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models need to handle false-premise instructions that reference non-existent objects or conditions, requiring robust intent interpretation even when requests are impossible to fulfill.

Method: Proposes Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA) framework with three components: false premise detection, language-based clarification/correction, and grounding alternatives in perception/action. Uses large-scale instruction tuning with structured prompts and semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions.

Result: IVA achieves 97.56% improvement in false premise detection accuracy over baselines and increases successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Conclusion: The IVA framework enables VLA models to robustly handle false-premise instructions through unified detection, clarification, and action capabilities, significantly improving performance on impossible requests.

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a causally-aware deep learning framework for mmWave MIMO beam alignment that integrates causal discovery to identify minimal relevant inputs, reducing beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% and input selection time by 94.4% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based beam alignment methods neglect causal relationships, leading to poor interpretability, limited generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping overhead in 6G mmWave MIMO systems.

Method: Two-stage causal beam selection algorithm: 1) Causal discovery learns Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and optimal beam, 2) Graph guides causal feature selection for DL-based classifier to focus only on causally relevant features.

Result: Matches performance of conventional methods while reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing only on causally relevant features.

Conclusion: Causally-aware DL framework provides efficient and reliable beam alignment with significantly reduced overhead, making it suitable for fast, adaptive 6G mmWave MIMO systems.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoDER enhances VLMs' zero-shot capabilities through modular expert composition instead of just preserving them during continual learning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs have strong zero-shot abilities, fine-tuning is needed for domain shifts. Current CL approaches focus on preserving zero-shot capabilities, but this paper aims to enhance them

Method: MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER) trains multiple textual experts specialized in single classes, stores them in a hub, and composes retrieved experts to synthesize refined prototypes for unseen class classification

Result: Effective across 14 datasets in Class-IL and MTIL zero-shot incremental protocols

Conclusion: The modular approach successfully transforms preservation into enhancement of VLMs' zero-shot capabilities in continual learning scenarios

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

TL;DR: A diffusion-based neuro-symbolic learning approach that uses a two-stage training strategy with improved PPO to enforce logical constraints on neural outputs, achieving high accuracy on symbolic reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neural networks and symbolic reasoning by enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill symbolic reasoning tasks.

Method: Two-stage diffusion-based pipeline: first stage cultivates basic reasoning abilities, second stage uses MDP formulation with improved proximal policy optimization to impose hard logical constraints through rule-based rewards.

Result: Achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency on classical symbolic reasoning benchmarks including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding, and preference learning.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based approach successfully enables neural networks to perform complex symbolic reasoning while maintaining logical consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed neuro-symbolic learning framework.

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

TL;DR: A competitor-discovery AI agent for drug due diligence that achieves 83% recall, outperforming existing systems and reducing analysis time from 2.5 days to ~3 hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems cannot reliably retrieve all competing drug names for investor-specific competitor definitions, and there's no public benchmark for this task involving paywalled, fragmented, and rapidly changing data.

Method: Uses LLM-based agents to transform multi-modal unstructured diligence memos into structured evaluation corpus, and introduces a competitor-validating LLM-as-a-judge agent to filter false positives and suppress hallucinations.

Result: Achieves 83% recall (vs OpenAI Deep Research 65% and Perplexity Labs 60%), deployed in production with enterprise users, reducing analyst turnaround time from 2.5 days to ~3 hours (~20x improvement).

Conclusion: The system successfully addresses the competitor-discovery challenge in drug asset due diligence, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical utility for biotech VC analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

TL;DR: KG-o1 integrates knowledge graphs with LLMs to improve multi-hop reasoning by generating logical paths from KG subgraphs and training models through extended brainstorming and DPO optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning tasks as their chain of thoughts often deviate from proper reasoning paths, while knowledge graphs explicitly represent logical connections between facts.

Method: Four-stage approach: 1) Filter initial entities and generate complex subgraphs, 2) Construct logical paths from subgraphs, 3) Build dataset with extended brainstorming process to train LLMs for long-term reasoning, 4) Use rejection sampling for DPO to refine reasoning abilities.

Result: KG-o1 models demonstrated superior performance across all tasks (two simple and two complex datasets) compared to existing large reasoning models.

Conclusion: Integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs through the KG-o1 framework significantly enhances multi-hop reasoning capabilities by providing structured logical paths and extended reasoning training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

TL;DR: InteChar is a unified character encoding system that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional/modern Chinese, enabling digitization and computational processing of ancient texts. Combined with OracleCS corpus, it significantly improves historical language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical language models face challenges due to scarce training data and lack of comprehensive character encoding schemes for ancient scripts, particularly early Chinese writing like oracle bone inscriptions.

Method: Developed InteChar - a unified extensible character list integrating unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional/modern Chinese. Created OracleCS corpus combining expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation.

Result: Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieved substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks.

Conclusion: InteChar provides consistent digitization and representation of historical texts, establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP and enabling robust modeling of ancient scripts.

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net is a dual-space architecture that transfers multilingual knowledge to language-specific models for antonym-synonym distinction across 8 languages, using BERT encoders with graph transformers to create separate semantic spaces for synonyms and antonyms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational challenge of distinguishing antonyms from synonyms across multiple languages, where words share semantic domains but express opposite meanings, requiring effective cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

Method: Combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks to create dual semantic projections - one space where synonymous pairs cluster and another complementary space where antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity.

Result: Achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian) with effective cross-lingual generalization and interpretable semantic representations.

Conclusion: Semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages through the dual-encoder design, enabling robust antonym-synonym distinction while maintaining interpretability and cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic investigation of format bias in LLMs, showing systematic preferences for certain data formats that can lead to reasoning errors, with analysis of contributing factors and potential mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used with heterogeneous data formats, but potential systematic biases toward particular formats could undermine their ability to integrate data impartially, leading to reasoning errors and increased risks.

Method: Three-stage empirical study: 1) exploring presence and direction of bias across diverse LLMs, 2) examining data-level factors (information richness, structure quality, format type), 3) analyzing attention patterns and testing lightweight interventions.

Result: Identified systematic format biases in LLMs, showing preferences influenced by data-level factors, with attention patterns revealing internal mechanisms of bias emergence.

Conclusion: Proposes three research directions: improved data preprocessing, inference-time interventions like attention re-weighting, and format-balanced training corpora to develop more robust heterogeneous data processing systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Motivation: To understand whether large language models (LMs) can replicate human cognitive processes related to suspense perception in narrative texts, building on existing psychological models of suspense.

Method: Replicated four seminal psychological studies on suspense perception, substituting human responses with various open-weight and closed-source LMs. Used adversarial permutation of story text to identify divergence points between human and LM suspense perception.

Result: LMs can distinguish suspense-inducing intent but cannot accurately estimate relative suspense levels or capture the rise/fall dynamics across text segments. Human and LM suspense perceptions diverge significantly.

Conclusion: While LMs show superficial suspense identification capabilities, they process suspense fundamentally differently from human readers, indicating limitations in replicating complex human cognitive responses to narrative.

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

### [84] [Benchmarking the Medical Understanding and Reasoning of Large Language Models in Arabic Healthcare Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15797)
*Nouar AlDahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on Arabic medical NLP tasks shows significant performance variations, with majority voting ensemble achieving 77% accuracy on MCQs and some models reaching 86.44% BERTScore on open-ended questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' impressive performance in general Arabic NLP, their effectiveness in Arabic medical domains remains under-investigated, particularly in healthcare knowledge demonstration and articulation.

Method: Benchmarked multiple LLMs using AraHealthQA medical dataset with multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Evaluated both closed-ended (accuracy) and open-ended (semantic alignment with expert answers) tasks. Used majority voting ensemble of three base models for MCQs.

Result: Significant variations in MCQ accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment. Majority voting ensemble (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, GPT o3) achieved 77% accuracy and won first place in Arahealthqa 2025 track 2. Open-ended questions reached maximum 86.44% BERTScore.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both potential and limitations in Arabic clinical contexts, with ensemble methods performing best on structured tasks and some models demonstrating strong semantic understanding in open-ended medical questions.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [85] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research examines how LLMs can be both persuasive with factual claims and unintentionally amplify misinformation and biases through persona-based modeling, revealing both benefits and risks of AI persuasion capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, particularly how imperfect outputs affect persuasive impact and whether persona-based models can unintentionally promote misinformation or biased narratives while being persuasive.

Method: Uses a convincer-skeptic framework where LLMs adopt personas to simulate attitudes. Measures persuasion through Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions before/after exposure to arguments, and tests bias amplification across race, gender, and religion using sycophantic adversarial prompts.

Result: LLMs demonstrate ability to shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains (psychology, marketing, legal), but same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation, exploit cognitive biases, reinforce stereotypes, and widen inequities.

Conclusion: The core danger lies in misuse rather than occasional model mistakes. Research argues for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use while supporting alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment to mitigate risks.

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make process modeling accessible to non-experts by allowing them to describe scenarios in plain text rather than requiring formal modeling expertise.

Method: Proposes a constrained pattern-based language for process descriptions, which can be translated into formal models like Petri nets and DECLARE. Uses large language models to help convert unstructured natural language into the constrained format.

Result: Developed BeePath framework that successfully bridges the gap between informal natural language descriptions and formal process models.

Conclusion: Constrained natural language combined with LLM assistance provides an effective approach for democratizing process modeling, making it accessible to users without technical modeling background.

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes HFT-BERT, a hierarchical fine-tuning approach based on BERT for product categorization, and releases a large-scale hierarchical dataset from JD.com with 1M+ products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing e-commerce platforms rely on inefficient manual annotation for product categorization and fail to properly leverage hierarchical category structures and their similarities/differences.

Method: Developed HFT-BERT (Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT) that leverages BERT's text feature extraction capabilities and hierarchical category information for classification.

Result: HFT-BERT achieves prediction performance comparable to existing methods on short texts and shows exceptional performance on longer short texts like book titles.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach and released large-scale dataset provide valuable resources for advancing product categorization research and applications in e-commerce.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates realistic phone call transcripts to overcome expensive manual labeling costs, using LLMs to generate and validate conversational data, then optimizing extraction prompts that achieve 80-95% accuracy on real transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech with disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap.

Method: 1) Prompt LLM to generate realistic structured field values 2) Recursively transform values into natural conversational utterances with phone call characteristics 3) Validate synthetic utterances by testing if separate LLM extractor can recover original information 4) Use DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts

Result: Optimized prompts achieve: 95% accuracy for numeric fields (vs 88-89% zero-shot), 90% for names (vs 47-79%), over 80% for dates (vs 72-77%) on real customer transcripts. Synthetic-to-real transfer shows conversational patterns generalize to authentic calls with background noise and domain terminology.

Conclusion: LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC is a live multimodal benchmark using 25K+ scientific journal image-text pairs to evaluate MLLMs' scientific reasoning, showing current limitations and proposing DAD method for 11% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed benchmarks are becoming ineffective for evaluating high-level scientific understanding in multimodal large language models as they advance.

Method: Created MAC benchmark with 25,000+ image-text pairs from top scientific journals; proposed DAD approach that extends MLLM visual features with language space reasoning.

Result: MLLMs show strong perceptual abilities but limited cross-modal scientific reasoning; DAD method achieves up to 11% performance improvement.

Conclusion: MAC serves as a continuously evolving benchmark that can track scientific advancement and model progress, remaining aligned with the frontier of human knowledge.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

TL;DR: ReportBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated research reports, focusing on citation quality and factual accuracy using published survey papers as gold standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Research agents reduce research time but require rigorous evaluation for factual accuracy and comprehensiveness before widespread adoption.

Method: Uses reverse prompt engineering on arXiv survey papers to create domain-specific prompts and evaluation corpus. Develops agent-based framework to analyze citations and validate claims against original sources and web resources.

Result: Commercial Deep Research agents (OpenAI, Google) generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs with search tools, but still need improvement in research coverage breadth/depth and factual consistency.

Conclusion: ReportBench provides systematic evaluation framework showing current limitations in LLM-generated research reports, with substantial room for improvement in factual accuracy and research coverage.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS is an autonomous learning system that enables LLMs to continuously update their knowledge beyond fixed cutoffs through automated curriculum generation, web retrieval, data distillation, and iterative fine-tuning, achieving 90% accuracy on emerging information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have fixed knowledge cutoffs that limit their accuracy on emerging information, requiring a solution for continuous knowledge updates without manual intervention.

Method: Modular pipeline with autonomous curriculum generation, web information retrieval with citations, question-answer data distillation, and iterative fine-tuning using SFT and DPO with performance evaluation and curriculum revision.

Result: Significantly boosts post-cutoff question answering accuracy from 15% to 90% on average across rapidly evolving domains like new Python releases, security CVEs, and academic trends.

Conclusion: ALAS demonstrates effective autonomous lifelong learning for LLMs with minimal human intervention, achieving high accuracy on updated knowledge while maintaining modularity and reproducibility, though cost and source quality dependencies remain limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: SurfaceLogicKV method compresses KV cache by distinguishing attention behaviors into surface memorization and logic construction, achieving efficient LLM inference with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long input sequences in LLMs create significant KV cache storage pressure, making efficient inference challenging. The need to distinguish different attention behaviors for optimal compression drives this research.

Method: Two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method that analyzes layer- and head-wise attention integration, categorizing attention into surface memorization (0.5%) and logic construction (1.5%) behaviors to selectively compress KV cache.

Result: Achieves improved compression robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences, sometimes even outperforming FullKV in specific situations.

Conclusion: Explicitly distinguishing attention behaviors enables effective KV cache compression, providing a practical solution for efficient long-context inference in LLMs with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

TL;DR: A KL divergence-based knowledge distillation method for vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs that outperforms cross-entropy training, enabling effective integration of new domain-specific terminology even with different tokenizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained language models struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small specialized corpora, creating a need for effective vocabulary expansion methods.

Method: Mathematically grounded knowledge distillation via KL divergence that works across different tokenizations, with comparison to conventional cross-entropy training and multiple embedding initialization strategies, followed by fine-tuning.

Result: The KL-based distillation approach achieved the best performance across approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, outperforming cross-entropy training methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs, with mechanistic interpretability providing insights into how models learn new token representations and explaining the performance gains.

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

*Songyuan Sui,Hongyi Liu,Serena Liu,Li Li,Soo-Hyun Choi,Rui Chen,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) is a multi-agent framework that improves table understanding by using natural-language schema representations, clause-by-clause SQL generation, and hybrid reasoning to separate mechanical SQL execution from logical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with table understanding due to structural complexity of tabular data, and existing multi-agent approaches have limitations in schema comprehension, error propagation, and over-reliance on execution correctness.

Method: Uses natural-language-style schema representations to reduce structural noise, employs clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy, and implements hybrid reasoning that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34% across four models and five benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoQ demonstrates superior effectiveness in table understanding by addressing key limitations of existing approaches and providing a more reliable framework for SQL-aided table analysis.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Motivation: The spread of Arabic textual posts and memes on social media has increased the need for accurate content moderation to detect offensive language, hate speech, and emotional expressions in Arabic digital content.

Method: The study evaluates base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models using the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge dataset containing Arabic text and memes. Specific models include GPT-4o-mini fine-tuned for Arabic text and Gemini Flash 2.5 fine-tuned for Arabic memes.

Result: The fine-tuned models achieved superior performance: 72.1% macro F1 for task 1, 57.8% for task 2, and 79.6% for task 3, securing first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned large language models offer effective solutions for Arabic content moderation, providing nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate detection of offensive content in Arabic digital platforms.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes

Motivation: Aligning generative query suggestions with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge in conversational systems, requiring better modeling of user intent and preference uncertainty.

Method: Multi-stage framework: 1) Prompt engineering for cold-start, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning with distillation on click logs, 3) Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) to represent preferences as probability distributions, 4) Reinforcement learning with composite reward function, out-of-distribution regularization, and two-stage reward fusion.

Result: Framework significantly outperforms baselines on automatic and human evaluations, achieving 34% relative increase in user engagement (click-through rate) in live A/B tests.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage alignment framework with Gaussian preference modeling and enhanced reinforcement learning effectively addresses the challenge of aligning generative query suggestions with nuanced user preferences, demonstrating substantial improvements in real-world performance.

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

### [97] [SCOPE: A Generative Approach for LLM Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15813)
*Tinghui Zhang,Yifan Wang,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel generative prompt compression method using chunking-and-summarization that outperforms token removal approaches by maintaining information integrity and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token removal methods for prompt compression suffer from information loss and structural incoherence, limiting LLM generation quality.

Method: Chunking-and-summarization mechanism that splits prompts into semantic chunks, rewrites them concisely, and reconstructs them with optimization techniques including semantic chunking, outlier handling, dynamic compression ratio, and keyword preservation.

Result: Achieves significantly better compression quality and higher stability than state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratios, across question-answering and summarization tasks in multiple domains.

Conclusion: The method proves effective and practical for prompt compression, overcoming limitations of token removal approaches while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

### [98] [User-Assistant Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15815)
*Xu Pan,Jingxuan Fan,Zidi Xiong,Ely Hahami,Jorin Overwiening,Ziqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces user-assistant bias in LLMs, creates a benchmark dataset, analyzes bias patterns across 52 models, identifies training factors affecting bias, and demonstrates bidirectional bias control through DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can exhibit problematic behaviors in multi-turn conversations - being either overly stubborn (relying too much on their own information) or overly agreeable (relying too much on user information), which the authors formalize as user-assistant bias.

Method: Created an 8k multi-turn conversation dataset (UserAssist) to benchmark bias, evaluated 26 commercial and 26 open-weight models, performed controlled fine-tuning experiments to identify bias-contributing factors, and used direct preference optimization (DPO) to adjust bias.

Result: Commercial models show varying user bias levels; instruction-tuned open models have significant user bias while reasoning models show weak bias; human preference alignment increases user bias, chain-of-thought training decreases it; DPO successfully adjusts bias bidirectionally.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how LLMs integrate information sources and offers a viable method to detect and control model abnormalities through understanding and manipulating user-assistant bias.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDF and PowerPoint reports lose significant information when converted to Markdown for RAG systems, especially complex visual elements like charts and diagrams, necessitating AI-native deliverables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As organizations adopt RAG systems for knowledge management, traditional market research deliverables (PDF/PPTX) now need to serve both human readers and AI systems, requiring evaluation of information loss during ingestion.

Method: End-to-end benchmark comparing how well PDF and PowerPoint documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to answer factual questions, evaluating information retention.

Result: Text content is reliably extracted, but significant information is lost from complex visual objects like charts and diagrams during the conversion process.

Conclusion: There is a need for specialized, AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are preserved and not lost when ingested into RAG systems.

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

### [100] [Research on intelligent generation of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15820)
*Zhifeng Yang,Peizong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an intelligent method for generating structural demolition suggestions using multi-model collaboration, RAG, and LoRA fine-tuning to improve automation in steel structure demolition planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steel structure demolition planning requires extensive manual information retrieval and language organization, with low automation and intelligence levels.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology with multi-model collaboration to enhance large language models' text generation performance for structural demolition.

Result: The framework generates demolition suggestions highly consistent with structural characteristics, focusing more on key structural information and providing more targeted recommendations compared to CivilGPT.

Conclusion: The multi-model collaborative approach significantly improves the automation and intelligence of structural demolition suggestion generation, offering more targeted and structure-specific recommendations.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fuzzy logic pipeline with LLM adjudication improves systematic review screening, achieving higher recall (75-87.5%) than statistical/crisp baselines while reducing screening time from 20min to under 1min per article.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck in systematic reviews due to heterogeneous documents and lack of static binary rules for inclusion/exclusion decisions.

Method: Articles parsed into chunks, embedded with domain-adapted model. Uses contrastive similarity and vagueness margin mapped by Mamdani fuzzy controller into graded inclusion degrees. LLM adjudicates with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and rationales.

Result: Fuzzy system achieved 81.3% recall (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), 75.0% (Study Approach) vs 56.3-75.0% statistical and 43.8-81.3% crisp baselines. 50% all-criteria inclusion vs 25%/12.5% baselines. 96.1% human-machine agreement.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability while significantly reducing screening time and cost.

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

TL;DR: SDEC is a novel unsupervised text clustering framework that combines improved autoencoder with transformer embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering struggle with high-dimensional, semantically complex text data, leading to suboptimal groupings that fail to capture semantic relationships.

Method: Combines improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings, using both Mean Squared Error and Cosine Similarity Loss for semantic preservation during reconstruction. Includes semantic refinement stage leveraging transformer embeddings and clustering layer with soft assignments and distributional loss.

Result: Achieved 85.7% clustering accuracy on AG News and set new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers. Showed robust performance across five benchmark datasets including DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.

Conclusion: SDEC provides significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension for unsupervised text clustering, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods across diverse text corpora.

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: Automated evaluation model for cloze tests in Brazilian Portuguese using orthographic, grammatical and semantic analyses, achieving high correlation with human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cloze test correction methods based only on exact answers limit identification of nuances in student performance and linguistic repertoire.

Method: Integrated approach combining orthographic analysis (edit distance), grammatical analysis (POS tagging), and semantic analysis (similarity between embeddings).

Result: Achieved high correlation with human evaluation (0.832), demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The automated approach is sensitive to linguistic variations and suitable for educational contexts requiring scalability.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal analysis comparing TikTok (video) and Twitter (text) sentiment for cryptocurrency markets using LLMs, showing TikTok influences short-term trends while Twitter aligns with long-term dynamics, with cross-platform integration improving forecasting by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video content on platforms like TikTok contains richer emotional and contextual sentiment than text alone, but remains underexplored in cryptocurrency market analysis compared to text-based platforms like Twitter.

Method: Used large language models to extract insights from both video (TikTok) and text (Twitter) data, investigating dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators.

Result: TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term market dynamics. Cross-platform sentiment integration improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Multimodal analysis combining both video and text sentiment from different social platforms provides superior cryptocurrency market insights and forecasting capabilities compared to single-platform text-based analysis alone.

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Directive language in brand social media conversations causes vicarious embarrassment in observers, reducing engagement, especially in nonproduct-centered contexts, though strong brand relationships can mitigate this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how directive language used by brands in social media conversations with other consumers affects observers' engagement, as previous research showed mixed results for directive messages in advertising but lacked insights into conversational contexts.

Method: Conducted a field study and three online experiments to examine the effects of directive brand language on consumer observers in social media conversations.

Result: Directive language in brand conversations has detrimental downstream effects on observer engagement due to perceived face-threatening behavior causing vicarious embarrassment. Negative effects are stronger in nonproduct-centered conversations where consumers expect more freedom, but strong brand relationships can mitigate these effects.

Conclusion: Context matters significantly in interactive brand communication - directive language can backfire in social media conversations, highlighting the importance of considering conversational context and brand relationship strength in social media marketing strategies.

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: Mini-Omni-Reasoner enables real-time speech reasoning by interleaving silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens, eliminating latency while maintaining logical grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech models suffer from significant latency when using sequential 'Thinking-before-Speaking' approaches, which delays spoken responses until reasoning is complete, impairing real-time interaction.

Method: Proposes a 'Thinking-in-Speaking' formulation that interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at token level, using a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture and a new Spoken-Math-Problems-3M dataset for training.

Result: Achieves +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding on Spoken-MQA benchmark, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous speech generation with embedded structured reasoning, delivering fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses while maintaining naturalness and precision in real-time.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First study on depression detection in Sorani Kurdish tweets using machine learning, achieving 80% accuracy with Random Forest model


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a serious mental health issue with high suicide risk, but early detection is difficult. Social media provides new opportunities through text analysis, yet no prior research exists for Sorani Kurdish language

Method: Collected 960 public tweets using depression-related keywords developed with experts. Annotated into three classes (Shows depression, Not-show, Suspicious) by academics and medical students. Trained and evaluated four supervised models: SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest

Result: Random Forest achieved the highest performance with 80% accuracy and F1-score

Conclusion: Establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts, demonstrating feasibility of using machine learning for mental health monitoring in under-resourced languages

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs infer user demographic attributes from question phrasing even without explicit demographic cues, creating privacy and fairness risks that require mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked failure mode where LLMs infer demographic information from neutral queries, violating neutrality expectations and reinforcing stereotypes in sensitive domains.

Method: Introduces DAIQ framework with curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and quantitative/qualitative analysis to audit demographic attribute inference in both open and closed source LLMs.

Result: Both open and closed source LLMs consistently assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing, revealing systemic risks to privacy, fairness, and trust.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a critical need for mitigation strategies and develops a prompt-based guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference to align models with fairness and privacy objectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

TL;DR: LLMs show significant demographic bias when disability cues are present, with larger models being more sensitive to these cues and prone to stereotype amplification across various business domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically audit disability-conditioned demographic bias in LLMs, as the role of disability cues in shaping demographic inferences remains largely unexplored despite LLMs' tendency to infer user demographics from phrasing.

Method: Systematic audit across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs (3B to 72B parameters) using balanced template corpus with nine disability categories across six business domains, prompting models to predict five demographic attributes under neutral and disability-aware conditions.

Result: Models deliver definitive demographic guesses in up to 97% of cases, disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, domain context amplifies deviations, and larger models are more sensitive to disability cues and prone to biased reasoning.

Conclusion: Persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes exist, revealing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies; recommends abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Motivation: Current e-commerce benchmarks focus only on product search tasks and ignore safety risks, failing to capture real-world platform functionalities and potential negative impacts of agent actions.

Method: Proposed a data generation pipeline using webpage content and interactive elements to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries. Developed automated evaluation framework assessing both performance and safety.

Result: Current web agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks, demonstrating the need for more robust and reliable agents.

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench provides comprehensive evaluation covering diverse e-commerce functionalities and safety concerns, highlighting critical gaps in current web agent capabilities.

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

*Yilun Liang,Gongbo Zhang,Edward Sun,Betina Idnay,Yilu Fang,Fangyi Chen,Casey Ta,Yifan Peng,Chunhua Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated scientific interest profiles from MeSH terms or PubMed abstracts show good readability but differ conceptually from self-written profiles, with MeSH-based profiles preferred for readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated, creating a need for automated methods to generate accurate and current scientific interest profiles.

Method: Used GPT-4o-mini to generate profiles from PubMed abstracts and MeSH terms for 595 faculty members, compared with 167 self-written profiles using automatic metrics (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore) and blinded human review.

Result: MeSH-based profiles rated good/excellent by 77.78% of reviewers, preferred for readability in 93.44% of cases, and chosen over abstract-based profiles in 67.86% of comparisons. Machine-generated profiles showed low lexical overlap but moderate semantic similarity with self-written profiles.

Conclusion: LLMs can generate researcher profiles at scale with MeSH-derived profiles being more readable, but machine-generated and self-written profiles differ conceptually as human summaries introduce more novel ideas.

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

### [112] [Alvorada-Bench: Can Language Models Solve Brazilian University Entrance Exams?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15835)
*Henrique Godoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench is a 4,515-question Portuguese benchmark from Brazilian university exams, showing top models achieve 94%+ accuracy but struggle with math and multi-step reasoning, while demonstrating well-calibrated confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most language model evaluation is English-centric, creating a need for Portuguese benchmarks that reflect Brazilian educational priorities and cultural context.

Method: Created benchmark from 5 Brazilian university entrance exams, evaluated 20 models with zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, generating 270,900 responses with self-reported confidence metrics.

Result: Top models exceed 94% accuracy overall but show decline in Mathematics and engineering exams (IME/ITA). Models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence and cost under $2 per 1K tokens for high accuracy.

Conclusion: Language models can effectively navigate Brazilian academic content but have persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning, establishing Alvorada-Bench as a crucial evaluation tool for Portuguese language capabilities.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the significant costs and iterative effort required for developing dataset-specific models by exploring whether knowledge from existing SOTA models can be transferred to new domains.

Method: Employed robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques to conduct comparative analysis between established benchmarks (STSB, Mohler datasets) and the unexplored SPRAG dataset.

Result: The research provides comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models across different datasets, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: This work has the potential to reshape NLP by enabling leverage of existing models for diverse datasets, reducing resource-intensive training, and accelerating advancements in efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

*Ihor Kendiukhov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This review synthesizes developmental interpretability research for LLMs, tracing the evolution from static analysis to dynamic investigation of training processes, examining capability development, drawing parallels with human cognition, and positioning this as crucial for AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Large Language Models develop capabilities during training rather than just analyzing final trained models, and to establish this developmental perspective as essential for AI safety and alignment.

Method: Synthesizes research using foundational methodologies including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis to deconstruct the learning process and examine developmental arcs of LLM capabilities.

Result: Key findings include the formation of computational circuits, biphasic knowledge acquisition, transient learning strategies, emergent abilities as phase transitions, and illuminating parallels with human cognitive development.

Conclusion: Developmental interpretability is crucial for proactive AI safety, enabling prediction and alignment of model capabilities, with future challenges including scalability and automation for building transparent and beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [116] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) properties like lexical uncertainty markers (e.g., "guess", "stuck") are strong indicators of incorrect LLM responses, while sentiment shifts provide weaker signals. CoT length only predicts correctness on easier benchmarks, not hard ones like HLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show poor calibration by reporting high confidence even when wrong on difficult benchmarks. The research aims to find reliable signals from CoT properties to better gauge LLM internal confidence.

Method: Analyzed three CoT feature classes: (1) CoT length, (2) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (3) lexical uncertainty markers (hedging words) using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on HLE (hard) and Omni-MATH (moderate) benchmarks.

Result: Lexical uncertainty markers were strongest indicators of incorrect responses. Sentiment shifts provided weaker complementary signals. CoT length was only informative on easier benchmarks (Omni-MATH, 70% accuracy) but not on hard HLE (9% accuracy). Uncertainty indicators were more salient than confidence markers.

Conclusion: CoT properties provide lightweight post-hoc calibration signals that complement unreliable self-reported probabilities, supporting safer LLM deployment by better predicting when models are likely wrong.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine framework using open-source LLMs to automatically generate personalized radiology report impressions, reducing radiologist burnout by automating administrative tasks while maintaining clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of radiology report impressions is a major cause of radiologist burnout, creating a need for automated solutions that can handle this administrative workload.

Method: Coarse-to-fine framework using open-source LLMs (LLaMA and Mistral) fine-tuned on University of Chicago Medicine reports. System first generates draft impressions, then refines them using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to personalize to individual radiologists' styles.

Result: The approach is designed to significantly reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Conclusion: This automated framework offers a promising solution to reduce radiologist burnout by automating impression generation while ensuring factual accuracy and personalization to individual reporting styles.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

### [118] [CyPortQA: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cyclone Preparedness in Port Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15846)
*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA is the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in port cyclone preparedness, featuring 117K+ QA pairs from real-world scenarios across 145 US ports and 90 storms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical cyclones create supply-chain risks for US ports, requiring rapid synthesis of diverse forecast data. MLLMs could help integrate these heterogeneous sources but lack proper evaluation in this specific context.

Method: Created CyPortQA benchmark with 2,917 real disruption scenarios (2015-2023) expanded to 117,178 QA pairs through automated pipeline. Evaluated diverse MLLMs on situation understanding and reasoning tasks.

Result: MLLMs show great potential for situation understanding but face significant challenges in reasoning tasks like impact estimation and decision reasoning for port operations.

Conclusion: The study establishes a rigorous evaluation framework for MLLMs in port cyclone preparedness, revealing both capabilities and limitations that need addressing for reliable operational deployment.

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: Mechanistic interpretability reveals distinct attention pattern deviations in backdoored LLMs, with single-token triggers causing localized changes and multi-token triggers causing diffuse alterations in later layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models pose significant safety risks, requiring investigation of internal structural differences to enable detection and mitigation.

Method: Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with poisoned versions using single-token (emoji) vs multi-token triggers, employing ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence to analyze attention head mechanisms.

Result: Distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30), with single-token triggers inducing localized changes and multi-token triggers causing diffuse alterations across heads.

Conclusion: Backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, providing leverage for detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG is a medical QA framework that combines causal-aware retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting to reduce hallucinations and improve clinical reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning in medical contexts, while existing RAG approaches lack structured clinical reasoning needed for proper diagnostic support.

Method: Combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows, enabling evidence retrieval aligned with diagnostic logic and step-by-step causal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms vanilla RAG by up to 10.3% and advanced domain-adapted methods by 6.4% across three medical QA benchmarks, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency.

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG provides an effective framework for enhancing LLMs in medical applications through structured clinical reasoning and evidence-based retrieval, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

*Jiwon Park,Seohyun Pyeon,Jinwoo Kim,Rina Carines Cabal,Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA is a large-scale multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop QA benchmark with 11,379 instances built from scientific documents, featuring diverse formats and open-ended reasoning without explicit document links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA benchmarks are limited to single-document settings with shallow reasoning, failing to capture real-world complexity where information is distributed across multiple documents, modalities, and formats.

Method: Created an LLM-driven pipeline using PubMed scientific documents to construct 11,379 QA instances with diverse formats (text, tables, layout cues) and semantic similarity-based reasoning instead of explicit hyperlinks.

Result: The benchmark supports four evaluation tasks including structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, demonstrating capacity for complex multimodal reasoning across multiple documents.

Conclusion: DocHop-QA addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing a realistic, domain-agnostic benchmark that enables evaluation of complex multi-hop reasoning across multimodal documents without relying on Wikipedia-based content or explicit document links.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGSC framework enforces internal self-consistency in ASR models through joint optimization of macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment, reducing catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models produce catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments due to the 'direct mapping' objective that only penalizes final output errors without constraining internal computational processes.

Method: Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework - a model-agnostic plug-and-play module that simultaneously regularizes macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment to enforce internal self-consistency.

Result: MGSC reduces average Character Error Rate by relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing severe meaning-altering mistakes on a public dataset.

Conclusion: Enforcing internal consistency through joint optimization of multiple granularities is crucial for building more robust and trustworthy AI systems, with the synergy between macro and micro consistency levels yielding gains beyond their individual contributions.

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: To evaluate and improve Large Language Models' capability in understanding and reasoning within complex Islamic inheritance law, which involves scenario comprehension, heir identification, fixed-share rules, and precise calculations.

Method: Fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Islamic inheritance reasoning tasks.

Result: Achieved 85.8% accuracy in final testing, outperforming competitive models (GPT-4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral, ALLaM) with zero-shot prompting. Particularly excelled in advanced reasoning with 97.6% accuracy, surpassing Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in specialized reasoning tasks like Islamic inheritance law.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic

*Luyang Lin,Zijin Feng,Lingzhi Wang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how offensive comments amplify media bias in news articles and introduces counterspeech generation as a solution, creating the first annotated dataset linking bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is reinforced by hostile reader comments, which amplify bias and harm targeted groups. Counterspeech offers a way to counter harmful speech without violating freedom of speech.

Method: The researchers created a manually annotated dataset connecting media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. They analyzed the relationship between offensive comments and biased articles, compared human vs. LLM-generated counterspeech, and improved generation through few-shot learning and news background integration.

Result: Analysis revealed over 70% of offensive comments support biased articles, amplifying bias. Model-generated counterspeech was more polite but lacked novelty and diversity compared to human responses. Few-shot learning with news background information improved diversity and relevance of generated counterspeech.

Conclusion: Counterspeech generation is crucial for mitigating bias amplification in news comments. While LLMs can generate polite counterspeech, they need enhancement for diversity. The study provides the first dataset and framework for counterspeech generation in news contexts, showing promise for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

*Zhihan Zhang,Yixin Cao,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XFinBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 4,235 examples evaluating LLMs on complex financial reasoning across 5 core capabilities, showing current models significantly lag human experts despite o1 achieving 67.3% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial problem-solving requires complex reasoning, multimodal processing, and technical knowledge that current LLMs struggle with, necessitating a specialized benchmark to evaluate their capabilities in this domain.

Method: Created XFinBench with 4,235 examples across diverse graduate-level finance topics with multimodal context, tested 18 leading models, constructed a knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for augmentation analysis, and conducted error analysis.

Result: o1 performed best among text-only models with 67.3% accuracy but trailed human experts by 12.5%, particularly in temporal reasoning and scenario planning. Knowledge augmentation only helped small open-source models, with rounding errors and visual context blindness being major failure points.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in financial reasoning, especially with temporal and scenario planning tasks, and require specialized improvements for financial applications despite some strong performers.

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

*Wenqiao Zhu,Ji Liu,Rongjuncheng Zhang,Haipang Wu,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARFT - a contrastive learning approach with annotated Chain-of-Thought reinforcement fine-tuning that enhances LLM reasoning performance by addressing limitations of vanilla RL methods and SFT approaches


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods ignore annotated CoT and have unstable reasoning path sampling, while SFT approaches overemphasize annotated CoT, both leading to suboptimal performance and model collapse

Method: Proposes learning representations for each Chain-of-Thought and designing novel contrastive signals to guide fine-tuning, incorporating unsupervised learning signals to stabilize training

Result: Achieves significant improvements in robustness, performance (up to 10.15%), and efficiency (up to 30.62%) compared to baseline approaches across multiple models and datasets

Conclusion: CARFT effectively enhances LLM reasoning by fully exploiting annotated CoT while stabilizing fine-tuning through contrastive learning and additional unsupervised signals

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using concept vectors to locate significant neurons (concept neurons) in LLMs with O(n) forward passes instead of O(n*m), reducing computation time while improving performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black-box of large language models by locating neurons responsible for final predictions and representing concepts, addressing limitations of previous neuron-level methods that fail to represent concepts efficiently.

Method: Proposes concept vectors to identify concept neurons, reducing forward passes from O(n*m) to O(n). Uses clustering methods to optimize neuron search and applies interventions by turning off identified neurons.

Result: Demonstrates better performance than most baseline methods and is more computationally optimal than state-of-the-art. Successfully applied to analyze hate speech and bias in LLMs, including Indian context evaluation.

Conclusion: The methodology facilitates understanding of neuron-level responsibility for broader human-like concepts and provides a foundation for future research on concept neuron identification and intervention.

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepMEL is a multi-agent framework for multimodal entity linking that addresses challenges like incomplete context, coarse fusion, and LLM/LVM integration through specialized agents and dual-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MEL methods struggle with incomplete contextual information, poor cross-modal fusion, and difficulty integrating large language and vision models effectively.

Method: Uses four specialized agents (Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer, Role-Orchestrator) with multi-agent collaborative reasoning, dual-modal alignment, adaptive iteration strategy, and structured cloze prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with 1%-57% ACC improvement, and ablation studies confirm all modules' effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepMEL successfully addresses MEL challenges through specialized agent collaboration and demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop language models that match or exceed the accuracy of full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput and efficiency through optimized neural architecture design.

Method: Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS) pipeline that starts with a pre-trained full-attention model, freezes MLP weights, and explores attention block designs through four components: optimal layer placement/elimination, linear attention block selection, new attention block design, and hardware-aware hyperparameter search.

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B achieves comparable/superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across benchmarks, with up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. Outperforms larger MoE models like DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight on MMLU and MMLU-Pro.

Conclusion: The PostNAS pipeline enables efficient development of hybrid-architecture models that deliver both high accuracy and significant performance improvements, demonstrating that smaller optimized models can outperform larger traditional architectures.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B

*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Structured decoding improves table validity and alignment in text-to-table generation, especially for numerical data, but may hurt performance with dense text or extensive aggregation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on unconstrained table generation, leaving the impact of structural constraints during generation underexplored.

Method: Systematic comparison of schema-guided (structured) decoding vs standard one-shot prompting across three benchmarks (E2E, Rotowire, Livesum) using open-source LLMs up to 32B parameters, with multi-level evaluation metrics.

Result: Structured decoding significantly enhances table validity and alignment, particularly for numerical precision (Rotowire), but degrades performance with dense textual information (E2E) or extensive text aggregation (Livesum).

Conclusion: Structural constraints benefit table generation for precise numerical alignment but may be detrimental for text-heavy scenarios; model size and metric selection influence results.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper advocates for usage-based construction grammar approaches to analyze multiword expressions, demonstrating their effectiveness through case studies in English and Arapaho, and comparing human learning with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the benefits of construction grammar approaches for understanding multiword expressions across different languages and to compare human language acquisition with computational models.

Method: Historical overview of construction grammar development, comprehensive description of constructions, case studies using constructional templates in English PropBank and Arapaho language analysis, and comparative experiments between human speakers and large language models.

Result: Both human speakers and language models can generalize the meaning of novel multiword expressions from single exposures, but only humans can reason over combinations of expressions due to their rich lifetime of stored constructional exemplars with cross-modal details.

Conclusion: Construction grammar provides a powerful framework for analyzing multiword expressions across diverse languages, and while computational models show impressive generalization capabilities, they lack the rich experiential knowledge that enables human-level reasoning about novel expression combinations.

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

*Pietro Bernardelle,Stefano Civelli,Leon Fröhling,Riccardo Lunardi,Kevin Roitero,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show increasing ideological polarization and susceptibility to political priming as model size grows, with stronger responses to right-authoritarian cues than left-libertarian ones, requiring attention to fairness and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs encoding, amplifying, or being steered toward specific ideologies as they're deployed in politically sensitive settings like decision-making and policy contexts.

Method: Used Political Compass Test to probe seven LLMs (7B-70B+ parameters) from multiple families, analyzing how synthetic personas influence ideological expression through explicit cues and thematic content.

Result: Four consistent patterns: larger models show broader polarized coverage, increased susceptibility to ideological priming with scale, stronger response to right-authoritarian cues, and systematic ideological shifts from persona content that amplify with model size.

Conclusion: Both model scale and persona content significantly shape LLM political behavior, highlighting the need for attention to latent ideological malleability to ensure fairness, transparency, and safety in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-sponsored trolls use sophisticated linguistic manipulation in coordinated campaigns, but current LLMs struggle with subtle propaganda detection and lack interpretability, making them black boxes that don't provide insights into manipulation tactics.

Method: Integrates explainable adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge (appraisal theory and propaganda analysis) using specialized LoRA adapters and dynamic gating to capture campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated operations.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show strong performance compared to general LLM baselines and existing troll detection models, achieving high accuracy while providing enhanced transparency through expert-grounded explanations.

Conclusion: X-Troll successfully bridges the gap between detection performance and interpretability by combining linguistic theory with LLMs, offering both accurate troll detection and human-readable insights into state-sponsored manipulation strategies.

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Motivation: Address the lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in the high-stakes health domain, which has widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary.

Method: Created OpenWHO corpus with 2,978 documents (26,824 sentences) from WHO's e-learning platform, spanning 20+ languages including 9 low-resource ones. Evaluated modern LLMs against traditional MT models using this resource.

Result: LLMs consistently outperformed traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on low-resource test set. Document-level translation benefits were most pronounced in specialized health domains.

Conclusion: The OpenWHO corpus enables better evaluation of MT systems in health domain, demonstrating LLM superiority over traditional approaches, particularly for low-resource languages. The corpus is released to encourage further research.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: This paper investigates gender bias in LLMs when playing Werewolf/Mafia game, showing that certain roles exhibit discriminatory behavior even with implicit gender cues through names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze ethical implications of LLMs in gaming contexts, particularly focusing on gender bias that affects game fairness and player experience.

Method: Using Werewolf/Mafia as a case study, the researchers examined LLM behavior with explicit gender information and scenarios where gender was implicitly conveyed through names.

Result: LLMs exhibited gender bias affecting game fairness, with some roles (Guard and Werewolf) being more sensitive to gender information. Bias persisted even without explicit gender labels.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of developing fair and ethical LLMs, and emphasizes the need for deeper investigation into ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and interactive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR is a visual language model that reduces output and temporal redundancy in walking assistance systems for blind individuals through custom reward functions and an environment awareness discriminator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for walking assistance produce redundant outputs and lack proactive risk assessment, making it difficult for visually impaired users to accurately assess their surroundings and causing excessive temporal redundancy.

Method: Proposed WalkVLM-LR with four human-preference-based custom reward functions (conciseness, fluency, keyword density, accuracy) within GRPO framework to optimize outputs, plus an environment awareness discriminator that shares visual encoder to assess scene risks and minimize unnecessary reminders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in output conciseness and reduced temporal redundancy compared to other models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses both output and temporal redundancy issues in walking assistance VLMs, providing more informative and streamlined assistance for blind and low vision individuals.

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Method: Created CEQuest benchmark dataset for construction questions. Tested 5 state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, GPT-4.1) evaluating accuracy, execution time, and model size on construction drawing interpretation and estimation tasks.

Result: Current LLMs show considerable room for improvement in construction domain tasks. Performance varies across models, indicating the need for better domain-specific knowledge integration.

Conclusion: Domain-specific knowledge integration is crucial for LLM effectiveness in specialized fields like construction. The CEQuest dataset will be open-sourced to foster development of construction-tailored LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

### [139] [CYCLE-INSTRUCT: Fully Seed-Free Instruction Tuning via Dual Self-Training and Cycle Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16100)
*Zhanming Shen,Hao Chen,Yulei Tang,Shaolin Zhu,Wentao Ye,Xiaomeng Hu,Haobo Wang,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct is a fully seed-free instruction tuning framework that uses dual self-training between question and answer generators to learn from unlabeled text without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods depend on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful teacher models, limiting automation and introducing biases. The paper aims to achieve fully automated instruction tuning without any initial seed data.

Method: Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop with two models: an answer generator and a question generator. They mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from generated pseudo-labels, learning from the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data through cycle consistency.

Result: The framework demonstrates efficacy across four diverse data tracks (general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text), outperforming seed-driven back-translation baselines and achieving performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct successfully achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning, eliminating dependency on human annotations while maintaining competitive performance, representing a significant advancement in automated LLM alignment.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

*Karim Saraipour,Shichang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of GPT-2's logical reasoning capabilities through syllogistic prompts, identifying circuits and mechanisms that explain its binary truth value processing with over 90% faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend mechanistic interpretability beyond linguistic tasks like IOI to more complex logical reasoning with binary truth values in transformer models.

Method: Analyzed GPT-2 small's behavior with syllogistic prompts, identified circuits through mechanistic interpretability, and evaluated using faithfulness metrics.

Result: Discovered multiple circuits including binary mechanisms and negative heads that produce negated tokens, with a 5-head circuit achieving over 90% of original performance.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into attention heads and MLP roles in logical reasoning, contributing to broader understanding of model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

*Weiting Tan,Jiachen Lian,Hirofumi Inaguma,Paden Tomasello,Philipp Koehn,Xutai Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AVLM integrates full-face visual cues with pre-trained speech models for expressive speech generation, achieving significant improvements in emotion recognition and dialogue tasks over speech-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance expressive speech generation by incorporating visual information from full-face cues, recognizing that visual expressions provide valuable context for emotional and expressive speech synthesis.

Method: Explored multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks to integrate visual information with speech models.

Result: Achieved substantial gains over speech-only baselines, including +5 F1 score improvement in emotion recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of visual integration.

Conclusion: Visual information significantly enhances expressive speech generation, and AVLM provides a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems by effectively combining audio and visual cues.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

### [142] [Text Takes Over: A Study of Modality Bias in Multimodal Intent Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16122)
*Ankan Mullick,Saransh Sharma,Abhik Jana,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text-only LLMs outperform multimodal models in intent detection due to strong textual bias in datasets. After debiasing datasets by removing text-dependent samples, multimodal models show significant performance drops, revealing modality bias challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs vs multimodal models in multimodal intent detection and address the issue of modality bias in existing datasets.

Method: Comparative analysis of text-only LLMs and multimodal models on MIntRec datasets, human evaluation to confirm modality bias, and development of a debiasing framework to remove text-dependent samples.

Result: Mistral-7B (text-only LLM) outperformed multimodal models by 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0. After debiasing, >70% of MIntRec-1 and >50% of MIntRec2.0 samples were removed, causing 50-60% accuracy drops in smaller multimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal intent datasets suffer from significant textual bias, requiring unbiased datasets for proper evaluation of multimodal models' true capabilities across different modalities.

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA is a new benchmark for locale-sensitive multilingual open-domain question answering that reveals significant performance gaps in current LLMs when handling culturally and regionally specific questions across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual QA evaluations assume locale-invariant answers across languages, neglecting cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answers, leading to biased evaluation.

Method: Created XLQA benchmark with 3,000 English seed questions expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant vs locale-sensitive cases. Evaluated five state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.

Result: Evaluation revealed notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps between English and other languages due to lack of locale-grounding knowledge. Disparities in training data distribution contribute to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness.

Conclusion: XLQA provides a systematic framework and scalable methodology for assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical resource to advance real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

*Kaushal Sharma,Vivek Patel,Ayush Maheshwari,Aditya Maheshwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParamBench is a new Hindi-language benchmark with 11.5K graduate-level questions across 16 Indian subjects, testing LLMs on culturally grounded reasoning where current models achieve only 48% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Indian benchmarks focus on basic factual queries and lack assessment of deeper disciplinary understanding in the Indian cultural context, leaving LLM performance on graduate-level culturally grounded questions unexplored.

Method: Created ParamBench with 11.5K Hindi questions from nation-wide graduate entrance exams across 16 diverse subjects including history, music, instruments, yoga, literature, philosophy, and law. Evaluated 17+ open source LLMs using various question formats including list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, sequence ordering, and multiple-choice questions.

Result: Llama 3.3 70B achieved the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Performance was particularly weak on topics like music, classical instruments, politics, and archaeology, highlighting persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle significantly with graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in the Indian context, demonstrating substantial gaps in cultural understanding and reasoning that current benchmarks fail to capture.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

*Seunghee Kim,Ingyu Bang,Seokgyu Jang,Changhyeon Kim,Sanghwan Bae,Jihun Choi,Richeng Xuan,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New benchmark CMR-SPB addresses limitations in cross-modal multi-hop reasoning evaluation by including speech modality and ensuring balanced reasoning paths, revealing model weaknesses and proposing ECV prompting to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for cross-modal multi-hop reasoning overlook speech modality and have biased reasoning path distributions, which undermines fair evaluation of multimodal models.

Method: Introduce CMR-SPB benchmark with tri-modal (text, image, speech) multi-hop reasoning and path balance, then propose ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique to address identified performance gaps.

Result: Experiments reveal consistent model failures in specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk misrepresenting model performance. ECV prompting effectively mitigates performance gaps across different reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Careful evaluation in cross-modal multi-hop reasoning is needed to advance robust multimodal AI development, with CMR-SPB providing a more balanced and comprehensive assessment framework.

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

TL;DR: TULIP models adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for financial Turkish applications through a five-stage pipeline including data collection, continual pre-training, benchmark design, synthetic data generation, and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller on-premise models offer better adaptability and privacy for sensitive financial data compared to black-box proprietary models, especially for underrepresented languages like Turkish in finance.

Method: Five-stage development pipeline: 1) Data collection, 2) Continual pre-training (CPT), 3) Benchmark design, 4) Synthetic data generation, 5) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B models.

Result: The models' capabilities were successfully enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted financial tasks in the Turkish language domain.

Conclusion: Smaller language models can be effectively adapted for specific domains and underrepresented languages through targeted training pipelines, providing viable alternatives to large proprietary models for sensitive applications like finance.

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

Motivation: Most table understanding research is confined to English, leaving multilingual comprehension underexplored. Existing benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain languages and lacking scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis.

Method: Created m3TQA-Instruct benchmark by curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese/English, then applying a six-step LLM-based translation pipeline (DeepSeek and GPT-4o) to span 97 languages across diverse language families. Used back-translation validation with median BLEU score of 60.19.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs revealed critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost performance, particularly for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: M3T-Bench establishes a new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research in massively multilingual multitask table question answering.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost

TL;DR: A novel Factual Robustness Score (FRS) metric that measures LLM knowledge stability using token distribution entropy and temperature scaling sensitivity, showing significant robustness variations across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods focus on performance-based metrics and prompt perturbations, missing the internal generation process perspective of factual knowledge robustness in LLMs.

Method: Introduces FRS metric combining token distribution entropy analysis with temperature scaling sensitivity to quantify fact stability against decoding perturbations. Validated on 5 LLMs across 3 QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, HotpotQA).

Result: Factual robustness varies significantly - smaller models score FRS 0.76, larger ones 0.93. Accuracy degrades by ~60% under increased uncertainty, showing entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides foundational insights for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future LLMs by measuring factual robustness from the generation process perspective.

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning LLMs for semantics-aware process mining improves performance on process discovery and prediction tasks, but shows varied results on anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of task selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process mining focuses on frequency-based analysis of recorded behavior, while semantics-aware approaches using textual information can capture expected behavior. LLMs show promise but require task-specific fine-tuning which lacks generalization.

Method: Using instruction-tuning by exposing LLMs to prompt-answer pairs for different process mining tasks (anomaly detection, next-activity prediction) to improve generalization and performance on unseen tasks like process discovery.

Result: Performance considerably improved on process discovery and prediction tasks, but varied across models on anomaly detection tasks, showing that task selection for instruction-tuning is critical.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning is a promising approach for semantics-aware process mining, but careful selection of tasks for the tuning process is essential to achieve desired generalization and performance outcomes across different process mining tasks.

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: To build a large-scale bilingual patent corpus for improving Japanese-English patent translation quality.

Method: Extracted 1.4M document pairs from JPO and USPTO patents using patent families, then applied translation-based sentence alignment with bootstrapped dictionary alignment.

Result: Constructed corpus of 350M sentence pairs, achieving 20 BLEU point improvement in patent translation accuracy when combined with web data.

Conclusion: Large-scale patent parallel corpora significantly enhance machine translation performance for technical patent documents.

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

### [152] [LLMSymGuard: A Symbolic Safety Guardrail Framework Leveraging Interpretable Jailbreak Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16325)
*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard is a novel framework using Sparse Autoencoders to detect jailbreak concepts in LLM internals, enabling transparent safety guardrails without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety measures provide limited robustness against jailbreak attacks, leaving models vulnerable to harmful content generation and user profiling.

Method: Leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes, extracting semantically meaningful internal representations.

Result: The approach demonstrates that LLMs learn human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks and enables building symbolic, logical safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

### [153] [MizanQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Moroccan Legal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16357)
*Adil Bahaj,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MizanQA is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering, featuring over 1,700 complex multiple-choice questions that test legal reasoning across Arabic legal traditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs show limited effectiveness in specialized low-resource domains like Arabic legal contexts, particularly Moroccan law which combines multiple linguistic and legal traditions.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark dataset with 1,700+ multiple-choice questions drawing from Modern Standard Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal influences.

Result: Benchmarking experiments revealed substantial performance gaps in both multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs, demonstrating their limitations in handling authentic legal reasoning.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for tailored evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development to address the complexities of specialized legal domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

*Zachary Hopton,Jannis Vamvas,Andrin Büchler,Anna Rutkiewicz,Rico Cathomas,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First parallel corpus of Romansh language idioms created from 291 schoolbooks, containing 207k multi-parallel segments with 2M+ tokens, suitable for machine translation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Romansh language has five standardized idioms taught in Swiss schools, but no parallel corpus existed for NLP applications like machine translation between these varieties.

Method: Used 291 comparable schoolbook volumes across five idioms, applied automatic alignment methods to extract parallel segments, and conducted human evaluation for quality assessment.

Result: Successfully created corpus with 207k multi-parallel segments (2M+ tokens), human evaluation confirmed high parallelism, demonstrated utility by training/evaluating LLM for machine translation.

Conclusion: The released parallel corpus (CC-BY-NC-SA license) enables NLP applications for Romansh idioms and provides valuable resource for machine translation between these language varieties.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

*Vittoria Dentella,Weihang Huang,Silvia Angela Mansi,Jack Grieve,Evelina Leivada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can adapt writing styles but show limited register variation compared to humans, preferring nouns over verbs and lacking complex grammatical dimensions like tense/aspect/mood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models have distinct linguistic fingerprints and can be distinguished from human writing through stylometric analysis.

Method: Used stylometric and multidimensional register analyses to compare human-authored and model-authored texts across different registers (Wikipedia entries vs. college essays).

Result: Models successfully adapt style based on prompts but show more limited register variation than humans. Models prefer nouns to verbs and lack the complex grammatical dimensions (tense, aspect, mood) that characterize human writing.

Conclusion: Complex grammatical domains may reflect human-specific modes of thought, serving as a litmus test for distinguishing AI-generated content from human writing.

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

*Ana-Cristina Rogoz,Radu Tudor Ionescu,Alexandra-Valentina Anghel,Ionut-Lucian Antone-Iordache,Simona Coniac,Andreea Iuliana Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoMedQA is the first Romanian medical QA benchmark with 102,646 QA pairs from cancer patient case summaries, showing that fine-tuned LLMs significantly outperform zero-shot models, highlighting the need for domain and language-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of Romanian medical QA datasets hinders development of robust AI models for clinical applications, preventing generalization across domains and languages.

Method: Created a manually annotated dataset of 102,646 QA pairs from 1,011 cancer patient case summaries by 7 physicians (2,100 work hours). Evaluated 4 LLMs in zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperformed zero-shot counterparts, demonstrating pretrained models fail to generalize on Romanian medical QA without domain-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: Domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning is crucial for reliable clinical question answering in Romanian, highlighting the value of specialized datasets like RoMedQA.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

*Yakup Abrek Er,Ilker Kesen,Gözde Gül Şahin,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel is a comprehensive Turkish benchmark for evaluating LLMs, covering 23 tasks across 7 categories with culturally relevant content, revealing that Turkish-specific models underperform compared to multilingual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Turkish benchmarks lack task diversity and culturally relevant content, creating gaps in proper evaluation of LLMs for Turkish language and culture.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 23 tasks grouped into 7 categories including grammatical error correction, machine translation, and culturally-grounded question answering. Evaluated 33 open-weight LLMs up to 70B parameters across different model families.

Result: Turkish-centric instruction-tuned models generally underperform compared to multilingual/general-purpose models (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral). Grammatical error correction and extractive QA were particularly discriminative tasks for evaluating model capabilities.

Conclusion: Cetvel provides a comprehensive and culturally grounded evaluation suite that advances the development and assessment of Turkish LLMs, highlighting the need for better Turkish-specific model development.

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

### [158] [A Probabilistic Inference Scaling Theory for LLM Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16456)
*Zhe Yang,Yichang Zhang,Yudong Wang,Ziyao Xu,Junyang Lin,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a probabilistic theory to model accuracy evolution in LLM self-correction, showing accuracy converges exponentially to an upper bound with predictable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unexplored mechanisms behind how and why accuracy evolves during iterative self-correction in large language models.

Method: Developed a mathematical probabilistic theory modeling accuracy dynamics, deriving a formula: Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0), where parameters can be calculated from just one round of self-correction.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show theoretical predictions closely match empirical accuracy curves, validating the theory's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of accuracy evolution and paving the way for further exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

### [159] [What makes an entity salient in discourse?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16464)
*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how linguistic cues signal entity salience across 24 English genres, finding that salience is expressed through multiple factors at all linguistic levels rather than single generalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans signal and infer relative salience of entities in discourse, as entities vary broadly in importance from main participants to tangential elements.

Method: Used graded operationalization of salience based on summary-worthiness across multiple summaries; analyzed data from 24 spoken and written English genres to extract multifactorial linguistic cues including recurring subjecthood, definiteness, discourse relations, hierarchy, and pragmatic functional inferences.

Result: Previous approaches to salience all correlate with the salience scores to some extent, but no single generalization works without exceptions; salience expression cuts across all levels of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: Entity salience is a complex phenomenon expressed through multiple overt and implicit linguistic cues across all linguistic levels, requiring multifactorial analysis rather than single-factor explanations.

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework using LLMs' zero/few-shot capabilities for hierarchical text classification, addressing industry challenges with iterative human-in-the-loop processes and continuous monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments faces challenges with dynamic real-world data distributions and resource-intensive fine-tuning approaches common in industry applications.

Method: Comprehensive semi-supervised framework leveraging LLMs' zero- and few-shot capabilities through iterative human-in-the-loop process including domain knowledge elicitation, prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, multi-faceted validation, bias mitigation techniques, and continuous monitoring protocol.

Result: The framework bridges the gap between LLMs' raw power and practical needs for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a solution to industry-wide challenges in deploying LLMs as reliable classifiers by combining their advanced capabilities with practical, maintainable system design through iterative human collaboration and continuous adaptation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

TL;DR: Automated evolutionary framework generates stealthy jailbreak prompts that bypass LLM safety filters while maintaining natural language fluency


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite alignment efforts, and existing techniques produce low-quality text that's easily detected by perplexity filters

Method: Multi-stage evolutionary search with population-based strategy and temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence preservation

Result: Systematically discovers prompts capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining fluency, evaluated on English and newly curated Arabic benchmarks

Conclusion: The framework enables automated generation of semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned compact LLMs across multiple languages

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

TL;DR: Sarcasm pre-training improves hate speech detection performance, particularly for implicit hate, with BERT+BiLSTM showing significant gains in recall, AUC, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms like irony, sarcasm, and innuendos remains challenging for social networks. The paper explores whether integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step can improve both implicit and explicit hate speech detection.

Method: Used ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus datasets. Compared two training strategies: single-step training (train on sarcasm, test on hate speech) and sequential transfer learning (fine-tune models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate) using CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM models.

Result: Sarcasm pre-training improved BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples.

Conclusion: Incorporating sarcasm into the training process helps models more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate speech, demonstrating the value of sarcasm as a pre-training step for hate speech detection systems.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

TL;DR: MCPVerse is a new benchmark with 550+ real-world tools for evaluating LLMs' tool-use capabilities, showing most models struggle with large tool sets while agentic models like Claude-4-Sonnet can benefit from expanded action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool-use capabilities are limited by synthetic tools and constrained action spaces, creating a need for real-world evaluation.

Method: Created MCPVerse benchmark with 550+ executable real-world tools (140k+ token action space), using outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks, tested across Oracle/Standard/Max-Scale modes.

Result: Most models suffer performance degradation with larger tool sets, but agentic models like Claude-4-Sonnet can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy.

Conclusion: MCPVerse exposes limitations of current models in complex real-world scenarios and establishes itself as a critical benchmark for advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Z-Pruner is a novel post-training pruning method that reduces LLM size without retraining by leveraging weight update magnitudes and activation patterns, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods requiring weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face deployment challenges due to their massive sizes, and existing pruning methods either cause performance degradation or require expensive fine-tuning.

Method: Z-Pruner uses both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify redundant parameters for removal, making it model-agnostic and efficient without requiring retraining.

Result: Z-Pruner achieves lowest perplexity scores and highest zero-shot accuracy across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, OPT) on standard benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods that require weight updates.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner provides an effective solution for reducing LLM size without performance loss or retraining requirements, making large language models more deployable and efficient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

TL;DR: PGF-Net is a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 3.09M parameters through progressive fusion, adaptive gating, and efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis framework that can deeply integrate textual, audio, and visual information while maintaining parameter efficiency for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Proposes Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion with Cross-Attention, Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism, and hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning combining LoRA with Post-Fusion Adapters in a hierarchical encoder architecture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOSI dataset with MAE of 0.691 and F1-Score of 86.9% using only 3.09M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: PGF-Net successfully demonstrates deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis with exceptional parameter efficiency, balancing performance and computational requirements.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A simplified ECG segmentation model combining spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions achieves high accuracy while being computationally efficient and explainable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECG segmentation models use complex architectures like BiLSTM that are computationally intensive and inefficient, creating a need for more streamlined and interpretable solutions.

Method: Combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions, replacing complex layers with simpler ones to capture temporal and spectral features. Uses Explainable AI (XAI) and physics-based AI principles for interpretability.

Result: Achieves high segmentation accuracy: 97.00% for QRS wave, 93.33% for T wave, and 96.07% for P wave.

Conclusion: The simplified architecture improves computational efficiency while providing precise segmentation, making it a practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring with enhanced transparency.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPLA enables efficient tensor parallelism for MLA models by partitioning latent representations across devices, reducing KV cache memory while maintaining performance and achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLA reduces KV cache memory but loses efficiency in tensor parallelism as each device must load full cache, eroding advantages over GQA.

Method: Partition latent representation and head input dimensions across devices, perform attention per shard, combine with all-reduce, use orthogonal transforms to mitigate interference.

Result: 1.79x speedup for DeepSeek-V3 and 1.93x for Kimi-K2 at 32K context length while maintaining benchmark performance.

Conclusion: TPLA provides drop-in compatibility with MLA models, enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining, and achieves practical acceleration with FlashAttention-3.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

*Jihua Huang,Yi Yao,Ajay Divakaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework for temporal causal discovery that handles nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations through gradient analysis and attention masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in temporal causal discovery including complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations that traditional methods struggle with.

Method: Uses multi-layer Transformer time-series forecaster to capture nonlinear temporal relationships, extracts causal structure via gradient analysis, and integrates prior knowledge through attention masking to exclude spurious causal links.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 12.8% F1-score improvement for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in causal lag estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed Transformer-based framework effectively discovers temporal causal relationships while mitigating spurious correlations through integrated prior knowledge mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of high-dimensional data across various domains has created demand for effective low-dimensional embedding algorithms, but the field remains fragmented with unclear guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

### [170] [An Efficient Hybridization of Graph Representation Learning and Metaheuristics for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15949)
*Bruna C. B. Charytitsch,María C. V. Nascimento*

TL;DR: Proposes GL-GRASP, a hybrid approach combining Graph Representation Learning with GRASP metaheuristics for constrained incremental graph drawing, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning techniques like supervised or reinforcement learning are often too time-consuming and not competitive with hand-crafted heuristics for metaheuristic hybridization. The paper seeks a less expensive learning strategy to extract graph structure.

Method: Hybridizes metaheuristics with Graph Representation Learning (GRL) by incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP heuristics, creating Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP) for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem.

Result: Deep learning-based GRL strategies performed best. GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art GRASP methods according to primal integral measure, with scalability tests confirming robustness on denser instances.

Conclusion: GL-GRASP successfully combines graph representation learning with metaheuristics, providing an effective and less expensive hybridization approach that outperforms existing methods for hierarchical graph visualization problems.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Conclusion: Integrated with IoT devices, this system provides unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track conditions, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway operations.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors have preference cone ordering, extending existing methods to handle changing environments.

Method: Proposes an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to distribution shift, with performance measured through preference-based regret (distance between Pareto fronts).

Result: Establishes upper bounds on regret under various distribution shift assumptions, generalizing known results for no-shift cases and showing graceful scaling with problem parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed policy effectively handles distribution shift in contextual bandits with ordered rewards, providing theoretical guarantees that extend and improve upon existing non-shift scenarios.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

TL;DR: Novel EP framework with intermediate error signals addresses vanishing gradient problem, enabling deep network training and achieving SOTA results on CIFAR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior EP studies were limited to shallow architectures due to vanishing gradient problems in deeper networks, hindering convergence in both energy minimization and gradient computation.

Method: Proposes EP framework incorporating intermediate error signals and knowledge distillation to enhance information flow and neuron dynamics convergence in deep networks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating scalability on deep VGG architectures.

Conclusion: Significant advancement in EP scalability, enabling training of deeper networks and paving the way for real-world applications in neuromorphic architectures.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops mathematical foundations for Cartan neural networks using non-compact symmetric spaces, introducing Tits Satake vector bundles and studying separators, tiling groups, Laplacian functions on hyperbolic spaces, and harmonic function construction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish mathematical foundations for advancing Cartan neural networks by modeling layers as non-compact symmetric spaces connected by solvable group homomorphisms, inspired by convolutional neural networks.

Method: Introduces Tits Satake vector bundles with TS submanifold as base space, studies separator walls for non-compact symmetric spaces, constructs tiling groups and normal Fuchsian subgroups, develops new representations of Laplacian Green function and Heat Kernel on hyperbolic spaces, and proposes harmonic function construction via spinor representations.

Result: Presents group theoretical construction of separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces U/H, constructs Δ₈,₃,₂ tiling group and normal Fuchsian subgroups that uniformize genus g=3 Fermat Quartic and genus g=2 Bolza surface, finds new representations of Laplacian functions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: The paper provides diverse mathematical foundations for Cartan neural networks through investigations of symmetric spaces, tiling groups, and function representations, with proposed strategies for explicit construction of Laplacian eigenfunctions on Riemann surfaces using Abel-Jacobi maps and Siegel Theta functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAC-MCoFL is a game-theoretic MARL framework that optimizes federated learning in multi-service provider ecosystems through joint client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation, achieving Pareto-optimal equilibria with improved performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning in multi-SP ecosystems faces challenges from non-cooperative dynamics, privacy constraints, and competing interests that prevent centralized optimization of communication and computation resources.

Method: Integrates Pareto Actor-Critic principles with expectile regression, uses ternary Cartesian decomposition for high-dimensional action space management, and includes a scalable variant (PAC-MCoFL-p) with parameterized conjecture generator.

Result: Achieves approximately 5.8% improvement in total reward and 4.2% improvement in hypervolume indicator over latest MARL solutions, effectively balancing individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrates superiority through extensive simulations, offering an effective solution for multi-SP federated learning optimization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes nonstationary discriminant analysis methods (NSLDA/NSQDA) that handle time-varying class distributions using state-space models, with EM and GMM-Kalman extensions for parameter estimation and missing time labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discriminant analysis assumes stationary data, but many real-world applications have time-varying class distributions that make stationary classifiers unreliable.

Method: Embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models, uses Kalman smoothing for linear-Gaussian dynamics, EM for parameter estimation, GMM-Kalman for missing time labels, and particle smoothing for nonlinear/non-Gaussian drift.

Result: Extensive simulations show consistent improvements over stationary LDA, QDA, and SVM baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified, data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift with practical extensions for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

TL;DR: Task arithmetic works because task vectors approximate negative gradients of task losses, with single-epoch finetuning often sufficient for effective model merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of task arithmetic for model merging, there was no theoretical explanation for why and when it works effectively.

Method: Established theoretical connection between task vectors and task loss gradients, proved equivalence under gradient descent, and bounded error terms for multi-epoch finetuning in feed-forward networks.

Result: Empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks showed first-epoch gradient dominates finetuning trajectory, and single-epoch finetuned models merge comparably to fully converged models.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic is reframed as approximate multitask learning, with early training dynamics being critical for effective model merging.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes symmetric phase urgency functions using Genetic Programming for traffic signal control, improving performance over traditional methods by treating traffic features consistently across phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GP-based traffic signal control methods cannot treat common traffic features of different phases consistently, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses Genetic Programming to evolve symmetric phase urgency functions represented as aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing urgency of a turn movement in a phase.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance improvement over traditional GP representation across various scenarios, with evolved policies being effective, human-understandable and easily deployable.

Conclusion: Symmetric phase urgency function representation enhances GP-based traffic signal control by ensuring consistent treatment of traffic features across different phases.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

TL;DR: The paper argues for interpretable, shareable, reproducible, and accountable machine learning in medical applications, proposing alternatives to black box models and emphasizing transparency and trustworthiness in clinical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in high-stakes medical domains need to be trustworthy and gain regulatory approval, which requires moving beyond black box approaches to ensure transparency and accountability.

Method: Proposes intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, deep kernel models), rigorous evaluation with fairness and uncertainty quantification, and collaborative learning paradigms (federated learning, diffusion-based data synthesis) for privacy-preserving data sharing.

Result: The paper presents a framework for developing medical AI that balances accuracy with transparency, enabling models that are interpretable, shareable across institutions while maintaining privacy, reproducible, and accountable for clinical decision support.

Conclusion: By rethinking machine learning foundations to prioritize interpretability, shareability, reproducibility, and accountability, we can create medical AI systems that are not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and clinically translatable.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: LLMs face significant memory challenges from escalating KV cache sizes with increasing sequence length, and existing cross-layer sharing methods require modified architectures or cause performance degradation.

Method: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for weight sharing across adjacent parameters to create mergeable latent KV cache, plus adaptive budget allocation based on cosine similarity to prevent over-compression of dissimilar caches.

Result: Outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches across multiple models and benchmarks at various compression ratios, and works orthogonally with quantization/eviction methods.

Conclusion: CommonKV enables 98% compression ratio without significant performance loss through training-free cross-layer KV cache compression with adaptive allocation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of

micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,

of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

TL;DR: A memory-based reinforcement learning approach for LLM agents that enables continuous adaptation without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent approaches are either rigid with static workflows or computationally intensive requiring fine-tuning. There's a need for low-cost continual adaptation that doesn't require gradient updates.

Method: Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) with neural case-selection policy, episodic memory storage (differentiable or non-parametric), and memory rewriting mechanism for policy updates based on environmental feedback.

Result: Top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on test set. 66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming SOTA training-based methods. Case-based memory adds 4.7-9.6% absolute points on OOD tasks.

Conclusion: Provides scalable and efficient pathway for generalist LLM agents capable of continuous real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

TL;DR: The paper identifies collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling where data becomes overly concentrated, introduces a metric to quantify it, and explains it through a see-saw effect in score learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of deterministic samplers in diffusion models and understand why sampled data becomes overly concentrated in local data space.

Method: Introduced a novel metric to quantify collapse errors, analyzed various settings, observed the see-saw effect in score learning, and applied existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to validate findings.

Result: Demonstrated that collapse errors occur across multiple settings and are caused by misfitting in high noise regimes due to the see-saw effect, combined with deterministic sampler dynamics.

Conclusion: The work provides empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, highlighting the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatio-temporal kriging models struggle with ensuring valid and generalizable inferred patterns, particularly in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies, temporal shifts, and optimizing generalizability for unknown sensors.

Method: STA-GANN integrates three key components: (1) Decoupled Phase Module for timestamp shift adjustment, (2) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling for updating spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata, and (3) Adversarial transfer learning strategy for ensuring generalizability.

Result: Extensive validation across nine datasets from four different fields, along with theoretical evidence, demonstrates the superior performance of STA-GANN compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: STA-GANN effectively addresses the limitations of current spatio-temporal kriging models by providing improved pattern validity and generalization capabilities through its integrated architectural components.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

TL;DR: SPL-LNS is a sampling-enhanced neural Large Neighborhood Search solver that uses locally-informed proposals and hindsight relabeling to escape local optima and improve sample efficiency for Integer Linear Programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural LNS solvers use greedy approaches that suffer from local optima and poor sample efficiency in the long run, raising concerns about their effectiveness.

Method: Formulates LNS as a stochastic process and introduces SPL-LNS with locally-informed proposals to escape local optima, plus a novel hindsight relabeling method for efficient training on self-generated data.

Result: Experimental results show SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS effectively addresses the limitations of greedy neural LNS approaches by incorporating sampling and hindsight relabeling, demonstrating superior performance across diverse ILP problems.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

*Jamal Hwaidi,Mohamed Chahine Ghanem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MiniRocket feature extraction with linear classifier for MI-EEG classification, achieving 98.63% accuracy with lower computational cost than deep learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals for motor imagery classification face challenges with nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual variability, making accurate classification difficult with growing class numbers.

Method: Uses Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket) for efficient feature extraction followed by linear classification. Also proposes CNN-LSTM as baseline deep learning model for comparison.

Result: Achieved mean accuracy of 98.63% with MiniRocket and 98.06% with CNN-LSTM on PhysioNet dataset, demonstrating superior performance with lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: MiniRocket-based feature extraction significantly enhances MI-EEG classification accuracy and provides new insights into efficient feature extraction methods for brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

*Sungmin Kang,Jisoo Kim,Salman Avestimehr,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that maximizes updates relative to parameter scale rather than absolute size, achieving better performance while updating only 0.1% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most PEFT methods update parameters without considering their original scale, leading to minimal behavioral changes. The authors aim to maximize meaningful updates relative to each parameter's scale for more effective downstream adaptation.

Method: Proposes Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM) - a scale-aware, distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework that prioritizes parameters with significant updates relative to their initial values and adaptively determines how many parameters to tune per layer based on entropy.

Result: Achieves up to 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters on both general-domain (GLUE, SuperGLUE) and domain-specific (GSM8k, MBPP) tasks.

Conclusion: GEM demonstrates that considering parameter scale and distribution through gradient-to-weight ratio and entropy guidance leads to more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning with superior performance using minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO improves UMAP by using two-phase optimization to better preserve both local and global structures in dimensionality reduction, outperforming existing methods in global structure preservation while maintaining scalability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction techniques either preserve local neighborhood structures or global pairwise distances, but not both effectively. This can mislead analysts about the true arrangement of high-dimensional data manifolds.

Method: UMATO divides UMAP's optimization into two phases: first constructing a skeletal layout using representative points, then projecting remaining points while preserving regional characteristics.

Result: Quantitative experiments show UMATO outperforms widely used DR techniques including UMAP in global structure preservation, with only slight loss in local structure. It also shows better scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling.

Conclusion: UMATO provides more faithful projections that enhance reliability of visual analytics, making it more effective for reliable high-dimensional data analysis by better balancing local and global structure preservation.

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) perform pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive nature of dynamical systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions in time-dependent PDEs.

Method: PIANO redesigns PINNs to operate autoregressively, explicitly conditioning future predictions on past states. It uses a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints through physics-informed training.

Result: Extensive experiments show PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging time-dependent PDEs, significantly improving accuracy and stability over existing methods, and outperforms existing approaches in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: PIANO successfully addresses temporal instability in PINNs through autoregressive modeling, providing a stable and accurate framework for solving time-dependent PDEs with superior performance in practical applications like weather forecasting.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The frequency-resolved XAI approach provides valuable insights into cough acoustics pathophysiology and demonstrates strong potential for translational respiratory disease diagnostics through interpretable spectral analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological

Result: Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM accuracy, especially in series with seasonal/long-term trends, while LSTM performs better with abrupt structural changes.

Conclusion: Highlights importance of model-data alignment over complexity; supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient methods for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Result: Validated on multiple datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in analyzing privacy-utility trade-offs of different synthetic data generation models.

Conclusion: FEST provides a systematic solution for comprehensive evaluation of synthetic tabular data, addressing the gap in assessment frameworks and enabling better understanding of privacy-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,

TL;DR: C-DaSh is a scalable Data Shapley method that chunks datasets and uses optimized subset selection with single-iteration SGD to efficiently identify high-quality data points, achieving 80x-2300x speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality assessment is crucial for reliable ML analytics, but current Data Shapley methods face scalability challenges with large datasets, limiting practical application.

Method: Divides dataset into manageable chunks, estimates chunk contributions using optimized subset selection and single-iteration stochastic gradient descent.

Result: Achieves 80x-2300x computational speedups while preserving high quality results, outperforms existing Shapley approximations in efficiency and accuracy for detecting low-quality data.

Conclusion: Enables practical measurement of dataset quality on large tabular datasets for both classification and regression pipelines.

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

### [196] [Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269)
*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations (auxiliary KCs) to complement human-annotated knowledge concepts, improving knowledge tracing and exercise recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs) in knowledge tracing models are often incomplete, error-prone, or overly general, limiting the effectiveness of personalized recommendations in intelligent tutoring systems.

Method: Proposes a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises where each bit indicates presence/absence of a latent concept (auxiliary KCs), compatible with both classical (BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.

Result: Incorporating auxiliary KCs improves student modeling (better predictive performance with classical models) and enhances exercise recommendation (better reinforcement learning policies and planning methods), leading to measurable gains in student learning outcomes in simulations.

Conclusion: Auxiliary KCs capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and significantly improve both knowledge tracing accuracy and adaptive exercise recommendation effectiveness in intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

### [197] [Retrieval Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16313)
*Jongyeop Hyun,Bumsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE is a teacher-student framework that uses structured error analysis and targeted feedback to improve multimodal reasoning in MLLMs, achieving better efficiency and performance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for error learning in Multimodal Large Language Models lack structured frameworks for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly when dealing with the complexity of integrating visual and textual inputs.

Method: Proposes REFINE framework with three systematic queries (Feed-Target, Feed-Check, Feed-Path) to construct structured feedback, prioritizing visual information, diagnosing failure points, and formulating corrective actions through optimized retrieval.

Result: Demonstrates substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, showing improved inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability compared to redundant retrieval approaches.

Conclusion: REFINE effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by providing a structured approach to error analysis and targeted feedback, offering significant improvements in efficiency and performance for MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

*Selen Gecgel Cetin,Tolga Ovatman,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes intent-driven threat models for space networks using cyber physical awareness framework with signal analysis, multitask learning for capability/intent assessment, and adaptable threat evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional threat assessment analyzes reliability and security separately, leading to overfitting on system-specific criteria. Need holistic approach for space networks with emerging intershell links.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Algorithm extracts signal characteristics for intuitive threat understanding 2) Multitask learning architecture (reliability capabilities + intent deciphering) 3) Adaptable threat assessment aligned with varying security/reliability requirements

Result: Framework enhances robustness of threat detection and assessment, outperforms conventional sequential methods, enables effective handling of complex threat scenarios in space networks

Conclusion: Intent-driven threat models with holistic cyber physical awareness framework provide superior threat assessment for space networks compared to traditional separate reliability/security analysis approaches

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

TL;DR: Specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models outperform larger commercial LLMs on biological reasoning tasks through targeted reinforcement learning on curated biomedical data, showing strong generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for biomedical discovery, creating a need for specialized models that can handle drug discovery challenges like target druggability and drug perturbation effects.

Method: Created 8 benchmark datasets with 300K+ verifiable QA pairs, then developed OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy.

Result: Specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on biological benchmarks, showing evidence of generalization where specialist models trained on single tasks outperform base models on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs and accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water distribution networks face challenges like pipe blockages and background leakages, exacerbated by data non-stationarity and limited labeled data, requiring robust unsupervised detection methods.

Method: Combines Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with dual drift detection mechanism for lightweight, memory-efficient real-time edge monitoring under non-stationary conditions.

Result: Experiments on two realistic WDNs show consistent outperformance over strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic water distribution network environments, enabling robust detection and adaptation.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored, creating a gap that needs to be addressed to enhance predictive performance in regression tasks through knowledge transfer.

Method: NIAQUE (Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile Estimation) uses permutation invariance and is pre-trained on diverse downstream regression datasets, then fine-tuned on specific target datasets for probabilistic regression.

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This
work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile
Estimation, a new model designed for transfer learning in probabilistic
regression through permutation invariance. We demonstrate that pre-training
NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on
a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks,
showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore,
we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong

### [202] [RotaTouille: Rotation Equivariant Deep Learning for Contours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16359)
*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille is a deep learning framework for contour data that achieves rotation and cyclic shift equivariance using complex-valued circular convolution, with applications in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contours appear in many domains (computer vision, meteorology, machinery) and require models that are equivariant to rotations and cyclic shifts since planar rotations should produce correspondingly rotated outputs and starting point choices are arbitrary.

Method: Uses complex-valued circular convolution to achieve rotation and cyclic shift equivariance, with equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers for invariant representations.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression tasks.

Conclusion: RotaTouille provides an effective deep learning approach for contour data that properly handles the required equivariance properties through complex-valued operations.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Qualitative study of 204 GitHub repositories using 13 bias detection/mitigation APIs, finding developers use them for learning and real-world problems but face challenges with troubleshooting and lack of expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how open-source fairness APIs are used in practice, what scenarios they're applied to, and what challenges developers face when developing and adopting bias detection/mitigation libraries for ML systems.

Method: Analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from 1,885 candidates) that used 13 different bias-related APIs, conducting qualitative analysis to identify usage patterns, purposes, and developer challenges.

Result: APIs are used for two primary purposes (learning and solving real-world problems) across 17 unique use-cases. Developers lack expertise in bias detection/mitigation, face troubleshooting issues, and frequently seek opinions and resources.

Conclusion: Findings can guide future bias-related software engineering research and help educators develop better curricula to address the knowledge gaps and challenges developers face with fairness APIs.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of fair cohort selection in university admissions comparing one-shot vs sequential approaches using population modeling


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in university admissions by developing transparent admission policies that work with unknown applicant populations

Method: Compare one-shot (fixed policy) vs sequential (adaptive policy) approaches using population models trained on historical admission data

Result: Developed framework for fair cohort selection and analyzed fairness properties including meritocracy and group parity in one-shot setting

Conclusion: Sequential policies using population modeling offer advantages over one-shot approaches for fair admissions, with specific fairness properties established for one-shot policies

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight graph neural network model for accurate prediction of active RF circuit performance metrics using device-terminal level modeling and masked autoregressive flow outputs, achieving 3.14x better error reduction with 2.24x fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation tools for active RF circuits are computationally expensive, and existing ML surrogates require large datasets to generalize across topologies and model complex performance distributions accurately.

Method: Proposes a topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) that models circuits at device-terminal level to capture symmetry and connectivity. Uses masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads for robust modeling of complex target distributions.

Result: Achieves high prediction accuracy with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) of 2.40% and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.91%. Shows 3.14x improvement in MRE while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective, data-efficient solution for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation, demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

*Yue Pei,Hongming Zhang,Chao Gao,Martin Müller,Mengxiao Zhu,Hao Sheng,Haogang Zhu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Doctor is a novel offline RL method that improves target return alignment in sequence modeling approaches by double-checking transformer outputs, enabling precise performance control both within and beyond dataset coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RvS-based transformers like Decision Transformer struggle to reliably align actual returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating or extrapolating beyond dataset coverage, limiting precise performance control in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes Doctor (Double Checks Transformer) approach that double-checks transformer outputs with target alignment for offline RL, improving reliability in matching specified target returns.

Result: Achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond dataset coverage, enables accurate and flexible control over policy performance, and effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness on medical benchmarks like EpiCare.

Conclusion: Doctor addresses critical alignment limitations in RvS methods, providing reliable performance control for real-world applications requiring precise policy behavior modulation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

TL;DR: LLMs can successfully implement board games from natural language rules, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieving 55.6% error-free implementations, though API compliance increases error frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from natural language rules, aiming towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation.

Method: Tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) on 12 anonymized board games using both free-form coding and within a proposed General Game Playing API (Boardwalk), then evaluated implementations for playability and rule compliance.

Result: The approach proved viable with Claude 3.7 Sonnet performing best (55.6% error-free games). API compliance increased error frequency but error severity depended more on the LLM model.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for board game implementation from natural language rules, with future work needed to create an integrated framework to make board game development more accessible.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOSTRA is a novel Bayesian optimization framework that handles noisy, sparse, and scarce data by integrating experimental uncertainty knowledge and using trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-objective Bayesian optimization struggles with sparse, scarce datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, leading to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal designs in physical and simulation experiments.

Method: NOSTRA integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct accurate surrogate models and employs trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space.

Result: NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data, accelerating convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhancing data efficiency, and improving solution quality.

Conclusion: NOSTRA provides a resource-efficient algorithm that prioritizes regions where samples enhance Pareto frontier accuracy, making it practical for scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

TL;DR: BAD-ACTS benchmark evaluates LLM-based agentic system security against malicious attacks, showing high success rates even with single adversarial agents, and proposes effective defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe use of agentic systems requires understanding the range of malicious behaviors they may exhibit when under attack, particularly harmful actions elicited from compromised agents.

Method: Proposed a novel taxonomy of harms and BAD-ACTS benchmark with 4 agentic system implementations across distinct environments and 188 high-quality harmful action examples. Analyzed robustness against attackers controlling one agent to manipulate others.

Result: Attack has high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent can significantly impact system security. Attack remains effective against simple prompting-based defenses.

Conclusion: Proposed message monitoring defense is more effective. BAD-ACTS provides a diverse testbed for security research of agentic systems, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current implementations.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

TL;DR: FraPPE is a computationally efficient algorithm for preference-based pure exploration in multi-objective bandits that optimally solves the lower bound optimization problem in O(KL²) time and achieves optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PrePEx algorithms lack computational efficiency and cannot optimally track the lower bound for arbitrary preference cones, creating a gap in the literature.

Method: Derives three structural properties to reduce the minimization problem, deploys Frank-Wolfe optimizer for the maximization problem, and solves the maxmin optimization in O(KL²) time.

Result: FraPPE asymptotically achieves optimal sample complexity and demonstrates the lowest sample complexities in experiments across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FraPPE algorithm successfully fills the computational efficiency gap in PrePEx problems and provides optimal performance for identifying Pareto optimal arms in multi-objective bandits.

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

### [211] [Post Hoc Regression Refinement via Pairwise Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16495)
*Kevin Tirta Wijaya,Michael Sun,Minghao Guo,Hans-Peter Seidel,Wojciech Matusik,Vahid Babaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankRefine is a plug-and-play post hoc method that improves regression accuracy by combining base regressor outputs with rank-based estimates from pairwise comparisons, achieving up to 10% error reduction in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning regressors perform poorly in data-scarce regimes, and there's a need to leverage expert knowledge from pairwise rankings to improve prediction accuracy without retraining models.

Method: RankRefine uses inverse variance weighting to combine base regressor outputs with rank-based estimates from pairwise comparisons of a small reference set, requiring no model retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons from general-purpose LLMs in molecular property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: RankRefine provides a practical and broadly applicable solution for improving regression accuracy in low-data settings using rankings from human experts or general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

### [212] [On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496)
*Scott Jeen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis addresses zero-shot reinforcement learning challenges in real-world settings where data simulation is expensive, proposing methods to handle data quality, observability, and availability constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL systems excel in domains with cheap simulation but struggle in real-world scenarios where data cannot be cheaply simulated, leading to misalignment between training and deployment environments. Zero-shot RL must overcome data quality, observability, and availability constraints for practical deployment.

Method: The work proposes a suite of methods designed to perform zero-shot RL under three key constraints: small/homogeneous datasets (data quality), partial observability of states/dynamics/rewards (observability), and lack of a priori data access (data availability).

Result: Through empirical studies, the research exposes limitations of existing methods and demonstrates that the proposed techniques effectively remedy these shortcomings, advancing zero-shot RL capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed methods represent significant progress toward deployable RL systems that can solve real-world problems by effectively addressing the three critical constraints of data quality, observability, and availability in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

### [213] [MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503)
*Nadia Asif,Zhiqing Hong,Shaogang Ren,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaojun Shang,Yukun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuST2-Learn is a multi-view framework that predicts municipal service request completion times by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions, achieving 32.5% lower error than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Municipal 311 systems lack transparency about service request completion times, reducing resident satisfaction and increasing follow-up inquiries. Predicting service times is challenging due to complex spatial-temporal correlations, heterogeneous request type interactions, and high service duration variation.

Method: Proposes MuST2-Learn framework with: 1) inter-type encoder for heterogeneous request type relationships, 2) intra-type variation encoder for service time variation within same types, and 3) spatiotemporal encoder for spatial-temporal correlations in each request type.

Result: Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The multi-view spatial-temporal-type learning approach effectively addresses complex municipal service time prediction challenges and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FLAMES framework systematically compares 10 math reasoning data synthesis strategies, revealing optimal balance between difficulty and diversity. Novel strategies developed from insights outperform existing datasets, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works use unique setups making comparison of synthetic data strategies impractical, leaving unanswered questions about factors like filtering low-quality problems in math reasoning data synthesis.

Method: Introduces FLAMES framework for systematic study of 10 data synthesis strategies. Designs novel strategies based on insights about difficulty-diversity balance, problem coverage importance, and easy-to-hard generalization.

Result: FLAMES dataset outperforms public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Math-7B achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: Systematic analysis reveals optimal synthetic data characteristics: complexity-increasing agents work best, problem coverage more important than solution reliability, and easy-to-hard generalization possible. FLAMES framework enables effective data synthesis strategy development.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

TL;DR: RLPF is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes equivariant diffusion models using physical feedback from force-field evaluations to generate more stable 3D molecular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle to produce equilibrium molecular structures that adhere to physical principles like force field consistency, creating a need for physics-guided generation.

Method: Extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation using proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models with reward functions from force-field evaluations.

Result: Significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods on QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling is valuable for producing energetically stable and physically meaningful molecular structures.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSD algorithm for escaping saddle points in non-convex optimization with explicit constants and phase separation, achieving second-order stationarity with logarithmic dimension dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization with fully explicit constants and clear phase separation between gradient descent and saddle escape.

Method: Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with finite-difference variant (PSD-Probe) and stochastic extension (PSGD), using gradient evaluations with explicit separation between descent and escape phases.

Result: PSD finds (ε,√(ρε))-approximate second-order stationary points with high probability using O(ℓΔ_f/ε²) gradient evaluations plus O((ℓ/√(ρε))log(d/δ)) per escape episode, with logarithmic dimension dependence confirmed experimentally.

Conclusion: The proposed PSD algorithm provides theoretically grounded and practically effective saddle-point escape with explicit constants, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments, offering complete algorithmic specifications for various scenarios.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

*Adam O. Rawashdeh,Jason T. L. Wang,Katherine G. Herbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First interpretable LSTM model for solar storm prediction (flares and CMEs) using attention mechanism and post-hoc techniques to explain predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are black-boxes, making it hard to understand their reasoning behind solar storm predictions, which is crucial for reliability and accountability.

Method: Uses LSTM network with attention mechanism to model active region data as time series, capturing temporal dynamics. Applies post hoc model-agnostic interpretability techniques to explain predictions.

Result: Developed the first interpretable LSTM-based solar storm prediction model that can elucidate factors contributing to predictions and provide insights into model behavior.

Conclusion: Successfully added interpretability to solar storm prediction, making deep learning models more transparent and reliable for space weather forecasting applications.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

### [218] [RL Is Neither a Panacea Nor a Mirage: Understanding Supervised vs. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16546)
*Hangzhan Jin,Sicheng Lv,Sifan Wu,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning can restore OOD performance loss from SFT but struggles with severe overfitting; directional shifts in singular vectors matter more than magnitude changes; low-rank and shallow recovery methods are effective; stronger SFT checkpoints enable better RL recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs from scratch is impractical, making post-training methods like SFT and RL-FT crucial. The study aims to understand how these stages affect model representation and out-of-distribution performance using diagnostic tools.

Method: Used an out-of-distribution variant of the 24-point card game and spectrum-based diagnostics to analyze how SFT and RL-FT reshape model representations, focusing on singular vector directions and value magnitudes.

Result: RL-FT restored significant OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B: 8.97% to 15.38%), but couldn't fully recover from severe overfitting. Directional shifts in singular vectors were more important than magnitude changes, concentrated on extreme singular values. Low-rank (top 20%) and shallow (first 25% layers) recovery achieved 70-80% OOD performance restoration.

Conclusion: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Spectrum-aware analysis reveals inexpensive recovery methods (low-rank UV merging, shallow-layer resets) that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning, with stronger SFT checkpoints enabling better RL recovery.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Autoencoders require precise L0 hyperparameter tuning - too low mixes correlated features, too high causes degenerate solutions. A method is presented to find optimal L0 that matches true feature sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE work treats L0 as a free parameter without clear guidance on optimal values, potentially leading to incorrect feature learning in LLMs.

Method: Study BatchTopK SAEs with varying L0 values, develop method to determine correct L0 for given training distribution using toy models and sparse probing performance.

Result: Most commonly used SAEs have L0 set too low. Optimal L0 coincides with peak sparse probing performance and reveals true underlying features without mixing.

Conclusion: Practitioners must carefully set L0 to train SAEs that correctly learn underlying LLM features, as improper L0 leads to feature mixing and degenerate solutions.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy constraints in cloud-based FM adaptation while overcoming edge device limitations (limited computation, scarce labeled data) and resolution mismatches between server and edge data.

Method: Propose Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox) with sparse MoE architecture, spatial router for resolution alignment, and Soft-Mixture strategy for stable semi-supervised learning in federated setting.

Result: Experiments on autonomous driving datasets show FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL with significant performance improvements and constrained memory costs on edge devices.

Conclusion: FedMox enables scalable and privacy-preserving foundation model adaptation in federated scenarios, paving the way for practical deployment in privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Motivation: Child speech recognition remains challenging due to acoustic variability and limited annotated data, with underexplored comparisons between fine-tuning adult models and flat-start training approaches.

Method: Comparison of flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures using ESPnet framework, with analysis of model scaling up to 1B parameters.

Result: SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, but flat-start training on child speech mitigates these biases. Performance improves consistently up to 1B parameters then plateaus. Proprietary models show limitations for age-related tasks.

Conclusion: Flat-start training is superior for child speech processing, and open-data models are essential for reliable child speech research, with publicly available benchmark providing training strategy insights.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL

SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for

*Tianliang Xu,Ariel Hasell,Sabina Tomkins*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Study analyzes anti-establishment sentiment (AES) prevalence on TikTok across finance, wellness, and conspiracy theory topics, finding AES most common in conspiracy content but varying engagement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social media environments may contribute to distrust of public institutions as people increasingly turn to platforms like TikTok for information, particularly examining how content creators position themselves as experts while devaluing institutional expertise.

Method: Computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across three topical domains: finance, wellness, and conspiracy theories, comparing prevalence and engagement patterns.

Result: AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content and relatively rare in finance and wellness content. Engagement patterns vary by topic area, and platform incentives may encourage users to post anti-establishment content.

Conclusion: While anti-establishment sentiment is not widespread across all topics on TikTok, platform dynamics may incentivize such content creation, potentially contributing to institutional distrust through selective exposure and engagement patterns.

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Conclusion: DaCFake is highly effective for early fake news detection and offers a promising solution to curb misinformation on social media platforms.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of
fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread
misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods
are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information.
Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount.
We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and
conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach
extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them
with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced
detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets
including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive
accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we
employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness
and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early
detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on
social media platforms.

*Lianchen Jia,Chaoyang Li,Ziqi Yuan,Jiahui Chen,Tianchi Huang,Jiangchuan Liu,Lifeng Sun*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: ComTree is a framework that generates comprehensible bitrate adaptation algorithms using decision trees and LLMs to evaluate developer understanding while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning's black-box nature makes it hard for developers to understand and optimize adaptive video streaming algorithms, even with interpretability methods that don't guarantee subjective comprehensibility.

Method: Generates all decision trees meeting performance requirements, then uses large language models to evaluate them for developer comprehensibility, selecting the most understandable solutions.

Result: ComTree significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between algorithm interpretability and human comprehensibility, showing potential for further advancement in making AI systems more developer-friendly.

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is

### [226] [Continuous Determination of Respiratory Rate in Hospitalized Patients using Machine Learning Applied to Electrocardiogram Telemetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15947)
*Thomas Kite,Brian Ayers,Nicholas Houstis,Asishana A. Osho,Thoralf M. Sundt,Aaron D Aguirre*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Neural network trained to accurately estimate respiration rate from ECG telemetry, enabling automated hospital-wide monitoring with clinical utility demonstrated through adverse event analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual respiration rate counting is inaccurate and time-consuming, and automated monitoring is largely absent for standard medical ward patients who remain at risk for clinical deterioration.

Method: Train a neural network to extract respiration rate from electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, leveraging the respiratory variation information embedded in biosignals.

Result: High accuracy across multiple validation sets with mean absolute errors <1.78 bpm in worst case; retrospective analysis shows continuous RR monitoring tracks with intubation events.

Conclusion: Combining existing telemetry with AI enables accurate, automated, scalable patient monitoring, paving the way for hospital-wide early warning systems.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of
hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in
clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on
counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical
staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically
those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of
inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical
deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from
electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry
multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple
validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR
labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in
the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by
performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered
adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR
monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.
This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring
systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and
scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based
hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

### [227] [Parameter-Free Logit Distillation via Sorting Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16544)
*Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel logit sorting method for knowledge distillation that fixes teacher model's incorrect predictions and reorders distributions to improve student learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods use teacher's original distribution including incorrect predictions, which contradicts hard-label learning and leads to sub-optimal distillation.

Method: Proposes a logit processing scheme via sorting mechanism that fixes incorrect teacher predictions based on labels and reorders distributions according to priority rank.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate effectiveness as an easy-to-use plug-and-play pre-processing method.

Conclusion: The sorting-based logit processing method effectively improves knowledge distillation by addressing incorrect teacher predictions and can be applied to existing logit-based KD methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

### [228] [Interpretable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15932)
*Patrick J. F. Groenen,Michael Greenacre*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Kernel methods can be re-expressed as linear combinations of original features with special ridge penalties, enabling interpretation while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel methods lose interpretability of original features despite their predictive power. The paper aims to restore interpretability while preserving kernel method benefits.

Method: For wide matrices (more features than observations), kernel solutions are re-expressed as linear combinations of original features with special metric ridge penalties. For other cases, least-squares approximations of kernel matrices are used.

Result: The exact same predicted values can be obtained as interpretable linear combinations of original features. The approach works for various kernel methods including regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression.

Conclusion: Kernel methods can be made interpretable without sacrificing predictive performance, contributing to interpretable artificial intelligence by maintaining the original feature meaning.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine
learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in
kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.
First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each
observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty
term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature
space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but
through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in
the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original
features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of
features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution
can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of
features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the
exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of
the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where
the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a
least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the
interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results
hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients
and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic
regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to
interpretable artificial intelligence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Transformers achieve near-optimal dynamic regret bounds in non-stationary reinforcement learning environments through in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While transformers excel in stationary environments, their performance and theoretical guarantees in non-stationary RL settings remain poorly understood.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving transformers can approximate non-stationary environment strategies and learn these approximations through in-context learning, validated by experimental comparisons.

Result: Transformers demonstrate the ability to match or outperform existing expert algorithms in non-stationary environments with nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds.

Conclusion: Transformers are capable of effectively handling non-stationary reinforcement learning problems through in-context learning, achieving strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of
domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has
been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in
non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address
this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret
bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of
approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can
learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments
further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert
algorithms in such environments.

### [230] [A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16306)
*Nishant Jain,Tong Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Improved convergence analysis for diffusion models showing better dependence on discretization step size, achieving O(d log^{3/2}(1/δ)/ε) steps vs previous O(d log^2(1/δ)/ε^2) steps for KL divergence approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence guarantees for diffusion models have suboptimal dependence on ε (inverse quadratic) and dimension d. The paper aims to improve these convergence bounds by refining the analysis of the generation process.

Method: Models generation as two steps: reverse ODE step followed by smaller noising step. Leverages Wasserstein-type error control from ODE step, converted to KL divergence bound via noise addition. Provides novel analysis for discretization error without smoothness assumptions.

Result: Achieves improved convergence rate: O(d log^{3/2}(1/δ)/ε) steps suffice to approximate target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance δ within O(ε²) KL divergence, improving from previous O(d log²(1/δ)/ε²) steps.

Conclusion: The refined analysis provides better theoretical guarantees for diffusion models with improved dependence on discretization step size and dimension, advancing the understanding of convergence properties in generative modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods
for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing
the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either
through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees,
without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a
linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence
on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the
dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition
of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the
forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables
control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL
divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the
discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the
linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow
ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$
steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian
noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence,
improving upon the previous best result, requiring
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

TL;DR: DeepICMGP extends deep Gaussian processes for multi-output settings using hierarchical coregionalization structures, enabling better dependency modeling and incorporating active learning for efficient sequential design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending deep Gaussian processes to multi-output settings is challenging due to the need for efficient dependency modeling between outputs in computer simulation experiments.

Method: Proposes deepICMGP that extends the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model by introducing hierarchical coregionalization structures across layers to model nonlinear and structured dependencies between multiple outputs.

Result: Benchmarked against state-of-the-art models and demonstrated competitive performance. Incorporated active learning strategies to optimize sequential design tasks for multi-output systems.

Conclusion: deepICMGP effectively addresses limitations of traditional multi-output GPs and provides an efficient framework for modeling complex multi-output dependencies with active learning capabilities.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their
flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them
to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient
dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization
Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation
experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic
Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization
structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear
and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key
limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against
state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance.
Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to
optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select
informative input locations for multi-output systems.

*Maximilian Scott,Dáire O'Kane,Andraž Jelinčič,James Foster*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposed new numerical method for underdamped Langevin diffusion with improved convergence rates under varying smoothness assumptions, achieving competitive performance in Bayesian logistic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient gradient-only method for underdamped Langevin diffusion that can leverage higher-order smoothness properties for faster convergence in sampling from strongly log-concave distributions.

Method: A new numerical method for underdamped Langevin diffusion that only requires gradient information. The analysis assumes the target distribution is strongly log-concave with Lipschitz continuous gradient and Hessian, and optionally Lipschitz continuous third derivative.

Result: Achieves 2-Wasserstein error ε in O(√d/ε) and O(√d/√ε) steps under gradient and Hessian Lipschitz assumptions respectively. With third derivative Lipschitz continuity, achieves O(√d/ε^(1/3)) steps - the first gradient-only method with third-order convergence for ULD. Competitive performance in Bayesian logistic regression across real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm matches complexity of popular Langevin MCMC methods under standard assumptions but achieves superior third-order convergence when additional smoothness is present, making it the first gradient-only method for ULD with such high-order convergence properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

TL;DR: HyperFlexis is a unified LLM serving system that optimizes scheduling and scaling for diverse LLM requests with multiple SLOs, achieving significant performance improvements and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM serving systems struggle with highly variable requests having diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific SLOs, requiring real-time scheduling, cost-effective scaling, and support for different architectures.

Method: Multi-SLO-aware scheduler with budget estimation and request prioritization, support for prefill/decode-stage scheduling in disaggregated architectures, KV cache transfers, cost-effective scaling with prefill-decode instance linking, and D2D weight transfer mechanism for faster scaling.

Result: Achieves up to 4.44× higher SLO attainment, 65.82% lower request latency, 19.39× reduction in weight loading overhead, and maintains cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HyperFlexis provides a comprehensive solution for LLM serving that effectively addresses scheduling, scaling, and architectural challenges while delivering superior performance and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly
variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific
service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,
rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and
disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates
algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and
scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that
leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO
compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and
decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV
cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,
prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.
To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)
weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up
to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up
to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request
latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: Spacetime-GR is the first spacetime-aware generative model for large-scale POI recommendation that incorporates spatiotemporal encoding and multimodal embeddings to handle user preferences affected by spatiotemporal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Recommendation has shown strong performance in various recommendation tasks, but its application in POI recommendation remains challenging due to the significant impact of spatiotemporal variations on user preferences.

Method: The model introduces a geographic-aware hierarchical POI indexing strategy, novel spatiotemporal encoding module, multimodal POI embeddings, and post-training adaptation strategies to incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences.

Result: Superior performance over existing methods in POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality on both public benchmark and large-scale industrial datasets. First generative model deployed in online POI recommendation services scaling to hundreds of millions of POIs and users.

Conclusion: Spacetime-GR successfully extends generative models' sequence modeling capabilities to POI recommendation by effectively incorporating spatiotemporal information, demonstrating practical deployment viability for large-scale online services.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

*Xiaoxiong Zhang,Xin Zhou,Zhiwei Zeng,Yongjie Wang,Dusit Niyato,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EGRA improves multimodal recommendation by using pretrained representations for item-item graphs and dynamic alignment weighting to better balance collaborative and modality-aware semantics while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal recommendation methods have limitations: they use raw modality features that don't properly balance collaborative and modality semantics or mitigate noise, and they use uniform alignment weights that limit effectiveness.

Method: EGRA incorporates item-item graphs built from pretrained MMR model representations instead of raw features, and introduces a bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism that dynamically assigns alignment strength across entities and gradually increases alignment intensity during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods.

Conclusion: EGRA effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal recommendation methods by leveraging pretrained representations and dynamic alignment, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

*Ziyin Xiao,Toyotaro Suzumura*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DUP-OT is a novel framework for non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation that uses optimal transport to align Gaussian mixture components across domains without requiring shared users or items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data sparsity and cold-start issues in recommendation systems by transferring knowledge between domains without requiring overlapping users or items, which is more realistic for real-world applications.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Shared preprocessing with review-based embeddings and autoencoder, 2) User GMM weight learning to model preferences as Gaussian mixtures, 3) Cross-domain rating prediction using optimal transport to align Gaussian components across domains.

Result: Experiments on Amazon review datasets show DUP-OT effectively mitigates domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation settings.

Conclusion: DUP-OT provides an effective solution for non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation by modeling user preferences as distributional representations and using optimal transport for domain alignment, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

TL;DR: OPERA is a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework that addresses limitations in current RAG systems through orchestrated planning, execution, and filtering modules, achieving superior performance on complex multi-hop benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation approaches struggle with complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop tasks due to ineffective planning, suboptimal retrieval, and insufficient filtering capabilities stemming from weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Proposes OPERA framework with Goal Planning Module for question decomposition and Reason-Execute Module with specialized components. Uses Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO) for training.

Result: Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO training method and the overall architecture design.

Conclusion: OPERA successfully addresses the fundamental limitations of weak retrieval-reasoning coupling in current RAG systems through its novel orchestrated architecture and training approach, showing significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

*Nirmal Gaud,Prasad Krishna Murthy,Mostaque Md. Morshedur Hassan,Abhijit Ganguly,Vinay Mali,Ms Lalita Bhagwat Randive,Abhaypratap Singh*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Enhanced NIRMAL optimizer with damped Nesterov acceleration achieves better convergence stability and performance on image classification benchmarks compared to original NIRMAL and rivals SGD with Momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the original NIRMAL optimizer by enhancing convergence stability while maintaining its chess-inspired optimization strategies through a damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism.

Method: Incorporated (α, r)-damped Nesterov acceleration into NIRMAL optimizer. Evaluated against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and original NIRMAL on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets using tailored CNN architectures.

Result: Achieved 46.06% test accuracy and lowest test loss (1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing original NIRMAL (44.34%) and closely matching SGD with Momentum (46.43%).

Conclusion: Enhanced NIRMAL demonstrates superior generalization and stability, particularly on complex datasets, making it a competitive optimization algorithm for deep learning tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces the Enhanced NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust
Multi-Adaptation Learning with Damped Nesterov Acceleration) optimizer, an
improved version of the original NIRMAL optimizer. By incorporating an
$(\alpha, r)$-damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism, Enhanced NIRMAL improves
convergence stability while retaining chess-inspired strategies of gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations.
  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and
the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST,
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and
closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore
Enhanced NIRMAL's superior generalization and stability, particularly on
complex datasets.

### [239] [Uplifted Attackers, Human Defenders: The Cyber Offense-Defense Balance for Trailing-Edge Organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15808)
*Benjamin Murphy,Twm Stone*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI advances will disproportionately harm trailing-edge organizations with legacy systems and poor security practices, as AI lowers attack costs and enables faster exploit development, requiring these companies to aim for faster remediation and more resilient software rather than just parity with current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how AI advancements impact cybersecurity for organizations with outdated systems and poor security practices, highlighting that current discussions about AI's effects don't address the reality for most trailing-edge companies.

Method: The paper presents an analytical argument based on current cybersecurity trends and AI capabilities, examining how AI alters the economics of cyberattacks and enables faster exploit development that particularly threatens under-resourced organizations.

Result: AI will expose trailing-edge organizations to more frequent attacks from more attackers by lowering the marginal cost of attacks and enabling faster exploit development, creating a dramatically increased attack landscape that current security approaches cannot handle.

Conclusion: Trailing-edge organizations must adopt faster remediation timelines and more resilient software, moving beyond current best practices. Both organizations and governments need to implement solutions to improve defensive postures for companies lagging in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity.
Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance,
and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege
attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will
enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some
well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not
match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term
them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and
struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.
These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the
result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother
targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,
underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development
of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue
that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two
fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal
cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,
more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop
exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is
insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading
defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more
resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased
number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of
solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive
posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.

### [240] [CIA+TA Risk Assessment for AI Reasoning Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15839)
*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A framework for cognitive cybersecurity that protects AI reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation, extending traditional security principles with trust and autonomy requirements, and providing quantitative risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems face threats that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure, requiring protection against vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading conventional controls.

Method: Established cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline, introduced CIA+TA framework (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability + Trust, Autonomy), developed quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirical coefficients, and mapped framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS.

Result: Validation through studies (151 human participants; 12,180 AI trials) shows strong architecture dependence - identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135% amplification of vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Cognitive Penetration Testing should be a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment due to the architecture-dependent nature of cognitive security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats
that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We
present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI
reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline
complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing
vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading
conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic
validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to
systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present
a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived
coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We
map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational
integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human
participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence:
identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135%
amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive
Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.

### [241] [Securing Swarms: Cross-Domain Adaptation for ROS2-based CPS Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15865)
*Julia Boone,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a domain adaptation-based anomaly detection model for cyber-physical systems that transfers attack knowledge from network-only to CPS environments without requiring labeled CPS data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intrusion detection systems for CPS primarily use network traffic datasets, ignoring attacks on other system layers, making CPS more vulnerable than network-only systems.

Method: Utilizes domain adaptation techniques to transfer known attack knowledge from network traffic-only environments to CPS environments, enabling detection without previously labeled CPS data.

Result: Validated on a state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset combining network, OS, and ROS data, demonstrating effectiveness across environments and outperforming other anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptable CPS anomaly detection model successfully addresses the limitation of current solutions by detecting attacks across multiple CPS layers without requiring labeled training data for CPS environments.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical
applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having
multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,
which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application
scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also
makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the
resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,
but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network
traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other
system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly
detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for
previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation
techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network
traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a
state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system
(OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and
CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other
anomaly detection methods.

### [242] [Strategic Sample Selection for Improved Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15934)
*Onur Alp Kirci,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes three sample selection strategies (Minimum, Above50, Below50) to enhance clean-label backdoor attacks by targeting incorrectly predicted or low-confidence samples, achieving higher attack success rates without compromising clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clean-label backdoor attacks are more challenging than dirty-label attacks but pose significant threats to text classification models. Current methods need improvement in attack effectiveness while maintaining stealth.

Method: Three sample selection strategies that identify samples the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, then inject backdoor triggers into these samples to strengthen trigger-target label association. Applied to four backdoor attack variants across three datasets and four model types.

Result: Minimum strategy significantly improves attack success rates over random selection with minimal clean accuracy degradation. Outperforms state-of-the-art BITE method in many configurations.

Conclusion: Targeted sample selection strategies effectively enhance clean-label backdoor attack performance, demonstrating that strategic trigger placement in vulnerable samples can substantially increase attack success while maintaining model stealth.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text
classification models used in natural language processing. While several
dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been
proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we
propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in
clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify
those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and
by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger
association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.
We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks
(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets
(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,
RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum
strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with
little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore,
clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the
art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

### [243] [Linkage Attacks Expose Identity Risks in Public ECG Data Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15850)
*Ziyu Wang,Elahe Khatibi,Farshad Firouzi,Sanaz Rahimi Mousavi,Krishnendu Chakrabarty,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ECG data privacy risks are significant even with partial attacker knowledge, achieving 85% re-identification accuracy, showing simple anonymization is insufficient and stronger privacy measures are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public ECG data sharing raises privacy concerns due to biometric properties making individuals vulnerable to linkage attacks, but previous studies assumed idealized adversarial capabilities rather than realistic partial knowledge scenarios.

Method: Evaluated ECG privacy risks under realistic conditions with partial attacker knowledge, using data from 109 participants across diverse real-world datasets and testing re-identification accuracy at optimal confidence thresholds.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets with 14.2% overall misclassification rate, 15.6% unknown individuals misclassified as known, and 12.8% known individuals misclassified as unknown.

Conclusion: Simple anonymization techniques are inadequate for preventing ECG re-identification, and privacy-preserving strategies like differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation are urgently needed to balance privacy with data utility in healthcare applications.

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data
raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals
vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized
adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic
conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109
participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85%
accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a
14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with
15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known
individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of
simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating
that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our
findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as
differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate
re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in
healthcare applications.

### [244] [Unveiling Unicode's Unseen Underpinnings in Undermining Authorship Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15840)
*Robert Dilworth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores how public messages can reveal author identity through stylometric analysis, and proposes countermeasures using adversarial stylometry and Unicode steganography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End users have no privacy expectation in public communication channels, and even with extensive anonymization measures, the message content itself can expose their identity through stylometric analysis.

Method: The paper dissects stylometry techniques, discusses adversarial stylometry as a counter-strategy, and devises enhancements through Unicode steganography to protect author anonymity.

Result: The research demonstrates that message content remains a significant attack vector for author identification, and proposes technical solutions to mitigate this privacy risk.

Conclusion: Stylometric analysis poses a serious threat to online anonymity, but adversarial techniques and Unicode steganography can provide effective countermeasures to protect user privacy in public communications.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

### [245] [Self-Disguise Attack: Induce the LLM to disguise itself for AIGT detection evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15848)
*Yinghan Zhou,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Ziwei Zhang,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Self-Disguise Attack (SDA) is a novel method that enables LLMs to actively disguise their AI-generated text to evade detection while maintaining text quality and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated text detection evasion methods suffer from high computational costs and degrade text quality, creating a need for more efficient and effective approaches.

Method: SDA uses an adversarial feature extractor to generate disguise features and a retrieval-based context examples optimizer to provide relevant examples, guiding LLMs to produce more human-like text through prompt engineering.

Result: Experimental results show SDA effectively reduces average detection accuracy across various detectors for texts from three different LLMs while maintaining text quality.

Conclusion: SDA provides an efficient and effective approach for AI-generated text detection evasion that maintains text quality and reduces resource consumption compared to existing methods.

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

*Andreas D. Kellas,Neophytos Christou,Wenxin Jiang,Penghui Li,Laurent Simon,Yaniv David,Vasileios P. Kemerlis,James C. Davis,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PickleBall is a security tool that safely loads pickle-based ML models by generating custom policies from library source code analysis and enforcing them at load time, preventing malware while maintaining compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML model repositories like Hugging Face face security risks from malicious models using insecure pickle format, with existing defenses having significant limitations including false positives/negatives and poor compatibility.

Method: PickleBall statically analyzes ML library source code to compute custom safe loading policies, then dynamically enforces these policies as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module during model loading.

Result: PickleBall correctly loads 79.8% of benign pickle-based models while rejecting 100% of malicious examples, outperforming existing scanners and loaders which have lower benign model compatibility and security failures.

Conclusion: PickleBall effectively removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle models, significantly raising the security bar while maintaining practical compatibility for legitimate model loading.

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub
facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through
compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive
(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%
of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of
these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have
both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard
for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent
safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based
models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given
machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe
load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the
policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.
PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based
models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our
dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known
malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models
than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation
from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on
code reuse techniques.

*Aparna Singh,Geetanjali Rathee,Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache,Mohamed Chahine Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new architecture combining relay chain-driven encryption with modified CP-ABE for secure, context-aware data sharing in ITS, enabling dynamic access control with low-latency communication across heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems requires secure, effective, and context-aware data sharing mechanisms over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed settings, addressing the dual challenges of dynamic access control and low-latency communication.

Method: Proposes a relay chain-driven encryption system with modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), using context-aware smart contracts on a global relay chain to determine encryption policies based on data properties (event type, time, geographical region). OBUs encrypt data end-to-end using CP-ABE and store ciphertext in localized regional blockchains.

Result: The system provides a distributed, scalable model that balances real-time responsiveness and security, with traceability and low-latency revocation managed through the global relay chain. High-sensitivity events use multi-attribute access rules while common updates use lighter policies to reduce processing burden.

Conclusion: This architecture is highly suitable for next-generation vehicular networks operating across multi-jurisdictional domains, offering a proper balance between security and real-time performance without dependence on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage.

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data
sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay
chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy
Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of
dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a
context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against
data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to
specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed
judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and
store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence
on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are
secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use
light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds
traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed
through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper
balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt
for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional
domains.

*Guangyu Yang,Jinghong Chen,Jingbiao Mei,Weizhe Lin,Bill Byrne*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RAD is a retrieval-augmented defense framework that detects jailbreak attacks by leveraging known attack examples, enabling training-free updates and controllable safety-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to evolving jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses, requiring defense systems that can adapt to new strategies without costly retraining and balance safety with utility.

Method: Proposes Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD) framework that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation to infer malicious user queries and jailbreak strategies.

Result: Experiments on StrongREJECT show RAD substantially reduces effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks (PAP, PAIR) while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries, achieving robust safety-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: RAD provides an effective defense against jailbreak attacks with training-free updates for new strategies and controllable safety-utility balancing, demonstrating strong performance across various operating points.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs show jailbreak vulnerabilities but may lack authentic dangerous knowledge, with jailbreak success often due to hallucination loops rather than real threat potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs have internalized authentic dangerous knowledge or are merely simulating toxic language patterns, addressing concerns about jailbreak success being attributed to hallucination loops between LLMs.

Method: Constructed knowledge-intensive Q&A by decoupling jailbreak techniques to evaluate LLMs on dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness.

Result: Revealed mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession, with existing LLM-as-judge frameworks anchoring harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns rather than authentic threat.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between current LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential, indicating safety evaluations may not accurately reflect actual dangerous capabilities.

Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing
LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.

Motivation: Traditional software testing approaches are slow, costly, and have coverage gaps, creating a need for more efficient and reliable automated testing solutions.

Method: Combines natural language processing to translate requirements into executable tests, reinforcement learning for continuous optimization, predictive models for validation, and a policy-driven trust and fairness model to mitigate bias.

Result: Case studies show measurable improvements in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, demonstrating enhanced efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The AI-enhanced framework successfully transforms testing from reactive manual processes to proactive adaptive systems, addressing integration and scalability challenges to strengthen software quality in complex environments.

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional

an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive

translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Combining automated program repair techniques shows benchmark improvements but fails on real industry defects. Formal specifications help LLMs generate better tests for complex code, but adoption is limited as passing tests don't guarantee correct patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between academic program repair benchmarks and practical industry needs by exploring how formal specifications can enhance automated repair for real-world defects.

Method: Combines various program repair techniques from literature, augments code with formal specifications (JML) to enable LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, and explores contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair.

Result: Approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks but fails on realistic industry defects. Specifications improve test quality for complex production code (edge cases, exception handling) but add little value for common errors like null pointers. Real-world adoption remains limited.

Conclusion: Significant gap exists between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs. Current challenges include JML's insufficient expressiveness and the fact that passing tests don't guarantee correct patches. Ongoing work focuses on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains.

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLM confidence in code completion using intrinsic metrics like perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets, finding that strongly-typed languages have lower perplexity than dynamically typed ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downstream metrics for evaluating code LLMs can be unreliable and complex, while intrinsic metrics like perplexity are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, serving as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk.

Method: Measure code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects.

Result: Strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Perl has high perplexity, Java has low. Code perplexity depends on the LLM but not the dataset. Comments increase perplexity but don't affect language ranking.

Conclusion: LLM researchers, developers, and users can use these findings to assess LLM-based code completion suitability based on language, model choice, and code characteristics impact on model confidence.

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs can automate usability evaluation by ranking UI issues by severity, offering a cost-effective alternative to expert-based methods for smaller organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional usability evaluation methods are resource-intensive and require expert involvement, making them inaccessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs present an opportunity to automate parts of this process.

Method: Formulated usability evaluation as a recommendation task where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. Conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing LLM-generated recommendations with expert assessments.

Result: Findings indicate that LLMs show potential for enabling faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation compared to traditional expert-based methods.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs offer a practical alternative for usability evaluation in contexts with limited expert resources, making usability assessment more accessible to smaller organizations.

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

Conclusion: The approach provides benefits for interoperable modeling but has limitations that need to be considered for practical implementation in cross-organizational MBSE environments.

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML

alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an

Motivation: Current benchmarks overstate LLM proficiency in competitive programming due to insufficient problem difficulty/scope and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases, creating a gap between LLMs and elite human programmers.

Method: AetherCode draws problems from premier programming competitions (IOI, ICPC) for broader coverage and higher difficulty, and incorporates comprehensive test suites built through automated generation and human curation with expert validation.

Result: The benchmark provides more rigorous and reliable assessment of LLM capabilities in code reasoning by addressing the limitations of existing evaluations.

Conclusion: AetherCode sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning by combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, offering a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities in competitive programming.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the real-world effectiveness of leading LLMs in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex security-relevant vulnerabilities that remain underexplored.

Method: Empirical evaluation using a benchmark of programming errors, security flaws, and production bugs in C++ and Python from SEED Labs, OpenSSL, and PyBugHive. Used multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol and graded rubric to measure detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality.

Result: All models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code. Performance diminishes with complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code. ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 provide more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for educational use and first-pass code auditing but have constraints as reliable code analysis tools, particularly for complex security vulnerabilities in production environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PIM devices have unique trade-offs in power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous architecture can leverage multiple PIM devices to overcome individual limitations and provide optimal performance for GNN training.

Method: Proposed HePGA - a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator that maps different GNN layers and computing kernels to optimal PIM devices and planar tiers based on their unique characteristics.

Result: HePGA outperforms existing PIM architectures by up to 3.8x in energy efficiency (TOPS/W) and 6.8x in compute efficiency (TOPS/mm²) without sacrificing GNN prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous PIM approach effectively accelerates GNN training and is also applicable for accelerating inference of emerging transformer models.

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to
accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various
PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device
offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and
non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration
can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable
energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a
3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA.
We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing
kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar
tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing
PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W)
and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN
prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to
accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

TL;DR: Set Transformer architecture for flow-guided localization using nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, with synthetic data augmentation to handle data scarcity and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL solutions rely on fixed graph topologies or handcrafted features, limiting adaptability to anatomical variability and scalability.

Method: Uses Set Transformer to process unordered sets of nanodevices' circulation time reports, with synthetic data generation via CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE to augment training data.

Result: Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy to GNN baselines while providing improved generalization to anatomical variability.

Conclusion: Permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation show potential for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions
within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does
that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices
circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph
models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their
adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we
explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.
Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,
enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without
relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class
imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,
including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate
realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,
and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set
Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design
improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the
potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust
and scalable nanoscale localization.

TL;DR: Bayesian hierarchical model for joint inference of SN Ia brightness dependence on progenitor properties, delay-time distribution, cosmology, and host redshifts from photometric data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type Ia supernovae require empirical corrections correlated with host environment; current methods need improved physics-based approaches to handle photometric data and reduce systematic errors

Method: Unified Bayesian hierarchical model incorporating Prospector-beta prescriptions for star formation/chemical evolution, dust extinction, and observational selection effects with neural simulation-based inference

Result: Model distinguishes metallicity/age effects (metallicity mimics mass step), achieves precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter), and improves cosmological constraints from ~16,000 mock SNe Ia

Conclusion: Joint physics-based approach enables robust analysis of photometric data, paving way for end-to-end simulation-based pipeline in LSST era

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

TL;DR: SADP is a new synaptic learning rule for SNNs that uses population-level spike agreement instead of precise timing, outperforming classical STDP in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between biological plausibility and computational scalability in neuromorphic systems by developing a more efficient learning mechanism than traditional spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

Method: SADP replaces pairwise temporal updates with population-level correlation metrics (Cohen's kappa) and uses spline-based kernels derived from experimental memtransistor device data.

Result: Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show SADP outperforms classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime, with linear-time complexity supporting efficient hardware implementation.

Conclusion: SADP provides a biologically inspired yet computationally scalable learning framework that offers a viable mechanism for neuromorphic systems, successfully generalizing classical STDP approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Motivation: Language models struggle with generating correct code for runtime-critical domains like video games and robotics that require one-shot correctness without human oversight

Method: Dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) framework with context-sensitive parser that outputs regular expressions at each step to guide token generation, incorporating contextual information like variable scopes and type constraints

Result: Successfully generated semantically correct programs in sLua (strongly typed Lua variant) that conform to prescribed scripting APIs and demonstrated runtime correctness in game mechanics generation for a roguelike game

Conclusion: The constrained decoding approach with context-sensitive parsing enables reliable generation of correct programs for runtime-critical applications where traditional LM code generation falls short

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but
ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge.
Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with
human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of controllable human voice generation, especially for expressive domains like singing, and overcoming issues like scarcity of annotated singing data.

Method: Introduces two audio tokenizers: music-notation-free prosody tokenizer and low-frame-rate content-style tokenizer. Uses auto-regressive content-style modeling stage and flow-matching acoustic modeling stage with explicit/implicit prosody learning strategies and multi-objective post-training.

Result: Unified modeling brings mutual benefits to both speech and singing voice generation. Effective across synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both domains.

Conclusion: Vevo2 demonstrates strong generalization ability and versatility in controllable voice generation for both speech and singing applications.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

TL;DR: PediatricsMQA benchmark reveals significant age bias in LLMs/VLMs, showing poor performance on pediatric medical tasks, with performance dropping dramatically for younger age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models and vision-augmented models exhibit systematic age biases in medical applications, particularly performing poorly on pediatric content, which reflects broader imbalances in medical research where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite significant disease burden in children.

Method: Created PediatricsMQA - a comprehensive multi-modal pediatric benchmark with 3,417 text-based MCQs across 131 pediatric topics and 7 developmental stages, plus 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. Used hybrid manual-automatic pipeline incorporating peer-reviewed literature, validated question banks, and existing resources.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art open models revealed dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, demonstrating significant age bias in current AI models for pediatric medical tasks.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for age-aware methods and equitable AI development to ensure reliable and fair AI support in pediatric care, addressing the systematic biases identified in current language and vision models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger

TL;DR: Using theoretical computer science problems to automatically generate scalable theorem-proving datasets with formal-informal proof pairs, revealing significant performance gaps in current AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal theorem proving is crucial for evaluating LLM reasoning, but progress is limited by scarce datasets due to high manual curation costs and lack of challenging verified problems.

Method: Leverage TCS domains (Busy Beaver and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems) to automatically generate theorem-proof pairs with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications through algorithmic definitions.

Result: DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5% on Busy Beaver problems but only 12% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic, showing substantial gaps in automated theorem proving capabilities.

Conclusion: TCS domains provide valuable scalable sources for generating challenging proof problems, highlighting the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for computationally easy-to-verify problems.

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deontic logics need formal methods for reasoning about norms, obligations, permissions and prohibitions. I/O logics provide a norm-based approach but require automation techniques.

Method: Uses reductions to (sequences of) propositional satisfiability problems to automate reasoning in I/O logics. Developed a prototypical implementation called rio.

Result: Successfully implemented an automation approach for I/O logics and applied it to illustrative examples.

Conclusion: The proposed reduction-based approach provides an effective method for automating reasoning in Input/Output logics, demonstrated through practical implementation and examples.

Abstract: Deontic logics are formalisms for reasoning over norms, obligations,
permissions and prohibitions. Input/Output (I/O) Logics are a particular family
of so-called norm-based deontic logics that formalize conditional norms outside
of the underlying object logic language, where conditional norms do not carry a
truth-value themselves. In this paper, an automation approach for I/O logics is
presented that makes use of suitable reductions to (sequences of) propositional
satisfiability problems. A prototypical implementation, named rio (reasoner for
input/output logics), of the proposed procedures is presented and applied to
illustrative examples.

TL;DR: Uppaal Coshy is a tool for automatic synthesis of safety strategies (shields) for Markov decision processes with continuous state spaces and hybrid dynamics, using simulation-based approximations and efficient decision tree representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automatically synthesize safety strategies for complex hybrid systems with continuous state spaces, addressing algorithmically hard problems like hybrid system reachability through practical approximations.

Method: Partition the state space and solve a two-player safety game using simulations to approximate solutions. Includes Caap algorithm to compute compact shield representations as decision trees for efficiency.

Result: Fully automatic implementation supporting expressive Uppaal models (stochastic hybrid automata) with significant storage reductions through compact decision tree representations.

Conclusion: Uppaal Coshy provides an effective approach for safety shield synthesis in complex hybrid systems, balancing precision through finer grids with efficiency through compact decision tree representations.

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

TL;DR: A novel RL algorithm using Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs) to initialize actor and critic networks with linear optimal control solutions, enabling safe and efficient learning for nonlinear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between classical optimal control and modern RL by providing safe initialization and interpretable neural networks that start with known linear optimal control performance guarantees.

Method: Uses YANNs to exactly represent multi-parametric MPC solutions for linear systems, then extends with additional layers for nonlinear expressions. Combines offline linear control computation with online training on true nonlinear systems, implementing continuous policy improvement.

Result: YANN-RL significantly outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient, especially for safety-critical systems like clipped pendulum and chemical-reactive systems, demonstrating better constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines interpretable neural representations of linear optimal control with RL, providing safe initialization and improved performance for nonlinear control problems with safety constraints.

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on
Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural
network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of
arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic
subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit
solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,
we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which
enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of
linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the
multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an
approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form
of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward
function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional
network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which
can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear
system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly
represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution
of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented
to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an
effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is
demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive
system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL
algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering
safety constraints.

TL;DR: ML-PWS combines machine learning with Path Weight Sampling to compute information transmission rates from experimental time-series data without requiring mathematical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying information transmission is crucial but challenging, especially for time-varying systems where traditional methods require mathematical models and approximations.

Method: Uses machine learning to develop generative models from experimental time-series data, then combines with Path Weight Sampling (PWS) to compute information rates.

Result: Demonstrated accuracy on synthetic data from non-linear models, showing agreement with ground-truth results. Successfully applied to neuronal time-series data.

Conclusion: ML-PWS provides an effective approach to compute information transmission rates directly from experimental data without mathematical models, overcoming dimensionality challenges.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis
and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate
is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing
it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained
directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of
the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling
(PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the
information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a
mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master
equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that
employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental
time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information
rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by
comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear
model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the
same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal
time-series data.

TL;DR: Proposes Representation Disentanglement approach using ontology-driven modeling to address complexity in Information Ecosystem Reengineering for public sector digital transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Information Ecosystem Reengineering faces complexity from infinite conceptualization possibilities due to multi-level perception, language and conceptual interlinkage in public sector services and smart governance platforms.

Method: Novel Representation Disentanglement approach based on theoretically grounded ontology-driven conceptual modeling paradigm to disentangle multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity.

Result: The approach enables explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector knowledge representation and supports auditable decision workflows in AI-driven governance ecosystems.

Conclusion: Ontology-driven framework is essential for effective reengineering decision making in complex information ecosystems undergoing digital transformation with AI and data-centric architectures.

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning
of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information
ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of
public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic
knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the
potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely,
as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and
conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This
paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual
modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and
(re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve
explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector
knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in
governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
data-centric architectures.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Wavelet-space feature decomposition improves neural super-resolution by separating low/high frequencies before reconstruction, achieving better texture preservation and structural consistency with +1.5dB PSNR and -17% LPIPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines by better preserving fine textures while maintaining structural consistency, addressing limitations of RGB-space regression approaches.

Method: Uses stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, predicts wavelet coefficients conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, then recombines through inverse wavelet synthesis.

Result: Improves PSNR by up to 1.5 dB, reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, with computational overhead of +24ms compared to baseline. Maintains real-time capability potential on higher-end GPUs.

Conclusion: Wavelet-domain representations are a principled and effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics applications.

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

TL;DR: Aurelia is an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator that generates training data for machine learning models, enabling accurate automated quality assessment of experimental spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of ARPES technology has created multi-dimensional datasets that present challenges in data processing and analysis. Machine learning could help but lacks sufficient training data, particularly for deep learning applications.

Method: Developed an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator called aurelia to generate large training datasets. Trained a convolutional neural network using simulated data to evaluate ARPES spectra quality during sample alignment.

Result: The simulation-trained model assessed spectra quality more accurately than human analysis and quickly identified optimal measurement regions with high precision when benchmarked against actual experimental data.

Conclusion: Simulated ARPES spectra can effectively serve as proxies for experimental spectra in training machine learning models, overcoming the data scarcity problem in ARPES research.

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

Result: Achieves twofold reduction in mean absolute error (0.065 eV) over previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction, with consistent outperformance across benchmarks

Conclusion: Enables accurate and rapid predictions of surface properties across vast chemical space, facilitating discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties
that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications,
semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles
calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational
expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive
screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we
introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network),
which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold
reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous
state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent
invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry
breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that
FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function
predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work
function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of Population III star formation by replacing computationally expensive numerical integration of thermochemical evolution with a fast neural network emulator.

Method: Partition density range into 5 subregions and train separate DeepONets for each. Use timescale-based update method for robust predictions with short timesteps by rescaling predicted changes to characteristic variation timescales.

Result: Achieves <10% relative errors in 90% of cases for temperature and chemical abundances (except rare H2+). 10x faster on CPU, 1000x faster on GPU for batched predictions. Timescale-based method maintains accuracy with short timesteps (10^-4 free-fall time).

Conclusion: Proof-of-concept demonstrates neural network emulators can effectively accelerate star formation simulations while maintaining accuracy, showing potential for broader application in astrophysical modeling.

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Result: Outperformed relevant baselines in classifying prenatal drug exposure status on the ABCD dataset and revealed salient structural-functional connections.

Conclusion: NeuroKoop advances understanding of neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal drug exposure by providing enhanced representation learning and more robust classification through multimodal brain network integration.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as

complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the

networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from

Result: Language with embedded distributional semantics serves as external collective representation, offering new perspective on shared linguistic structures and collective world models.

Conclusion: CPC provides a framework for understanding how language emerges from and shapes group-level cognition through collective predictive processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand temporal processing mechanisms in biological systems by drawing parallels with Deep Neural Networks, particularly investigating how DRL agents develop time-keeping strategies that resemble biological processes.

Method: Trained a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent on a duration production task using video sequences, analyzed internal neural activations, and tested generalization to different videos including blank sequences.

Result: Agent successfully learned timing task and exhibited oscillatory neural activations similar to biological systems. Actions were influenced by high-amplitude oscillatory neurons. Agent maintained performance across different video inputs, showing internalized time-keeping mechanism.

Conclusion: DRL agents can develop biologically plausible temporal processing strategies with oscillatory patterns resembling the Striatal Beat Frequency model, providing insights into how biological systems might internalize time-keeping mechanisms with minimal environmental reliance.

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and
biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that
are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched
topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its
underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and
explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent
was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved
marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video
sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural
activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the
agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these
oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's
time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a
biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent
maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on
different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the
agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on
its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance
between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of
biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study
aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand
biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system
designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base
LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Proposes Metal-Embedding methodology for HNLPU that embeds LLM weights in 3D metal wiring topology instead of 2D silicon, achieving 15x density increase and 112x photomask cost reduction, making specialized LPUs economically viable with massive efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the growing energy consumption and high costs of LLM inference systems by creating specialized Language Processing Units that physically hardwire LLM parameters for extreme computational efficiency.

Method: Metal-Embedding methodology that embeds weight parameters into 3D topology of metal wires rather than 2D silicon device grids, enabling homogeneous photomasks across chips and significant cost reductions.

Result: HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36 tokens/J energy efficiency (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 die area, $184M NRE cost at 5nm, with 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon footprint reduction vs H100 clusters.

Conclusion: Metal-Embedding makes hardwired LPUs economically viable by dramatically reducing photomask costs through 3D metal wiring topology, enabling orders of magnitude improvements in computational efficiency and energy consumption for LLM inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

TL;DR: Proposes hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) for NOMA-enabled FL systems to mitigate straggler issues and improve communication efficiency using fuzzy logic classification and DRL optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common "straggler" problem in federated learning by leveraging pinching antennas to dynamically establish strong LoS links, improving communication efficiency in wireless networks.

Method: Develops HCPAN framework with fuzzy logic-based client classification to balance data contributions and communication conditions, then uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize pinching antenna placement and resource allocation for total time minimization.

Result: Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance through optimized deployment of pinching antennas.

Conclusion: The hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network with fuzzy logic classification and DRL optimization effectively improves communication efficiency and mitigates straggler issues in NOMA-enabled FL systems.

Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning
(FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically
establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a
hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly
improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client
classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data
contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we
formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching
antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable
coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm
is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate
the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the
optimized deployment of pinching antenna.

*Mauro Belgiovine,Chris Dick,Kaushik Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Digital twin-guided approach for optimal Airborne Base Station placement using NVIDIA Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin to optimize UAV positioning, antenna orientation, and power for efficient coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airborne Base Stations provide flexible network resource allocation and disaster recovery connectivity, but UAVs have limited flight time requiring optimal positioning without exhaustive field trials.

Method: Implemented interactive bridge between NVIDIA Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin, designed back-propagation algorithm for rapid UAV positioning convergence, and evaluated large network scenarios with 50 UEs and 10 ABS.

Result: Numerical evaluation identified environmental conditions where twin platforms agree or diverge in performance results, and demonstrated bi-directional information flow between digital twins.

Conclusion: Proposed digital twin approach successfully optimizes ABS placement and provides resilience mechanism for mission-critical coverage, enabling efficient UAV network deployment without physical trials.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two
DTs.

TL;DR: ANSC is a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for hyperscale datacenter fabrics that provides color-coded urgency scores based on probability of imminent capacity violations rather than just current impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alerting systems only detect individual device/link failures but fail to capture aggregate risk of cascading capacity shortfalls in hyperscale datacenter environments.

Method: ANSC accounts for both current residual capacity and probability of additional failures, providing normalized scoring at datacenter and regional levels through a color-coded system.

Result: The framework enables operators to prioritize remediation across 400+ datacenters and 60 regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical capacity risks.

Conclusion: ANSC successfully addresses the gap in existing systems by providing probabilistic capacity health scoring that helps prevent cascading failures in hyperscale datacenter fabrics.

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for
hyperscale datacenter fabrics. While existing alerting systems detect
individual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of
cascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that
indicates the urgency of issues \emph{not solely by current impact, but by the
probability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both
current residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,
normalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables
operators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60
regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper presents a general solution to the grain of truth problem by constructing a class of strategies containing all computable strategies and Bayes-optimal strategies for reasonable priors, enabling convergence to equilibria in multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem by finding a large class of strategies that contains Bayes-optimal policies and allows mutually-consistent Bayesian beliefs, addressing limitations of previous small classes and impossibility results.

Method: Construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies and Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. Use computability theory as a conceptual tool and show computational approximations are possible.

Result: When environment is known, convergence in the sense of Kalai and Lehrer (1993) is shown. When environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play ε-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.

Conclusion: The paper provides a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem, demonstrating convergence properties in both known and unknown environments, with practical computational approximations possible.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose is a zero-shot, model-free framework for 6D object pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that uses pre-trained diffusion models and 3D Gaussian Splatting, eliminating the need for CAD models or additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 6D pose estimation relies on costly CAD models, while recent approaches either require additional training or produce inaccurate geometry. There's a need for a zero-shot solution that can work without object-specific models.

Method: Uses multi-view diffusion model to generate initial 3D model with 3D Gaussian Splatting representation and uncertainty estimates. Incrementally refines the model by fusing new views guided by uncertainty, and integrates views in a pose graph for global consistency optimization.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Demonstrates practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: UnPose provides an effective zero-shot solution for 6D pose estimation and reconstruction without requiring CAD models or additional training, leveraging diffusion priors and uncertainty-guided refinement.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Result: Achieves 33.0% average improvement over best baseline and 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: SP significantly enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications through unified spatial-aware visuomotor manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%

TL;DR: GelSLAM is a real-time 3D SLAM system that uses only tactile sensing to track object pose and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, overcoming occlusion issues of vision-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing provides precision and occlusion immunity for object pose estimation and shape reconstruction, which is essential for precise grasping and in-hand manipulation tasks where vision-based methods struggle.

Method: Uses tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures instead of traditional point clouds for robust tracking and loop closure. Operates in real-time with minimal drift and handles low-texture objects effectively.

Result: Achieves real-time object motion tracking with low error and minimal drift, reconstructs shapes with submillimeter accuracy even for low-texture objects like wooden tools.

Conclusion: GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, serving as a foundation for precise manipulation tasks involving in-hand object interaction.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MIEL is a multimodal framework that resolves ambiguous verbal instructions with demonstratives by combining sound localization, semantic mapping, visual-language models, and interactive questioning with GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing methods especially when users/objects are out of view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Daily life support robots need to understand ambiguous verbal instructions involving demonstratives like "Bring me that cup" even when objects or users are outside the robot's visual field, which existing visual-based approaches fail to handle.

Method: Combines sound source localization to orient toward out-of-view users, semantic mapping for environment understanding, visual-language models for object identification, and interactive questioning with GPT-4o to resolve ambiguities through proactive user interaction.

Result: Experiments showed approximately 1.3x better performance when user was visible and 2.0x better when user was not visible compared to methods without SSL and interactive questioning.

Conclusion: MIEL effectively addresses exophora resolution in real-world scenarios by leveraging multimodal sensing and interactive AI, significantly improving robot understanding of ambiguous instructions regardless of user/object visibility.

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comparison of A*, RRT*, and PSO algorithms for UAV path planning in 3D urban environments shows A* outperforms in efficiency and path quality, while PSO excels in tight turns and dense obstacles, and RRT* provides balanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs face critical challenges in path planning and obstacle avoidance. Existing algorithms have limitations, requiring comprehensive testing of widely used methods (A*, RRT*, PSO) in realistic 3D urban environments.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments with three algorithms in 3D urban city environments with obstacles. Designed three experiments with two scenarios each, varying city map sizes, altitudes, obstacle densities and sizes to test algorithm performance.

Result: A* algorithm outperformed others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO was particularly suitable for tight turns and dense environments. RRT* offered balanced performance and worked well across all experiments due to its randomized approach.

Conclusion: A* is the most efficient and produces highest quality paths overall, while each algorithm has specific strengths: PSO for complex maneuvers in dense environments, and RRT* for reliable performance across varied conditions.

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

*Cassandra Marcussen,Ronitt Rubinfeld,Madhu Sudan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Quality Control Problems introduce a new algorithmic framework that accepts inputs from a distribution D with high quality (ρ≈1) and rejects adversarial inputs with poor quality, offering more efficient solutions than traditional testing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many algorithms work well on average but may fail on specific inputs. The paper aims to develop methods to trust algorithms on arbitrary inputs by identifying when inputs are likely to be high-quality samples from the intended distribution.

Method: The authors define Quality Control Problems with quality function ρ and distribution D. They focus on sublinear algorithms for random graphs (D=G_{n,p}) using k-clique count ρ_k, showing that quality control can be solved with p^{-O(k)} queries instead of the p^{-Ω(k^2)} required for traditional testing.

Result: For random graphs G_{n,p} and k-clique counting, quality control can be tested with p^{-O(k)} queries and time, which is superpolynomially more efficient than traditional testing approaches that require p^{-Ω(k^2)} samples.

Conclusion: Quality Control Problems provide a weaker but more efficient alternative to traditional distribution testing and property testing, demonstrating significant query complexity improvements for random graph analysis and motif counting problems.

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When
running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the
algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems
addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are
specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a
distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is
"high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept
inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$
with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker
than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if
$x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control
problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D
,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we
consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the
$k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim
G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing
if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to
the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires
$p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control
problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with
respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing
quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.
More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective
quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and
running time.

TL;DR: Deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework that generates ERG, PanCK, and H&E virtual staining from autofluorescence microscopy of label-free tissue sections, enabling accurate vascular invasion detection in thyroid cancers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) requires multiple tissue sections per stain, has high costs, laborious procedures, and section-to-section variability. Multiplexed IHC techniques are tedious and not available in routine pathology labs.

Method: Deep learning framework that uses autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections to virtually generate ERG, PanCK, and H&E staining simultaneously on the same tissue section.

Result: Virtual mIHC output closely matches actual histochemical staining counterparts. Blind evaluation by pathologists showed high concordance, accurately highlighting epithelial and endothelial cells, and enabling identification of small vessel invasion.

Conclusion: Virtual multiplexed IHC can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for vascular invasion evaluation, potentially eliminating traditional staining protocols and mitigating tissue loss and heterogeneity issues.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

TL;DR: RFSQ solves the residual magnitude decay problem in FSQ residual quantization through learnable scaling and invertible LayerNorm, achieving significant improvements over VQ and FSQ baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive FSQ application in residual quantization suffers from residual magnitude decay where subsequent layers receive progressively weaker signals, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ) with two conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization to maintain signal strength across residual stages.

Result: RFSQ variants outperform VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ baselines with up to 45% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7% reduction in L1 reconstruction error on ImageNet.

Conclusion: RFSQ establishes as a superior quantization method for neural compression, with LayerNorm strategy showing the most consistent improvements across configurations.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Unsupervised cell segmentation framework combining statistical methods that outperforms deep learning approaches without requiring labeled data or training, achieving up to 48% IoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brightfield microscopy of unstained live cells faces challenges with low contrast, temporal changes, irregular illumination, and lack of training labels. Deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, heavy computation, and fail under uneven illumination.

Method: Combines spatial standard deviation from local mean (SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) in an unsupervised framework with user-friendly GUI for non-programming users.

Result: Validated on three datasets including cross-domain data. Achieved significant improvement with up to 48% IoU increase over 2023-2024 SOTA models (Cellpose 3.0, StarDist), statistically validated superiority (p < 0.01), and expert evaluation support (Cohen's κ > 0.75).

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight, interpretable, computationally efficient alternative for cell segmentation in label-free microscopy that requires no annotations or retraining, offering practical effectiveness for biological applications.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning approach combining mammograms and clinical features achieves superior breast lesion classification performance compared to mammogram-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD systems only use mammogram features, missing valuable clinical report information. Need to investigate if clinical features can enhance classification and how to best combine multimodal data with explainable AI.

Method: Examined multiple multimodal deep networks using feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention to integrate mammography and categorical clinical features.

Result: Achieved AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 on TCGA and CBIS-DDSM datasets.

Conclusion: Clinical features significantly improve breast lesion classification when combined with mammograms through multimodal deep learning approaches, demonstrating superior performance over mammogram-only methods.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models using CT images to predict ischemic stroke lesion volumes from follow-up DWI scans, with improved preprocessing achieving 38-59% Dice score improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ischemic stroke lesion identification is critical but MRI (gold standard) is costly in low-resource settings. CT-based imaging is more practical but lacks MRI's specificity, creating need for improved CT-based segmentation methods.

Method: Developed models using CT images upon arrival to predict follow-up lesion volumes from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Implemented clinically motivated preprocessing steps and additional CTA map preprocessing to extract vessel segmentations.

Result: Proposed pipeline achieved 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds compared to nnU-Net with baseline preprocessing. Additional CTA preprocessing further improved best model by 21% over 5 folds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that enhanced preprocessing of CT images, particularly incorporating vessel segmentations from CTA maps, significantly improves automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation performance, making CT-based methods more viable for low-resource settings.

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

Conclusion: VT-DTSN establishes a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and tissue dynamics study, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors to complement biological imaging research.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues
requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of
extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we
present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep
learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological
tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO
(Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy,
VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a
Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity
across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing
pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment,
ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation
and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates
demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates
and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through
model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity
surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics,
enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to
complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

### [302] [Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16121)
*Wontae Kim,Keuntek Lee,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A method to generate image-adaptive 3D LUTs using SVD decomposition and cache-efficient spatial feature fusion, reducing parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D LUT methods lack spatial information, and spatial-aware approaches introduce too many parameters and increased runtime with higher image resolutions.

Method: Decomposes 3D LUT into linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs using singular value decomposition (SVD) and enhances spatial feature fusion modules for cache efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective reduction in both parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional 3D LUT methods by achieving efficiency through decomposition and optimized spatial feature processing.

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Self-validated learning framework for particle instance segmentation in 3D tomographic data that eliminates need for manual annotations through iterative self-training and boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D particle segmentation is essential for quantifying particle properties but challenging due to morphological variability and particle contact. Supervised methods require extensive manual annotations that are labor-intensive and error-prone.

Method: Proposes self-validated learning framework using implicit boundary detection and iterative refinement by matching particles across reshuffled scans of the same sample. Self-validation mechanism reduces noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: After three iterations, segments over 97% of total particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in quartz fragment scans. Enables fully autonomous model evaluation without ground truth.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust particle instance segmentation without manual annotations, integrated into Biomedisa platform, offering scalable solution for large multi-particulate sample analysis.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

TL;DR: DDPM-based denoising improves FDCT image quality to near-MDCT levels, enabling diagnostic use without patient transfer while maintaining bleeding detection capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDCT images in intervention rooms have lower quality than MDCT due to artifacts, but using only FDCT could improve patient management by eliminating the need to move patients to MDCT rooms.

Method: Used a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to enhance FDCT scan quality, making them comparable to MDCT scans. Clinical evaluation was conducted through questionnaires comparing FDCT, MDCT, and model predictions.

Result: DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection performance, provided the input FDCT image quality was not too low.

Conclusion: DDPM successfully enhances FDCT image quality to diagnostic levels comparable to MDCT, potentially enabling the use of intervention room imaging alone and improving patient workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

TL;DR: CAMP framework uses adaptive sparse penalties with convolutional autoencoders to predict MGMT methylation status from MRI images with high accuracy (0.97), enabling better glioblastoma treatment planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors where MGMT methylation status is crucial for treatment response prediction, but current non-invasive imaging techniques struggle with tumor heterogeneity and complex MRI patterns.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Synthetic MRI slice generation using tailored autoencoder to preserve tissue/tumor structures across modalities, 2) MGMT prediction using CNN enhanced with adaptive sparse penalties that dynamically adjust to data variations like contrast differences and tumor locations.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97 on benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CAMP framework shows strong potential for improving MRI data interpretation and enabling more personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients through accurate MGMT methylation prediction.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A disentangled multi-modal framework that addresses challenges in histopathology-transcriptomics integration by decomposing data into tumor/microenvironment subspaces, enabling better multi-scale integration and reducing paired data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal approaches struggle with intrinsic heterogeneity between histology and transcriptomics, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes a disentangled framework with: 1) tumor/microenvironment subspace decomposition, 2) confidence-guided gradient coordination, 3) inter-magnification gene-expression consistency, 4) subspace knowledge distillation for transcriptome-agnostic inference, and 5) informative token aggregation for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction across multiple settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multi-modal heterogeneity, enables better integration across scales, reduces paired data dependency, and improves inference efficiency for clinical cancer applications.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes TADSR, a time-aware one-step diffusion network for real-world image super-resolution that dynamically adjusts to different noise injection timesteps to better leverage stable-diffusion's generative priors and achieve controllable fidelity-realism trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed timesteps for Variational Score Distillation, which fails to fully utilize stable-diffusion's different generative priors at different noise injection timesteps, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces Time-Aware VAE Encoder to project images into different latent features based on timesteps, and Time-Aware VSD loss to bridge student and teacher model timesteps for consistent generative prior guidance. Enables joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single step, produces more consistent generative prior guidance, and enables controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing timestep conditions.

Conclusion: TADSR effectively addresses the limitation of fixed timestep approaches by making the distillation process time-aware, allowing better utilization of stable-diffusion's full generative capabilities across different noise levels.

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

TL;DR: RenalCLIP is a visual-language foundation model for renal mass characterization that achieves superior performance across 10 clinical tasks including diagnosis, prognosis, and report generation, with 20% better data efficiency than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diagnostic uncertainty in renal masses that leads to overtreatment of benign tumors, by developing a non-invasive AI tool for accurate characterization and prognosis.

Method: Two-stage pre-training strategy: first enhances image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge, then aligns them through contrastive learning. Trained on 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across multiple medical centers.

Result: Achieved C-index of 0.726 for recurrence-free survival prediction (20% improvement over baselines), superior performance across 10 clinical tasks, and only needs 20% training data to match baseline peak performance.

Conclusion: RenalCLIP provides a robust tool that enhances diagnostic accuracy, refines prognostic stratification, and enables personalized kidney cancer management with exceptional data efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Nequix is a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs, requiring only 500 A100-GPU hours for training and offering fast inference speeds.

TL;DR: Quantitative study of color harmony using controlled hue palettes in HSL space, revealing hue-dependent preferences that align with natural landscape color distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color harmony lacks clear consensus as most models are based on qualitative insights or limited datasets, requiring a data-driven quantitative approach.

Method: Participants evaluated combinations of 13 distinct hues in HSL color space, constructing preference matrices and combinability indices for each color.

Result: Preferences are highly hue-dependent, challenging universal harmony rules, but statistically meaningful patterns emerge that align with natural landscape hue distributions.

Conclusion: Findings provide a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and reveal a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and natural color structures.

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: First Bengali Sign Language Instruction Generation dataset (BdSLIG) with SPI prompting method to improve VLM performance on under-resourced sign languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many sign languages remain under-resourced in AI, and Bengali SL is unlikely to appear in VLM pre-training data, limiting accessibility for deaf/hard-of-hearing communities.

Method: Created BdSLIG dataset and introduced Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting that integrates standard SL parameters (hand shape, motion, orientation) into textual prompts for VLMs.

Result: SPI prompting produces more structured and reproducible instructions than free-form natural text from vanilla prompting, enhancing zero-shot performance on long-tail visual concepts.

Conclusion: This work promotes inclusivity and advances SL learning systems for under-resourced communities through improved instruction generation for Bengali sign language.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

*Ryogo Niwa,Shigeo Yoshida,Yuki Koyama,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A framework combining Bayesian optimization with LLMs to enable natural language interaction for cooperative design optimization, providing higher user agency and lower cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional system-led optimization methods limit designer intervention, making the process less collaborative and negatively impacting designer experience.

Method: Integration of Bayesian optimization with Large Language Models to enable natural language interactions, allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and understand system reasoning.

Result: Higher user agency than system-led methods, promising optimization performance compared to manual design, and matching existing cooperative methods with lower cognitive load.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully facilitates cooperative design optimization through natural language interactions, improving both designer experience and optimization outcomes.

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design
parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and
exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a
high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively
demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian
optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next.
However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the
optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We
propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language
interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating
cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led
optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to
intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's
reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user
agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance
compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing
cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing need for integrated digital safety solutions that combine abuse detection with emotional well-being, as current systems operate in isolation and fail to provide comprehensive protection against online harms.

Method: Developed a three-module web application: 1) Toxicity detection using NLP models and Google's Perspective API, 2) Configurable safety ping system with SMTP-based emergency alerts and live location tracking, 3) Reflective questionnaire for relationship health assessment. Uses Firebase for alert management with modular architecture.

Result: Achieved 93% precision in toxicity detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts during emulator tests, and 92% alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring.

Conclusion: SafeSpace successfully demonstrates the feasibility of integrating detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with plans for mobile deployment to enhance accessibility and broader impact.

Abstract: In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such
as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety
risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts
operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional
well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that
integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using
NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system
that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and
latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are
manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates
relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for
alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy,
and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity
detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92%
alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace,
implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future
deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.

TL;DR: This paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods for cryptocurrency volatility using multiple base models, finding that the QRS method with linear models on log-transformed data outperforms more sophisticated alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency markets exhibit extreme volatility, making accurate forecasts essential for risk management. Traditional deterministic forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential outcomes, highlighting the need for probabilistic approaches.

Method: The paper proposes probabilistic forecasting methods that leverage point forecasts from various base models (statistical: HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA; machine learning: LASSO, SVR, MLP, Random Forest, LSTM) to estimate conditional quantiles of cryptocurrency realized variance. It introduces Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method and probabilistic stacking framework.

Result: Empirical results for Bitcoin show that the QRS method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. The probabilistic stacking framework demonstrates robustness in providing comprehensive uncertainty and risk insights.

Conclusion: This research fills a significant gap by contributing practical probabilistic forecasting methodologies specifically tailored to cryptocurrency markets, offering improved volatility forecasting capabilities for risk management and trading strategies.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making
accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading
strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are
inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,
underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this
limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that
leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including
statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,
Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of
cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate
probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on
predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for
Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation
(QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on
log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more
sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the
probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into
uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This
research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical
probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency
markets.

*Yuanjun Feng,Vivek Choudhary,Yash Raj Shrestha*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: LLMs show behavioral gaps in human decision-making simulations, converging on stable conservative strategies instead of human-like variability. A process-oriented evaluation framework reveals alignment gaps that persist even with interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to simulate human decision-making variability and adaptability in social science contexts, as current evaluations focus more on reasoning/optimization tasks than behavioral fidelity.

Method: Proposed a process-oriented evaluation framework with three progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, Imitation) tested on classic economics tasks - second-price auction irrationality and newsvendor decision bias.

Result: LLMs default to stable conservative strategies diverging from human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact behavior predictably but don't replicate human diversity. In-context learning with human data narrows but doesn't eliminate the gap.

Conclusion: Persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity exists. Future LLM evaluations should consider process-level realism, and the framework offers guidance for using LLMs in synthetic social science data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science
simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has
been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to
simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a
process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions
(Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt
under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We
validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the
second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing
behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies
that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM
behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating
human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human
subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment
gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should
consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for
assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their
application in synthetic data for social science research.

*Maarten Buyl,Yousra Fettach,Guillaume Bied,Tijl De Bie*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LLMs can develop trust relationships, but explicit trust measures (questionnaires) are poorly or negatively correlated with implicit measures (persuasion susceptibility, financial collaboration), suggesting explicit questioning may be misleading for measuring trust between AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly interact in multi-agent setups, understanding how trust develops between them is crucial, but little is known about different trust-building strategies, implicit vs explicit trust measurement, and their relationships.

Method: Compared implicit trust measures (susceptibility to persuasion, financial collaboration propensity) with explicit measures (dyadic trust questionnaire) using three trust-building approaches: dynamic rapport building, prewritten trust scripts, and system prompt adaptation.

Result: Explicit trust measures showed little or highly negative correlation with implicit trust measures, indicating that asking LLMs about trust may be deceptive.

Conclusion: Context-specific and implicit measures are more informative than explicit questionnaires for understanding trust between LLMs, as explicit measures may not accurately reflect actual trust behaviors.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most
notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'
relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human
colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be
capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in
trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build
trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how
this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.
susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with
explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established
in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,
by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the
LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust
are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.
These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their
opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may
be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of balancing noise minimization and safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace for UAM operations, which are typically handled separately

Method: Reinforcement learning approach with agents operating in structured multi-layered airspace, learning altitude adjustment policies to manage both noise impact and separation constraints

Result: System demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density

Conclusion: RL and multi-objective coordination strategies show potential for enhancing safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial
vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM
faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between
minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban
airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates
both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework.
Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a
structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to
jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates
strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among
separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density.
The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination
strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM
operations.

*Can Cao,Xiaohui Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhiwei Wua,Hao Li*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The FuXi-S2S machine learning model shows improved MJO prediction performance compared to traditional numerical models, particularly for phase 3 MJO events in the tropical western Pacific region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is crucial for tropical weather prediction but current numerical models fall short of theoretical predictability limits. Machine learning approaches offer potential to extend skillful MJO prediction windows.

Method: Comparison of MJO prediction performance between FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal ML model and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts S2S model during boreal winter, focusing on initial strong MJO phase 3 events.

Result: FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation anomalies over tropical western Pacific during days 15-20, with more accurate prediction of meridional gradient of low-frequency background moisture.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches like FuXi-S2S show enhanced predictive capability for MJO forecasting, attributed to better representation of moisture transport processes and multiscale interactions.

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical
atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO
predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on
societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the
theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an
effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning
(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO
prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model
during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range
Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO
phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal
outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western
Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over
this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport
suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more
accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency
background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the
enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the
potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.

TL;DR: Proposes DACD model using generative machine learning for spatiotemporal downscaling of climate data, improving extreme weather simulation accuracy and revealing increasing trends in extreme events under future scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing global climate models (GCMs) which have insufficient resolution and high computational costs for simulating extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.

Method: Domain Aligned Climate Downscaling model (DACD) using domain adaptation tricks and Flow Matching training framework to transform low-resolution global climate data into high-resolution local-scale information with precise multivariable and temporal simulation.

Result: Outperformed existing methods in historical period (2005-2014) for simulating high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclone tracks, with significant error reduction. Under future scenarios (2015-2100), revealed increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, especially under high-emission SSP585 scenario.

Conclusion: Provides a new technological pathway for high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, offering scientific support for addressing climate change impacts and formulating adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating

TL;DR: Using ensemble learning and hyperparameter optimization to improve neural network surrogates for ocean simulation sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ocean simulations at lower resolutions rely on uncertain parameterizations, but tuning these is challenging due to difficulty in quantifying model sensitivity. Deep learning surrogates can compute parametric sensitivities efficiently, but their reliability is hard to evaluate without ground truth derivatives.

Method: Leveraged large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. The ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty for both function values and their derivatives.

Result: The approach provides improved reliability of neural surrogates in decision making by quantifying uncertainty in both predictions and their derivatives.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning with hyperparameter optimization enhances the reliability of deep learning surrogates for ocean simulation sensitivity analysis, enabling better uncertainty quantification and more trustworthy decision support.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth
system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on
various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes.
However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify,
making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce
observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient
computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives,
but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth
derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and
ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout,
and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method
provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their
derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in
decision making.

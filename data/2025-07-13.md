### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) to address mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL approaches lack solutions for mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, limiting performance.

Method: MMoE includes description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and intra/inter-level mixture of experts for dynamic feature selection.

Result: MMoE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MMoE model effectively addresses key challenges in MEL, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPT, a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation, leveraging domain-agnostic text embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA methods for segmentation lack utilization of domain-agnostic text properties, despite advances in vision-language representation learning.

Method: Proposes CoPT, which uses LLM-generated domain descriptions and CLIP embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four UDA segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoPT effectively bridges the gap between domains by leveraging text embeddings, advancing UDA for segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework targeting the robustness of unlearned image generation models (IGMs), revealing vulnerabilities in current unlearning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and societal concerns of IGMs by evaluating the robustness of machine unlearning (MU) methods against adversarial inputs.

Method: Proposes Recall, a framework optimizing adversarial image prompts using multi-modal conditioning to test unlearning robustness.

Result: Recall outperforms baselines in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity, exposing vulnerabilities in unlearning methods.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust unlearning solutions to ensure the safety of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

### [4] [Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07148)
*Getamesay Haile Dagnaw,Yanming Zhu,Muhammad Hassan Maqsood,Wencheng Yang,Xingshuai Dong,Xuefei Yin,Alan Wee-Chung Liew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on XAI methods for biomedical image analysis, focusing on modality-aware perspectives, multimodal learning, and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing XAI surveys by providing a structured synthesis tailored to biomedical image analysis, including recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms.

Method: Systematic categorization of XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy, and examining multimodal learning and vision-language models.

Result: A detailed analysis of XAI methods, their strengths, limitations, and alignment with imaging modalities, along with evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks.

Conclusion: The survey provides a timely foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis, highlighting challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by modality conflict, introduces the MMMC dataset to study it, and evaluates three methods to mitigate the issue, with reinforcement learning performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in MLLMs by investigating modality conflict, a previously overlooked factor, and propose solutions to improve model robustness.

Method: Defines modality conflict, constructs the MMMC dataset, and tests three approaches: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperforms others in reducing hallucinations, while supervised fine-tuning shows stable performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights modality conflict as a key cause of hallucinations and offers insights for enhancing MLLM robustness.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments using UAVs, combining YOLOv8 for detection, feature matching, and hue histogram analysis for identification, validated in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous maritime surveillance is critical for applications like search and rescue and threat detection, especially when GNSS is unavailable and visual cues are the only means of identification.

Method: The method uses YOLOv8 for vessel detection, followed by feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to identify the target, and geometric principles for localization.

Result: The method was successfully demonstrated in real-world experiments during MBZIRC2023, showing effectiveness in GNSS-denied navigation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is viable for autonomous maritime surveillance in GNSS-denied environments, with potential for further refinement.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp is a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network that improves feature extraction and segmentation without extra labeled data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods rely on additional labeled data or task similarity, limiting generalizability. CL-Polyp aims to overcome this by using self-supervised contrastive learning.

Method: CL-Polyp uses contrastive learning for discriminative feature extraction and introduces two modules: MASPP for multi-scale feature fusion and CA for boundary reconstruction.

Result: CL-Polyp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving IoU by 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp is effective for clinical polyp segmentation, enhancing performance without additional annotations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model that decodes visual experiences from EEG signals using semantic captions and a transformer-based encoder, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome EEG's spatial limitations for image reconstruction by leveraging semantic captions for cognitively aligned visual decoding.

Method: Aligns EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions using a transformer-based encoder and contrastive learning. A pretrained latent diffusion model generates images from caption embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways and semantic topography.

Conclusion: The structured semantic mediation framework enables effective and interpretable visual decoding from EEG, highlighting the role of semantic levels in perception.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

### [9] [A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures, Consistency, and Cinematic Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07202)
*Mohamed Elmoghany,Ryan Rossi,Seunghyun Yoon,Subhojyoti Mukherjee,Eslam Bakr,Puneet Mathur,Gang Wu,Viet Dac Lai,Nedim Lipka,Ruiyi Zhang,Varun Manjunatha,Chien Nguyen,Daksh Dangi,Abel Salinas,Mohammad Taesiri,Hongjie Chen,Xiaolei Huang,Joe Barrow,Nesreen Ahmed,Hoda Eldardiry,Namyong Park,Yu Wang,Jaemin Cho,Anh Totti Nguyen,Zhengzhong Tu,Thien Nguyen,Dinesh Manocha,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Franck Dernoncourt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study of 32 video generation papers identifies key components for producing long-form, multi-character videos with narrative coherence and high fidelity, addressing current limitations like short duration and inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with long-form videos (beyond 16 seconds), especially in maintaining character consistency, scene layouts, and motion coherence. Some methods produce longer videos but suffer from redundancy and low diversity.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of 32 papers on video generation, identifying key architectural components and training strategies. A novel taxonomy and comparative tables categorize methods by design and performance.

Result: Identified strategies and components that improve long-form video generation, including multi-character consistency and narrative coherence.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and a taxonomy to guide future research in generating longer, more consistent, and higher-fidelity videos.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCI, an RGB-only method for clothes-changing re-identification (CC-ReID) that uses color to mitigate appearance bias without additional models or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to reliance on extra models or annotations. The paper explores color as a lightweight, annotation-free alternative.

Method: CSCI leverages foreground and background colors from raw images/video frames, using S2A self-attention to disentangle color bias from identity features.

Result: CSCI improves baselines by 2.9% (LTCC) and 5.0% (PRCC) for image ReID, and 1.0% (CCVID) and 2.5% (MeVID) for video ReID, without extra supervision.

Conclusion: Color is a cost-effective proxy for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID, validated by strong performance on four datasets.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow, resource-intensive mask generation in VFX production by automating the process.

Method: Uses machine learning for text-prompted object detection, per-frame segmentation, and video tracking, deployed via containerization.

Result: Reduced manual effort, faster preliminary composites, and enhanced segmentation data, improving VFX efficiency.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully automates mask generation, boosting VFX production efficiency and artist adoption.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal language-guided framework, DisenQ, is proposed to disentangle biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features for activity-based person identification, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person identification struggles with identity cues entangled in motion and appearance variations. Additional visual data like pose/silhouette often have extraction inaccuracies.

Method: Introduces DisenQ, a unified querying transformer that uses structured textual supervision to disentangle features, avoiding reliance on error-prone visual data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and shows strong generalization on traditional video identification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles identity disentanglement in complex scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

### [13] [LinguaMark: Do Multimodal Models Speak Fairly? A Benchmark-Based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07274)
*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark is a benchmark for evaluating multilingual capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in Visual Question Answering (VQA), revealing performance disparities and biases across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of emphasis on multilingual evaluation in LMMs, which often produce biased outputs due to limited linguistic coverage.

Method: Introduces LinguaMark, a dataset of 6,875 image-text pairs in 11 languages, evaluated using Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness metrics.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) perform best overall, while Qwen2.5 shows strong multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for better multilingual evaluation in LMMs and encourages further research with released datasets and code.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

*Chengfei Wu,Ronald Seoh,Bingxuan Li,Liqiang Zhang,Fengrong Han,Dan Goldwasser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagiC is a benchmark evaluating grounded multimodal cognition in vision-language models, assessing accuracy, reasoning quality, and visual evidence alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models genuinely perform visual reasoning or rely on biases, MagiC provides a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: MagiC includes 5,500 weakly supervised and 900 human-curated QA examples, evaluating 15 models across four dimensions: correctness, reasoning, grounding, and self-correction.

Result: The benchmark introduces metrics like MagiScore and StepSense, revealing limitations and opportunities in current visual reasoning approaches.

Conclusion: MagiC highlights the need for improved grounded reasoning in vision-language models and offers tools for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of effective automated evaluation tools for instruction-guided image editing, especially with open-source VLMs' alignment issues and proprietary models' inefficiencies.

Method: Generates a large-scale dataset (100K+ samples) and fine-tunes a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model to decode numeric scores.

Result: Outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, with significant gains in score correlation and pair-wise comparison accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed scorer enhances automated evaluation and can improve model performance, acting as a reward model for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate and scalable foundation-skin tone blending in virtual try-on applications.

Method: Proposes a method approximating Kubelka-Munk theory for faster image synthesis and builds a scalable end-to-end framework using e-commerce product data.

Result: Outperforms other techniques, validated with real-world makeup images.

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistency in visual storytelling by proposing a contrastive reinforcement learning method to improve entity identity maintenance across frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling models often fail to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to referential hallucinations.

Method: A contrastive reinforcement learning approach is introduced, using synthetic negative examples and Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function.

Result: Improvements include grounding mAP (14.8%), F1 (17.1%), pronoun grounding accuracy, and cross-frame persistence (13.7%). Well-structured stories increased by 23.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances entity identity consistency and storytelling quality in visual storytelling systems.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC is a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion, using pseudo geometries and scale manipulation to reduce annotation effort while enhancing data diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable depth completion models requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are costly to collect. PacGDC aims to minimize annotation effort while improving data diversity.

Method: PacGDC leverages ambiguities in 2D-to-3D projection to synthesize pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales. It uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators and incorporates interpolation, relocation, and unlabeled images for further diversification.

Result: PacGDC achieves strong generalizability across benchmarks, performing well in diverse scene semantics, scales, and depth patterns under zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PacGDC offers a scalable and efficient solution for generalizable depth completion, reducing reliance on large labeled datasets while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive mechanisms for particle-based shape modeling to improve representation of anatomical variability by adjusting particle configurations to local geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing particle-based shape modeling methods lack self-adaptivity, limiting their ability to accurately represent complex anatomical variability.

Method: Two mechanisms are proposed: (1) a neighborhood correspondence loss for high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm for regularization.

Result: The approach is evaluated on challenging datasets, showing improved adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking favorably against existing methods.

Conclusion: The introduced mechanisms enhance surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations, improving accuracy in representing anatomical variability.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSAGSM, a lightweight plug-and-play module for Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos, enhancing temporal and spatial modeling. It also presents the TTA dataset for table tennis PES benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability, limiting their performance in fine-grained action recognition.

Method: The proposed MSAGSM combines multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention to improve GSM, enabling better short- and long-term dependency modeling.

Result: MSAGSM achieves state-of-the-art performance across five PES benchmarks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: MSAGSM effectively addresses limitations of existing PES models, and the TTA dataset advances research in table tennis PES.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-category animal motion transfer preserves habitual behaviors, using a habit-preservation module and LLM for unobserved species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion transfer methods focus on humans and neglect animal habitual behaviors, limiting applications in animation and VR.

Method: Proposes a generative framework with a habit-preservation module and LLM integration for motion transfer to unobserved species.

Result: Validated on the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, showing superior performance in preserving habitual characteristics.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in animal motion transfer by preserving species-specific habits.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

*Yongtang Bao,Chengjie Tang,Yuze Wang,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-Wild is an interactive segmentation method for unconstrained photo collections using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing transient occlusions and lighting inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconstrained photo collections are easier to obtain but suffer from lighting inconsistencies and transient occlusions, which existing methods fail to address.

Method: Seg-Wild integrates multi-dimensional feature embeddings with 3D Gaussian Splatting and uses the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth anomalies.

Result: Seg-Wild outperforms previous methods in segmentation and reconstruction quality for in-the-wild scenes.

Conclusion: Seg-Wild offers a robust solution for segmenting and reconstructing scenes from unconstrained photo collections, with code available for public use.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis with amodal completion, outperforming multi-stage methods by integrating masking techniques and reducing reconstruction time by 95%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis and amodal completion are multi-stage, inefficient, and ignore cross-view dependencies. EscherNet++ aims to address these limitations with an end-to-end approach.

Method: Uses masked fine-tuning (input-level and feature-level) to enable novel view synthesis and amodal completion in a single model. Integrates with feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: PSNR improved by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks. Reduces reconstruction time by 95%.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ is scalable, efficient, and generalizes well to real-world occluded reconstruction, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot novel view synthesis.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC, a prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, reduces computational costs and trainable parameters while maintaining performance in text-image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) are computationally expensive to fine-tune, prompting the need for efficient interaction strategies.

Method: EPIC uses temporal prompts on intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction to align modalities efficiently.

Result: Achieves reduced resource consumption (1% of foundation model parameters) and superior performance on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, with comparable results on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC offers an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LMMs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Motivation: Address limitations of open-source MLLMs in complex reasoning tasks, particularly decision-making and problem-solving.

Method: Uses a hybrid vision encoder, GateMixer connector, and a high-quality dataset (MCoT-Instruct-287K) for two-stage CoT-formatted training and self-verification during inference.

Result: Corvid surpasses similar-scale MLLMs, excelling in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

Conclusion: Corvid advances MLLM capabilities in structured reasoning, validated by superior performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSANet improves ultrasound video segmentation by enhancing noise robustness through local and global semantic awareness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging's noise challenges hinder automated lesion or organ segmentation, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: DSANet uses AFSA and LGSA modules to fuse local and global features, mitigating noise without pixel-level dependencies.

Result: DSANet achieves higher segmentation accuracy and faster inference (FPS) than existing methods.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively addresses noise in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: A DCNN model for detecting BWV in skin lesions achieves high accuracy across datasets, outperforming existing methods, and uses XAI for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on detecting BWV, a key feature for melanoma diagnosis, prompting the need for an improved detection method.

Method: A DCNN is trained on annotated datasets created via color threshold techniques, using custom layers for BWV classification.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy (85.71%-95.05%) across datasets and outperforms conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DCNN with XAI enhances BWV detection, aiding early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR95 down to 0.07, F1-score up to 83.44).

Conclusion: Objectomaly is robust and generalizable, validated by ablation studies and real-world driving videos.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This

### [32] [Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464)
*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GAN-based blind face image restoration framework improves recognition accuracy in adverse weather by integrating local statistical feature transformation and degradation-agnostic feature embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather degrades image quality, reducing face recognition accuracy. Existing methods lack dedicated modules for weather-induced degradations, causing distorted textures and structures.

Method: Proposes a GAN-based framework with two modules: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) for enhancing structure/color fidelity and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) for robust feature extraction under adverse weather.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion-based methods, reducing texture distortions and improving facial structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: The SFFT and DAFE modules enhance structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

### [33] [Temporal Unlearnable Examples: Preventing Personal Video Data from Unauthorized Exploitation by Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07483)
*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) to protect personal video data from unauthorized use in Visual Object Tracking (VOT), addressing inefficiencies and limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in VOT, where unauthorized use of personal videos for training commercial models is overlooked.

Method: Proposes a novel generative framework for TUEs, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt tracker learning and ensure data-privacy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models and datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively safeguards video data-privacy in VOT, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Xinyuan Chang,Xinran Liu,Zheng Pan,Mu Xu,Ding Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMA, a benchmark for associating global SD maps with online HD maps to improve autonomous vehicle navigation, and proposes the Map Association Transformer as a baseline method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with integrating global SD maps and online HD maps for hybrid navigation, limiting their real-world usability.

Method: The authors create the OMA benchmark with 480k roads and 260k lane paths, and propose the Map Association Transformer, using path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: OMA provides a dataset and metrics to evaluate models, and the proposed transformer framework enhances geometric and topological understanding.

Conclusion: The OMA benchmark and Map Association Transformer advance hybrid navigation capabilities for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

*Binxu Li,Minkai Xu,Meihua Dang,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMPO introduces a novel method for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by minimizing reverse KL divergence, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diffusion models by aligning them with human preferences, addressing suboptimal mean-seeking optimization in existing methods.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), which minimizes reverse KL divergence for alignment.

Result: DMPO outperforms existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across datasets.

Conclusion: DMPO provides a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, combining theory and practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

### [36] [GGMotion: Group Graph Dynamics-Kinematics Networks for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07515)
*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion introduces a group graph dynamics-kinematics network to model human motion, leveraging physical priors and geometric equivariance for more realistic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect physical dependencies between joints, leading to unrealistic motions. GGMotion aims to address this by incorporating dynamics and kinematics priors.

Method: Proposes a group graph network with radial fields, inter/intra-group interaction modules, and equivariant MLPs for joint feature updates. Includes an auxiliary loss for motion prior supervision.

Result: Achieves superior performance on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW benchmarks, especially in short-term motion prediction.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively models human motion with improved physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled datasets in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of extensive, accurately labeled multi-view video datasets hinders progress in 4D object segmentation for dynamic scenes.

Method: The authors present MUVOD, a dataset with 17 scenes, 7830 RGB images, and segmentation masks for 4D motion tracking. They also propose an evaluation metric and baseline method.

Result: MUVOD includes 459 instances of 73 categories, providing a benchmark for multi-view video segmentation. A subset is also proposed for 3D object segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MUVOD serves as a foundational benchmark for advancing 4D and 3D object segmentation methods, with publicly available data and tools.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

### [38] [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521)
*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spline-based trajectory representation for dense point modeling, improving spatial coherence and temporal interpolation without relying on heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for trajectory modeling either use opaque neural networks or heuristic-based explicit techniques, lacking spatial coherence and under-exploring implicit representations for sparse temporal signals.

Method: A spline-based trajectory representation with explicit knot degrees of freedom is introduced, along with a low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for knot characteristics.

Result: The method excels in temporal interpolation and dynamic scene reconstruction, maintaining motion coherence without traditional constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by balancing spatial coherence and temporal accuracy, offering a more intuitive and efficient solution.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX introduces a remote sensing foundation model using mixture-of-modality experts and modality-aware pruning to address modality mismatches and fine-tuning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models focus on specific modalities, causing mismatches for diverse applications and making fine-tuning expensive.

Method: MAPEX uses a modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and modality-aware pruning to create efficient, task-specific models.

Result: MAPEX outperforms fully supervised training and state-of-the-art foundation models on diverse remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: MAPEX effectively bridges modality gaps and simplifies fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "linear reasoning bottleneck" in VLMs, measured by the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), and shows it stems from language model reasoning failures, not perception. Task-dependent interventions can solve this, with postfix tuning revealing dormant reasoning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why VLMs struggle with abstract reasoning tasks despite good visual embeddings, focusing on the "linear reasoning bottleneck."

Method: Introduces LSC to measure linear separability of visual embeddings, uses postfix tuning to probe reasoning pathways, and tests task-dependent interventions.

Result: Finds VLMs have dormant reasoning pathways; semantic tasks need pathway activation, while complex tasks require weight adaptation. Improving representation quality can fail on new prompts.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs requires targeted alignment, not just better representation learning, offering a new analysis framework.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

TL;DR: Proposes DGKD-WLSS, a framework combining diffusion-guided knowledge distillation and depth-guided feature fusion to improve weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods perform poorly in low-light due to image degradation and weak supervision constraints, leading to unreliable class activation maps and ambiguous pseudo-labels.

Method: Uses Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) to align features and Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2) to integrate depth maps for better structural learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS effectively addresses low-light challenges, enhancing feature learning and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Method: Uses hierarchical adapter modules, shared subspace projection, MTL Decoder, and Sinkhorn-K-means clustering for anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieves AUC of 97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% on MVTec AD, outperforming recent models.

framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the

97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

*Wenfeng Jia,Bin Liang,Yuxi Lu,Attavit Wilaiwongsakul,Muhammad Arif Khan,Lihong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOTA is a multi-scale inference strategy for 3D flood mapping, improving accuracy and coverage without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flood mapping products lack spatial detail or ignore depth, hindering disaster response.

Method: HOTA uses overlapping tiles on Sentinel-2 images with SegFormer and a DEM-based depth module for 3D mapping.

Result: HOTA improves IoU to 84% and achieves <0.5m boundary error in Kempsey flood case study.

Conclusion: HOTA enables accurate, large-scale 3D flood mapping for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 is a diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework, the first to use multi-view diffusion models for consistent, high-fidelity hair transfer across perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods lack consistency in multi-view hair generation, limiting real-world applications like digital humans.

Method: Uses a multi-view training pipeline with a Bald Converter, inpainting model, and face-finetuned diffusion model. Integrates polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention for smooth transitions.

Result: Achieves detailed, realistic hairstyle transfer with seamless consistency across views, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 sets a new benchmark for multi-view hair transfer, with publicly available code.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer

transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance in video object tracking.

Method: Hierarchical motion estimation (lightweight linear prediction + non-linear refinement) and optimized memory bank (long-term/short-term memory frames).

Result: 9.6% and 7.2% relative AUC improvements on LaSOT and LaSOText; larger gains on smaller models.

Conclusion: Trainless, low-overhead enhancements effectively boost long-term tracking performance.

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object
tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter,
and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation
strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the
effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting

TL;DR: LOSC method improves open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans by consolidating noisy labels and training a 3D network, outperforming SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy and sparse point labels from back-projecting image semantics onto 3D point clouds in driving settings.

Method: Consolidate labels for spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to augmentations, then train a 3D network (LOSC).

Result: Outperforms SOTA in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: LOSC is a simple yet effective method for improving segmentation accuracy in lidar scans.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

### [47] [SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610)
*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench is introduced as a multi-modal benchmark to evaluate spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing performance gaps and unexpected behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of spatial visualization in MLLMs are embedded in broader assessments, risking reliability due to potential data overlap.

Method: SpatialViz-Bench includes 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities with 1,180 problems, tested on 33 MLLMs.

Result: Performance varies widely; models show misaligned difficulty perception, 2D-to-3D cliffs, and over-reliance on formula derivation.

Conclusion: MLLMs still struggle with spatial visualization, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks like SpatialViz-Bench.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLU introduces a novel Vision-Language Uncertainty (ViLU) framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in VLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Method: ViLU integrates visual and textual embeddings via cross-attention, training an uncertainty predictor as a loss-agnostic binary classifier.

Result: Significant improvements over existing methods on datasets like ImageNet-1k, CC12M, and LAION-400M.

Conclusion: ViLU's architecture and training approach effectively quantify uncertainty, making it suitable for post-hoc settings.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

### [49] [T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633)
*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-GVC is a trajectory-guided generative video coding framework that improves video reconstruction in ultra-low bitrate scenarios by combining semantic-aware motion sampling and diffusion-based guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generative video coding are limited by domain specificity or reliance on high-level text guidance, leading to unrealistic reconstructions. T-GVC aims to address these issues.

Method: T-GVC uses semantic-aware sparse motion sampling to link low-level motion tracking with high-level semantics, reducing bitrate while preserving temporal details. It also incorporates trajectory-aligned loss constraints in diffusion processes for plausible motion.

Result: T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art methods in ultra-low bitrate conditions and achieves better motion control than text-guided approaches.

Conclusion: T-GVC introduces a novel direction for generative video coding by leveraging geometric motion modeling, offering improved performance and motion accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

*F. Xavier Gaya-Morey,Julia Sanchez-Perez,Cristina Manresa-Yee,Jose M. Buades-Rubio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses age-related bias in deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, focusing on the elderly. It identifies disparities, proposes mitigation strategies, and shows improved accuracy for elderly individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning FER models exhibit demographic biases, particularly age-related, compromising fairness and reliability. The study aims to understand and mitigate these biases, especially for the elderly.

Method: The study investigates recognition performance across age groups, uses Explainable AI (XAI) to identify disparities, and proposes three bias mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Models are trained on AffectNet with age labels and validated on balanced datasets.

Result: Results show improved accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmaps reveal more relevant facial region attention for each age group.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be mitigated with simple training modifications, and approximate demographic labels can enhance fairness in affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

*Fengqian Pang,Chunyue Lei,Hongfei Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Zhiqiang Xing,Huafeng Wang,Chuyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolCLIP combines cell video and molecule data to improve drug MoA recognition using a visual-language model, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for MoA recognition focus on spatial cell features but ignore temporal dynamics and molecular data, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes MolCLIP, a visual-language model integrating microscopic cell videos and molecular data, using a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and metric learning.

Result: MolCLIP improves drug identification by 51.2% and MoA recognition by 20.5% in mAP on the MitoDataset.

Conclusion: MolCLIP effectively leverages temporal and molecular data to enhance MoA recognition, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model for efficient keypoint annotation in cervical vertebrae radiographs, aiding growth potential prediction in pediatric orthodontics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate growth potential estimation is vital for effective orthodontic treatment, but manual keypoint annotation is labor-intensive.

Method: ARNet uses an Interaction-guided recalibration network and morphology-aware loss to streamline keypoint annotation.

Result: ARNet reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and shows strong performance across datasets.

Conclusion: ARNet is a significant AI-assisted tool for pediatric orthodontic growth assessment.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, an AU-enhanced dynamic facial expression recognition architecture, integrating AU-expression knowledge to improve deep learning models. It outperforms SOTA methods and addresses data label imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating quantified AU-expression knowledge and tackling data imbalance in datasets.

Method: Quantifies AU contributions, designs a weight matrix, and integrates AU loss with deep learning outcomes. Validated on existing models and datasets.

Result: AU-DFER outperforms SOTA methods without extra computation and improves results. AU loss redesign helps address label imbalance.

Conclusion: Integrating AU knowledge and diverse loss functions enhances DFER effectiveness, highlighting the importance of addressing data imbalance.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationale-enhanced decoding (RED) to improve multi-modal reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by addressing the issue of ignored rationales in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore generated rationales in CoT reasoning, undermining grounding and accuracy.

Method: Reformulates multi-modal CoT as KL-constrained reward maximization and proposes RED, a plug-and-play decoding strategy that combines image- and rationale-conditional token distributions.

Result: RED consistently outperforms standard CoT and other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs, enhancing reasoning faithfulness and accuracy.

Conclusion: RED provides a practical solution for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Mamba, a novel method for underwater monocular depth estimation, addressing challenges in state scanning and unreliable datasets with a tree-aware scanning strategy and a new benchmark, BlueDepth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods struggle with underwater depth estimation due to inflexible state scanning and unreliable datasets, prompting the need for a more adaptive approach.

Method: Proposes Tree-Mamba, featuring a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum spanning tree for flexible feature aggregation and introduces the BlueDepth benchmark with reliable labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperforms leading methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating strong multi-scale feature representation and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba effectively addresses UMDE challenges, with its tree-aware strategy and reliable dataset (BlueDepth) enhancing accuracy and performance.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for local motion blur deblurring using a trainable mask predictor and intra-frame motion analyzer, achieving better performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring methods struggle with inefficient resource allocation and handling spatially varying blur patterns.

Method: Proposes a trainable mask predictor to identify blurred regions and an intra-frame motion analyzer for adaptive blur restoration. Uses structural reparameterization for computational efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing FLOPs by 49% while maintaining high performance on local and global blur datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses local motion blur with improved efficiency and accuracy, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: CrossVLAD is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models (VLMs), introducing CRAFT, an efficient attack method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security challenges in unified VLMs caused by adversarial inputs across unpredictable task instructions.

Method: Introduces CrossVLAD, a dataset with GPT-4-assisted annotations, and CRAFT, a region-based attack framework with token-alignment.

Result: CRAFT outperforms existing methods in cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of CRAFT in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Motivation: To investigate if dataset bias exists in popular open-source chest X-ray datasets, given the sensitivity of medical data and the importance of unbiased AI in medical imaging.

Method: Applied simple dataset transformations and tested multiple network architectures on NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest datasets.

Result: Not explicitly stated, but the goal is to identify bias and encourage explainable research.

Conclusion: The work aims to promote transparency in medical imaging research and the development of more open-source datasets.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A simplified 3D promptable segmentation method is introduced to address the limitations of SAM in handling 3D medical imaging, reducing inference time and complexity while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's 2D architecture is unsuitable for 3D medical imaging, and existing 3D methods are computationally intensive and complex.

Method: The proposed method simplifies 3D segmentation by eliminating sliding-window inference and prompt management complexities, inspired by SegVol.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced inference time and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical solution for 3D medical imaging segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

### [60] [Energy-Guided Decoding for Object Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07731)
*Xixi Liu,Ailin Deng,Christopher Zach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by proposing an energy-based decoding method to balance the 'Yes' ratio in VQA datasets, improving accuracy and reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs is crucial for safe deployment, as existing methods are restrictive or require external knowledge.

Method: An energy-based decoding method dynamically selects hidden states from layers with minimal energy scores to balance the 'Yes' ratio.

Result: The method improves accuracy by 4.82% and reduces the yes-ratio gap by 8.81% across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, effective, and less biased, enhancing performance in VQA tasks.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) improves early human activity recognition using event-based vision sensors, outperforming previous methods by 2% in accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early recognition of human activities is vital for safety and responsiveness in human-robot/machine interfaces. Event-based vision sensors offer high temporal resolution, but existing methods limit early prediction capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a high-rate two-stream SNN to process events at a high rate for early predictions, addressing accuracy limitations of prior SNN approaches.

Result: The proposed SNN outperforms previous work by 2% in final accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset and is benchmarked for early recognition performance.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates practical impact in real-world tasks like early action triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDST, a sparse-dense side-tuning architecture for Video Temporal Grounding, improving adaptability and performance while reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting adaptability to new domains, and overlook the sparse nature of Moment Retrieval.

Method: Proposes SDST, an anchor-free side-tuning architecture with Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, integrating InternVideo2 backbone.

Result: Achieves highly competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, reducing parameters by up to 73%.

Conclusion: SDST significantly improves existing side-tuning methods, offering efficient and effective adaptation for Video Temporal Grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

*Charlie Budd,Silvère Ségaud,Matthew Elliot,Graeme Stasiuk,Yijing Xie,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-RAFT improves fluorescence-guided neurosurgery by enabling cross-modal image correspondence between hyperspectral images under different lighting, reducing errors by 36.6% over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical decision-making with real-time quantitative fluorescence measurements requires accurate cross-modal image alignment in dynamic surgical environments.

Method: X-RAFT, a modified RAFT optical flow model, uses distinct encoders for each modality and self-supervised fine-tuning with flow-cycle-consistency.

Result: X-RAFT reduces errors by 36.6% compared to baseline and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively addresses cross-modal correspondence challenges, improving fluorescence quantification in neurosurgery.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

### [64] [Deep Learning based 3D Volume Correlation for Additive Manufacturing Using High-Resolution Industrial X-ray Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07757)
*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method improves geometric accuracy in additive manufacturing by using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) to compare CAD and XCT volumes, achieving faster and more accurate results than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric inaccuracies in additive manufacturing (AM) components due to shrinkage and deformations can affect performance and lifespan. Current DVC methods struggle with registration accuracy and computational challenges.

Method: A deep learning approach estimates voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes using dynamic patch-based processing. A Binary Difference Map (BDM) is introduced for evaluation.

Result: The method improves Dice Score by 9.2% and voxel match rate by 9.9%, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: This work enables more reliable and efficient AM production, with potential for closed-loop compensation in industrial applications.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOOTER is a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, providing guidelines, tools, and a benchmark dataset, revealing that current attacks fail to be imperceptible to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses against adversarial attacks rely on norm-bounded constraints, but unrestricted attacks bypass these. A unified framework is needed to assess their imperceptibility.

Method: Introduces SCOOTER, an open-source framework with guidelines for human evaluations, tools for data collection, and a benchmark dataset. Conducts large-scale human vs. model comparisons.

Result: Three color-space and three diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. GPT-4o detects only four of six attacks.

Conclusion: Automated vision systems misalign with human perception, highlighting the need for SCOOTER as a benchmark for unrestricted adversarial attack evaluation.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for scaling vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos using reinforcement learning, featuring a dataset, training pipeline, and infrastructure for efficient long video reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of long video reasoning in VLMs by integrating a large-scale dataset, a two-stage training pipeline, and optimized infrastructure.

Method: Combines chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP) for efficient training.

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B outperforms benchmarks like VideoMME and matches Gemini-1.5-Pro in reasoning tasks, with MR-SP achieving 2.1x speedup in training.

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1 advances long video reasoning in VLMs, with publicly released training infrastructure supporting diverse modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

### [67] [Where are we with calibration under dataset shift in image classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07780)
*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates calibration techniques for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training methods. Key findings include the effectiveness of entropy regularization and label smoothing, the robustness of post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure, and the trade-off between in-distribution and shift calibration. Ensembling and finetuning foundation models yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the calibration of image classifiers under real-world dataset shifts, providing practical guidelines for robust calibration.

Method: Comparison of post-hoc and in-training calibration methods across eight classification tasks and various natural shifts, including analysis of ensembling effects and finetuning from foundation models.

Result: Entropy regularization and label smoothing work best under shift; post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure are robust; recent shift-specific methods don't outperform simpler ones; ensembling and finetuning foundation models improve calibration.

Conclusion: Combining ensembling with finetuning foundation models and applying calibration before ensembling yields the most robust calibration under dataset shifts.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: TreeBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, focusing on traceable evidence and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR, a training paradigm, improves performance on benchmarks like TreeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack a holistic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning capabilities, particularly for traceable evidence and complex reasoning.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence via bounding boxes, and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR uses reinforcement learning to jointly supervise localization and reasoning.

Result: TreeBench includes 405 challenging QA pairs, with advanced models scoring below 60% accuracy. TreeVGR improves performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traceability is crucial for advancing vision-grounded reasoning, as demonstrated by TreeBench and TreeVGR.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks focus on spatial reasoning, with datasets often relying on superficial cues. This gap hinders genuine understanding of spatial relationships in AI systems.

Method: The authors created S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with 200k+ vision-language pairs from 900+ indoor scenes, featuring 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries devoid of object names to avoid biases.

Result: Benchmarks show state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs struggle with the dataset, highlighting its necessity for advancing spatial reasoning in AI.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D and the 3D-SRS benchmark aim to improve spatially aware AI, supporting embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network using 3D CNNs and differential frame fusion to improve heart rate measurement accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models lack accuracy, robustness, and generalization under complex conditions, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: The method combines 3D CNNs, differential frame fusion, Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention, and a dynamic hybrid loss function to enhance rPPG signal reconstruction.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.58 on the challenging MMPD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates superior robustness and generalization, making it a promising solution for non-contact heart rate measurement in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT introduces instance-aware prompts for vision transformers, improving performance by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge using PCA, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VPT uses fixed dataset-level prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance due to dataset variance. ViaPT aims to address this by incorporating instance-specific prompts.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts per input, fuses them with dataset-level prompts, and uses PCA to retain key information, reducing parameters while improving performance.

Result: ViaPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 34 datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: ViaPT establishes a new paradigm for optimizing visual prompts, effectively balancing dataset and instance knowledge for better results.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework to address performance degradation in multi-modal models due to missing or incomplete inputs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods for handling missing modalities are limited by static prompts and unreliable performance when critical modalities are absent.

Method: The SyP framework introduces a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to balance information across modalities.

Result: SyP achieves significant performance improvements on three visual recognition datasets, showing robustness under varying missing rates.

Conclusion: The SyP framework effectively handles missing modalities, offering superior adaptability and reliability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting, comparing patient-specific and multi-patient training strategies under clinical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is crucial for precise proton therapy, but current deep learning methods lack exploration of transformer architectures despite their success in trajectory forecasting.

Method: Two training strategies (patient-specific and multi-patient) were evaluated using DRRs from 31 patients. Performance was measured using ADE and FDE on planning and treatment data.

Result: Patient-specific models outperformed multi-patient models on planning data, but multi-patient models showed better robustness to anatomical variability and comparable performance on treatment data without retraining.

Conclusion: ViT-based models are effective for tumor motion forecasting; patient-specific models offer precision, while multi-patient models provide robust, ready-to-use performance for clinical settings.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

*Richard Dirauf,Florian Wolz,Dario Zanca,Björn Eskofier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of content-based puzzle solvers under corruptions like missing pieces and eroded edges, finding deep learning models, especially the Positional Diffusion model, adapt well with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing puzzle solvers lack realistic challenges for real-world applications like artefact reassembly, prompting an investigation into their robustness under corruptions.

Method: Three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions (missing pieces, eroded edges, eroded contents) are introduced to test heuristic and deep learning-based solvers.

Result: Standard solvers decline rapidly with corruption, but deep learning models, particularly the Positional Diffusion model, improve robustness through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study identifies key limitations and suggests research directions for enhancing automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

### [75] [Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07831)
*Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Dingyou Wang,Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yu Wu,Guanbin Li,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCIS is a simple yet effective baseline for class-incremental image segmentation (CIS), addressing plasticity loss and data order reliance by leveraging query-based transformers and perfect feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupled frameworks in CIS suffer from plasticity loss and heavy reliance on input data order, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: SimCIS directly selects image features for query assignment to ensure perfect alignment, introduces cross-stage consistency, and uses a visual query-based replay mechanism.

Result: SimCIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS provides a powerful and simple solution for CIS, effectively addressing key challenges and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

### [76] [3D-ADAM: A Dataset for 3D Anomaly Detection in Advanced Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07838)
*Paul McHard,Florent P. Audonnet,Oliver Summerell,Sebastian Andraos,Paul Henderson,Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for high-precision 3D anomaly detection, addressing the lack of real-world datasets in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects significantly reduce manufacturing yield, but current datasets lack real-world relevance, hindering the development of effective defect detection methods.

Method: 3D-ADAM includes 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 parts, with 27,346 annotated defects and 8,110 machine element features, captured under real industrial conditions.

Result: Evaluation shows 3D-ADAM poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art models, highlighting its industrial relevance and quality.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM aims to advance robust 3D anomaly detection models for modern manufacturing by providing a realistic benchmark.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THUNDER is a benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, enabling efficient comparison, feature analysis, and robustness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in digital pathology is hard to assess due to many concurrent methods; benchmarking is critical for reliable model usage.

Method: THUNDER evaluates 23 foundation models on 16 datasets, analyzing features, robustness, and uncertainty.

Result: THUNDER supports diverse tasks and models, providing insights into feature spaces and robustness.

Conclusion: THUNDER is a dynamic, easy-to-use benchmark for comparing digital pathology models, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

*Jiayi Wu,Tianfu Wang,Md Abu Bakr Siddique,Md Jahidul Islam,Cornelia Fermuller,Yiannis Aloimonos,Christopher A. Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLURPP combines latent diffusion models with scene decomposition for efficient underwater image restoration, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater image restoration methods are computationally intensive and produce artifacts in complex scenes.

Method: SLURPP integrates pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition and uses a synthetic data pipeline for training.

Result: SLURPP is 200X faster and improves PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks, with better qualitative results on real-world data.

Conclusion: SLURPP advances underwater image restoration by balancing efficiency and accuracy, validated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

### [79] [MIRA: A Novel Framework for Fusing Modalities in Medical RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07902)
*Jinhong Wang,Tajamul Ashraf,Zongyan Han,Jorma Laaksonen,Rao Mohammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The MIRA framework improves factual accuracy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic context adjustment and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually inconsistent responses in medical diagnosis, and RAG, while helpful, can introduce retrieval-related challenges like insufficient or excessive context.

Method: MIRA introduces a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module for dynamic context adjustment and a medical RAG framework with image embeddings and a query-rewrite module for multimodal reasoning.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks, significantly improving factual accuracy.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively balances internal and external knowledge, enhancing MLLM reliability in medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

*Mateusz Wasala,Mateusz Smolarczyk,Michal Danilowicz,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an embedded, unsupervised architecture for feature point detection in VSLAM, using a quantised SuperPoint CNN, optimized for FPGA SoC platforms to achieve high performance with minimal computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate position estimation in navigation systems for autonomous platforms requires efficient, high-quality feature point detection, especially in resource-constrained environments like mobile or embedded systems.

Method: Implemented a quantised SuperPoint CNN on an FPGA SoC (AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+), leveraging Brevitas and FINN for quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation, achieving 54 fps on 640x480 images.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art solutions, processing images at 54 fps while maintaining high detection quality, validated on the TUM dataset.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances computational efficiency and detection accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited platforms for visual odometry tasks.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy, CiCi, is proposed for rPPG tasks, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency in signals to enhance real-time adaptation without source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods for rPPG face limitations in privacy and real-time adaptation, prompting the need for a more practical solution.

Method: The CiCi framework integrates expert knowledge-based self-supervised learning, using consistency and inconsistency priors, with a gradient control mechanism for stable adaptation.

Result: Outperforms existing techniques on five datasets under TTA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The CiCi framework effectively addresses real-world deployment challenges in rPPG, offering robust and privacy-compliant adaptation.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time ID algorithm for mice in digital home cages improves tracking and identification accuracy using custom ear tags, motion cues, and transformer-based classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated monitoring of mice enhances data accuracy and welfare, but individual identification is challenging due to housing density and similar appearances.

Method: Developed a pipeline with MouseTracks (tracker), Mouseformer (ID classifier), and MouseMap (tracklet associator) for real-time ID assignment at 30 fps.

Result: The pipeline improves tracking efficiency and reduces ID switches across strains and environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The system enables precise, continuous monitoring of mice, advancing research and welfare.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

TL;DR: A method for synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos using a data curation pipeline (M3arsSynth) and a video generator (MarsGen), outperforming terrestrial-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for realistic Martian landscape videos for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation, despite challenges like data scarcity and domain gaps.

Method: Combines M3arsSynth (reconstructs 3D Martian environments from stereo images) and MarsGen (synthesizes videos with visual and geometric consistency).

Result: Outperforms terrestrial-trained models in visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the challenges of Martian video synthesis, enabling realistic simulations.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry Forcing improves video diffusion models by aligning their representations with 3D geometric features, enhancing visual quality and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models often lack geometric awareness, limiting their ability to represent the 3D nature of videos.

Method: Proposes Geometry Forcing, using Angular and Scale Alignment to align diffusion model features with a pretrained geometric foundation model.

Result: Significantly improves visual quality and 3D consistency in video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively bridges the gap between video diffusion models and 3D geometric understanding.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Online Spatio-Temporal understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), highlighting challenges in real-world embodied perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate MLLMs offline with fixed inputs, but real-world scenarios require dynamic, incremental processing of observations.

Method: OST-Bench uses 1.4k scenes and 10k QA pairs from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes to test MLLMs' online spatio-temporal reasoning.

Result: Leading MLLMs struggle with complex spatio-temporal tasks, showing declining accuracy as exploration and memory demands increase.

Conclusion: OST-Bench identifies key challenges in online embodied reasoning and provides resources to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

TL;DR: The paper investigates CLIP's limitations in learning binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs) and identifies data properties as the key issue, not batch size or hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models fail to distinguish fine-grained object-attribute pairs (e.g., 'yellow submarine' vs. 'blue submarine'). Previous fixes like hard negatives or architecture changes were incomplete. The paper explores how data properties affect binding.

Method: The study uses a synthetic dataset to rigorously analyze data properties influencing CLIP's binding ability, such as attribute density, caption completeness, and saliency bias.

Result: Common natural data properties (low attribute density, incomplete captions, saliency bias) harm binding. Neither scaling batch size nor hard negatives helps; only data with specific properties enables reliable binding.

Conclusion: Data properties, not training or architecture, are critical for CLIP to learn binding. Addressing these properties can improve CLIP's performance in fine-grained tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

*Jeongseok Hyun,Sukjun Hwang,Su Ho Han,Taeoh Kim,Inwoong Lee,Dongyoon Wee,Joon-Young Lee,Seon Joo Kim,Minho Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STTM is a training-free method for merging spatio-temporal tokens in video LLMs, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face quadratic computational scaling with token count, limiting efficiency. STTM addresses this by exploiting overlooked spatial and temporal redundancy in videos.

Method: STTM transforms frames into multi-granular spatial tokens using a quadtree, then merges tokens temporally. It is query-agnostic and allows KV cache reuse.

Result: STTM achieves 2× speed-up with 0.5% accuracy drop (50% token budget) and 3× speed-up with 2% drop (30% budget), outperforming existing methods on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: STTM efficiently reduces computational cost in video LLMs by leveraging spatio-temporal redundancy, offering significant speed-ups with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

*Weihao Xia,Cengiz Oztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASIC, a unified evaluation framework for brain visual decoding, addressing limitations of coarse metrics by focusing on structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding lack granularity, neuroscientific grounding, and fail to capture fine-grained distinctions, necessitating a more comprehensive framework.

Method: BASIC uses hierarchical segmentation-based metrics for structural fidelity and multimodal large language models for semantic-level comparisons, benchmarking diverse decoding methods.

Result: The framework provides discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive evaluation of brain visual decoding methods across datasets.

Conclusion: BASIC offers a more robust foundation for assessing visual decoding methods by integrating multigranular evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for few-shot keypoint detection using sketches addresses cross-modal embedding and user-specific styles, achieving success in novel keypoints and classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in few-shot keypoint detection when source data is unavailable, with sketches offering a source-free solution.

Method: Prototypical setup with grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation.

Result: Successful few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in few-shot keypoint detection using sketches.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

*Shivam Duggal,Sanghyun Byun,William T. Freeman,Antonio Torralba,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity, predicting token count for images in one forward pass, matching performance of multi-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length representations in visual learning ignore input complexity. Adaptive methods exist but require test-time search. KARL aims to simplify this.

Method: KARL uses a single-pass approach, halting when approximate Kolmogorov Complexity is met, trained via Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning.

Result: KARL performs comparably to adaptive tokenizers while being more efficient. Scaling laws and conceptual studies align with human intuition.

Conclusion: KARL offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach to adaptive tokenization, bridging AIT and visual representation learning.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs by improving quantization strategies and minimizing information loss.

Method: Retains latent dimensions for feature preservation and uses sub-codebooks for quantization. Evaluates performance on 512p and 2k resolution benchmarks.

Result: \NickName outperforms existing methods, achieving better rFID (0.49 vs. 0.91) on ImageNet and superior PSNR on zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: \NickName advances VQ-VAE performance in reconstruction, particularly for HD image tasks, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD

*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how word co-occurrence statistics in CLIP/LMM pretraining data affect model performance, showing a strong correlation between PMI and accuracy, and highlights the need for better compositional generalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how concept combinations in training data impact compositional generalization in CLIP/LMMs, especially for uncommon pairings.

Method: Uses PMI to measure word co-occurrence, tests on synthetic and edited natural images, and evaluates CLIP/LMM performance.

Result: Strong correlation between PMI and accuracy (r=0.97 for CLIP), with significant accuracy gaps (14%) between high and low PMI pairs. Effect also observed in LMMs (r=0.70 for TextVQA).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved algorithms/architectures for compositional generalization in multimodal models without exponentially scaling training data.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified agentic framework using LLMs for fault-recovery planning and continuous control in chemical processes, achieving high success rates and performance comparable to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workforce shortages and complex fault scenarios in chemical processes by integrating symbolic reasoning with adaptive control.

Method: Combines LLMs with Finite State Machines (FSMs) for planning, simulation, and iterative refinement through a Validator-Reprompting loop.

Result: Achieves 100% valid-path success in fault recovery and comparable performance to PID control in continuous process modulation.

Conclusion: LLMs, with structured feedback and modular agents, can unify symbolic planning and continuous control, enhancing automation resilience in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: The paper proposes BOOST, a method to mitigate bias in AI models for art classification by dynamically adjusting sampling and temperature scaling, evaluated on KaoKore and PACS datasets with a new metric, SODC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in AI for art classification, due to imbalanced datasets, compromises fairness and accuracy, especially for rare styles. Prior work overlooks bias in OOD data.

Method: Proposes BOOST, an OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method, adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities for equitable class representation.

Result: BOOST balances performance and fairness, reducing class-wise bias, as shown on KaoKore and PACS datasets using the SODC metric.

Conclusion: BOOST is a robust solution for debiasing AI models in art classification, ensuring fairness without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illicit activities in supply chains are hard to detect due to sparse, corrupted data, requiring new methods beyond traditional ML.

Method: Uses neurosymbolic methods and a question tree approach with LLMs to classify news articles on forced labor.

Result: Compares human and machine classification effectiveness for identifying illicit activities.

Conclusion: Proposes a systematic way to evaluate and detect illicit supply chain activities without large datasets.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based translation agents are limited to text-only inputs, missing valuable visual and contextual cues.

Method: ViDove integrates multimodal memory and domain-specific knowledge modules, inspired by human translators.

Result: Achieves 28% higher BLEU scores and 15% better SubER than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ViDove demonstrates superior translation quality and introduces DoveBench, a new benchmark for video subtitling.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: The paper highlights computational challenges in filtering harmful content in LLMs, showing inefficiency in prompt and output filters, and argues for integrating safety into LLM internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing misuse of LLMs by studying alignment challenges, focusing on filtering harmful content in inputs and outputs.

Method: Analyzes computational challenges in filtering prompts and outputs, using cryptographic hardness assumptions.

Result: Demonstrates inefficiency in prompt filters and intractability in output filters, with relaxed mitigation approaches also facing barriers.

Conclusion: Safety requires integrating judgment into LLM internals; external filters or black-box access are insufficient.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Motivation: To address the need for high responsiveness and economic efficiency in supply chain transportation by integrating simulation and intelligent decision-making.

Method: Sim-to-Dec includes a generative simulation module using autoregressive modeling and a dual-aware decision model refined through end-to-end optimization.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements in timely delivery rates and profit.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec effectively meets the requirements for a robust and generalizable simulation-decision framework in supply chain transportation.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrugMCTS integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing, outperforming existing methods without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of LLMs in scientific reasoning beyond pretraining knowledge and address computational overhead or inefficiency in exploiting structured data.

Method: Proposes DrugMCTS, a framework with five specialized agents for structured reasoning using RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Result: DrugMCTS outperforms Deepseek-R1 by over 20% and achieves higher recall and robustness on DrugBank and KIBA datasets.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning, agent collaboration, and feedback-driven search are crucial for advancing LLM applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

*Weihao Tan,Changjiu Jiang,Yu Duan,Mingcong Lei,Jiageng Li,Yitian Hong,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo is a benchmark based on Stardew Valley for evaluating AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations, combining livelihood tasks and social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack simultaneous evaluation of production and social skills in AI agents.

Method: StarDojo features 1,000 tasks across farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions, with a subset of 100 tasks for efficient evaluation. It offers a unified interface supporting parallel execution.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4.1 achieve only a 12.7% success rate, highlighting challenges in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: StarDojo aims to advance research in robust, open-ended agents for complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

TL;DR: AlgEval is a framework to study the algorithms LLMs learn, focusing on emergent search algorithms, aiming for interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the algorithms LLMs use, addressing a gap in research focused on scaling rather than algorithmic understanding.

Method: Proposes AlgEval, combining top-down hypotheses and bottom-up circuit-level analysis of attention and hidden states.

Result: Case study demonstrates hypothesis formation and testing, revealing algorithmic primitives in LLMs.

Conclusion: AlgEval offers a principled approach to interpretability, potentially improving training efficiency and architecture design.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

TL;DR: The paper examines the rigor of explanations in high-risk ML applications, focusing on undesired facets of rule-based models like redundancy and negative overlap. It develops algorithms to analyze these issues and critiques widely used learning tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-risk ML applications, incorrect explanations can mislead human decision-makers. Despite interpretability being elusive, rule-based models are widely used, necessitating scrutiny of their flaws.

Method: The paper develops algorithms to analyze undesired facets of rule-based ML models, such as negative overlap and redundancy.

Result: The study finds that widely used tools for learning rule-based models produce rule sets with negative facets.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for improved methods to ensure rigorous explanations in high-risk ML applications, given the flaws in current rule-based models.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

*Zhixiang Su,Di Wang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Pooling, a novel method to enhance GNN-based models for link prediction in KGs, achieving SOTA performance in most tested settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla aggregation in GNNs for KG link prediction lacks significant impact, prompting the need for improved methods like Context Pooling.

Method: Context Pooling applies graph pooling in KGs and generates query-specific graphs for inductive settings, using neighborhood precision and recall metrics to identify relevant neighbors.

Result: Applied to two SOTA models on three datasets, Context Pooling achieved SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: Context Pooling effectively enhances GNN-based link prediction in KGs, especially in inductive settings, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty propagation in credal networks, specifically chains, using belief and plausibility functions for robust and efficient inference.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robustness, highlighting its advantages and limitations for chains and broader credal networks.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical utility for belief inference in chains and credal networks, balancing computational speed and uncertainty representation.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer

The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief

*Fedor Rodionov,Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Michael Birsak,John Femiani,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA is a benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in LLMs, revealing their limitations in real-world layout reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' ability to reason about geometric and spatial properties in structured indoor scenes.

Method: PlanQA uses symbolic representations (e.g., JSON, XML) of indoor scenes and diverse question types to test metric, topological, and design reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform well on shallow queries but struggle with physical constraints, spatial coherence, and layout perturbations.

Conclusion: PlanQA highlights a blind spot in LLMs and encourages development of models better at spatial reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DPO is efficient for aligning language models with human preferences but has theoretical gaps. This paper analyzes DPO's dynamics, revealing sensitivity to initialization and misallocation of probability mass. A new bilevel optimization framework (stable preference optimization) is proposed to improve alignment and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address DPO's underexplored theoretical properties and limitations, such as sensitivity to initialization and misallocation of probability mass, which can reinforce bias and misalign models.

Method: A bilevel optimization framework integrating supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective, featuring a regularization scheme for absolute probability improvement and stable dynamics.

Result: The proposed method improves reasoning accuracy and aligns output distributions better than standard DPO, as shown in reasoning and summarization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Stable preference optimization offers a more reliable and interpretable approach to language model alignment, advancing the design of preference-based objectives.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [112] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced based on contour lines, using photogrammetry and geometric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively study the impact of size reduction on violins' contour lines, a feature observed by experts but not previously analyzed.

Method: Analyzes 25 violins via photogrammetry, extracts contour lines, fits them to parabolic curves, and uses classification methods to predict reduction.

Result: Classification is feasible, with the opening parameter (beta) being the most predictive, though challenges remain for partially transformed violins.

Conclusion: Geometry alone can predict size reduction to some extent, with beta as the key parameter, but further refinement is needed for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: The FAI Benchmark evaluates AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions, revealing gaps in current models, especially in faith, character, and purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift AI evaluation from technical capabilities or harm prevention to assessing how AI contributes to holistic human well-being.

Method: Uses 1,229 objective and subjective questions, specialized judge LLMs, and geometric mean scoring to evaluate 28 language models across seven flourishing dimensions.

Result: No model achieved acceptable alignment across all dimensions; highest score was 72/100, with weaknesses in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose.

Conclusion: The FAI Benchmark provides a framework for developing AI that actively supports human flourishing, with implications for AI ethics and evaluation.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts model for autonomous driving, mimicking human learning and reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization and interpretation in autonomous driving by leveraging human-like skill-by-skill learning and reasoning, addressing the limitations of general MoE models.

Method: Proposes MoSE with skill-oriented routing and hierarchical skill datasets, integrating auxiliary tasks in a single forward process without extra cost.

Result: Outperforms larger models (8B+ parameters) on CODA AD corner case reasoning with less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, reducing activated model size by at least 62.5%.

Conclusion: MoSE offers an efficient, human-inspired approach for autonomous driving, achieving superior performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for adaptive sensing in AI to reduce environmental and economic costs, improve efficiency, and enhance model performance, even with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI scaling methods are unsustainable and costly. Biological sensory systems inspire adaptive sensing as a solution.

Method: Proposes adaptive sensing to modulate sensor parameters dynamically, mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency.

Result: Small models with adaptive sensing outperform larger models trained with more data and compute.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a roadmap for integrating adaptive sensing, addressing challenges, and promoting sustainable, equitable AI.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

*Samuel Reyd,Ada Diaconescu,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap between classical XAI/causality explanations and non-expert user expectations by proposing polynomial-complexity algorithms to identify actual causes, applicable to diverse systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-expert users expect explanations as facts causing outcomes (actual causes), but formalizing and identifying these is challenging and NP-complete. Existing methods lack practicality.

Method: A set of algorithms with polynomial complexity and adjustable precision/exhaustiveness is proposed to identify actual causes in non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems.

Result: Experiments show the algorithms handle diverse systems (non-boolean, black-box, stochastic) and allow precision/exhaustiveness trade-offs with computation time.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms bridge the gap in practical causal explanations for non-experts, offering scalable solutions with flexibility in precision.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qing,Qing xu,Kaiwen Pan,Ting luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining prompt engineering and multidimensional knowledge graphs to enhance large language models' performance in legal dispute analysis, addressing limitations like insufficient legal knowledge and reasoning deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack sufficient legal knowledge representation, concept understanding, and reasoning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in legal dispute analysis.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure (task definition, knowledge background, reasoning guidance) and a three-layer knowledge graph (classification ontology, representation, instance layers). It employs four methods for legal concept retrieval and integrates web search.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application and nuanced understanding of judicial logic.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel approach for intelligent legal assistance systems, enhancing legal decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing

### [118] [Meek Models Shall Inherit the Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07931)
*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to convergence in AI model capabilities, making meek models competitive with top-tier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inequality in AI model performance due to compute scaling by a few companies, and exploring the potential for convergence in capabilities.

Method: Develops a model showing shrinking marginal returns to compute under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, supported by empirical data and theoretical performance models.

Result: Diminishing returns are strong enough that even exponential scaling provides little long-term advantage, making meek models competitive.

Conclusion: AI strategy and policy need reevaluation due to the rising competitiveness of meek models, impacting future AI development and governance.

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

### [119] [Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935)
*Kiran Tomlinson,Sonia Jaffe,Will Wang,Scott Counts,Siddharth Suri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how generative AI impacts work activities, identifying common tasks like information gathering and writing, and ranks occupations by AI applicability, with knowledge work and sales scoring highest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the economic effects of generative AI by examining its role in work activities and its success across occupations.

Method: Analysis of 200k anonymized conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, classifying activities and measuring task success and impact.

Result: Highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work and sales occupations; successful tasks include information provision and writing.

Conclusion: Generative AI is most applicable to knowledge-intensive and communication-heavy occupations, with implications for workforce adaptation.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

### [120] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cognitive biases in LLMs, attributing them mainly to pretraining rather than finetuning or randomness, using a two-step causal method involving cross-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of cognitive biases in LLMs and whether they stem from pretraining, finetuning, or random training noise.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) finetuning models with different random seeds to assess randomness impact, and (2) cross-tuning (swapping instruction datasets) to isolate bias sources.

Result: Biases are primarily shaped by pretraining; models with the same pretrained backbone show similar bias patterns, more so than those sharing finetuning data.

Conclusion: Pretraining is the dominant source of biases in LLMs, suggesting future bias mitigation strategies should focus on pretraining origins.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are tested for reliability in surveys, showing vulnerabilities to perturbations and recency bias, with larger models being more robust but still sensitive to semantic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and biases of LLMs when used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys.

Method: Tested nine LLMs on World Values Survey questions, applying 11 perturbations to phrasing and answer options, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: LLMs exhibit recency bias and sensitivity to semantic variations; larger models are more robust but still affected by combined perturbations.

Conclusion: Prompt design and robustness testing are crucial when using LLMs for synthetic survey data due to their biases and vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text across multiple dimensions, including utility, fairness, privacy risks, and expert feedback, with a focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for principled evaluations of synthetic text to ensure its viability and privacy-preservation in AI development.

Method: The toolkit allows users to evaluate synthetic data along multiple dimensions, including downstream utility, fairness, privacy risks, and expert feedback.

Result: SynthTextEval consolidates and standardizes evaluation metrics, improving the viability of synthetic text for privacy-preserving AI development.

Conclusion: The toolkit aims to enhance the use of synthetic text in high-stakes domains by providing comprehensive and standardized evaluations.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on patient and clinician perspectives, and presents the PatientSafetyBench for targeted safety assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of LLMs in medical applications raises safety concerns due to their potential impact on human health, yet prior evaluations lack domain-specific focus.

Method: Develops a tailored safety evaluation protocol, including the PatientSafetyBench with 466 samples across 5 categories, and applies red-teaming on the MediPhi model collection.

Result: Bridges the literature gap by defining safety criteria for medical LLMs from patient, clinician, and general user perspectives.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for safer deployment of medical LLMs through targeted safety evaluations.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores interruption detection in collaborative learning, focusing on single and multi-group dialogues, and proposes a robust method for identifying interruptions despite overlapping speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting interruptions in noisy, multi-group classroom settings, where overlapping speech complicates traditional methods.

Method: Analyzes interruption detection in single and multi-group dialogues, then develops a state-of-the-art method resilient to overlapping speech.

Result: A robust interruption identification method suitable for classroom deployment, with insights into linguistic and prosodic features of interruptions.

Conclusion: The work advances interruption detection in collaborative learning and sets a foundation for future research on multi-group dialogue tracking.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework improves counterspeech generation against health misinformation by optimizing knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement, outperforming baselines in quality and human preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based counterspeech methods lack sufficient evidence and control over outputs, necessitating a more robust and controlled approach.

Method: Proposes a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework using multiple LLMs for optimized knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement, integrating static and dynamic evidence.

Result: Outperforms baselines in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy; human evaluations confirm refinement enhances quality and preference.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality counterspeech, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel DL model combining GNNs and CNNs with real-time graph generation improves efficiency for long texts, outperforming Transformers in speed and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic complexity is inefficient for long texts; this study aims to address this by proposing a more efficient architecture.

Method: Integrates GNNs and CNNs with real-time graph generation, uses LLM inputs, and employs small-world graphs for document-level aggregation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in text classification tasks with structural graph properties (clustering coefficient ~0.45, shortest path 4-5).

Conclusion: The model is efficient and effective for long-text processing, offering a viable alternative to Transformers.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl improves AI-generated healthcare content by adjusting readability while preserving meaning, outperforming GPT-4 in accuracy and expert preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective human-AI communication in healthcare requires personalized and understandable content, which current models struggle with.

Method: MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework, adjusts output complexity without losing meaning.

Result: MedReadCtrl outperforms GPT-4 in readability and task performance, with experts preferring it, especially for low-literacy users.

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl offers a scalable solution for equitable AI-enabled healthcare by improving readability and preserving medical intent.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eviction is a critical but understudied SDoH, often missing in structured EHRs, limiting research and applications.

Method: Combines LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction data from clinical notes.

Result: Achieved high Macro-F1 scores (88.8% for eviction, 90.3% for other SDoH), outperforming GPT-4o and BioBERT, with 80% reduced annotation effort.

Conclusion: The pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and generalizable to other extraction tasks, advancing eviction-related SDoH research.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of compressing time series understanding into small, interpretable models for practical deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning

building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal

introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAND, a framework for LLM agents to deliberate over actions before committing, improving performance by 20% over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent tuning methods focus on imitating expert behaviors or preferences, potentially leading to suboptimal actions due to limited exploration.

Method: SAND uses self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided critique to deliberate over actions, then finetunes the agent with these trajectories.

Result: SAND achieves a 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAND enhances LLM agent performance by enabling explicit action deliberation, addressing limitations of existing tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

TL;DR: RLEP is a two-phase RL framework for language models that replays verified trajectories to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training RL for large language models is unstable and energy-intensive, with policies drifting from pretrained weights.

Method: RLEP collects verified trajectories and replays them during training, blending new rollouts with replayed successes.

Result: RLEP achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy on benchmarks (e.g., AIME-2024: 38.2% to 39.9%).

Conclusion: RLEP enhances RL training efficiency and performance, with open-sourced resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'machine bullshit' as a framework to study LLMs' indifference to truth, proposing the Bullshit Index and a taxonomy of four bullshit forms. Empirical results show RLHF worsens bullshit, and CoT prompting amplifies certain forms, with political contexts favoring weasel words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs by conceptualizing and quantifying 'machine bullshit' as a broader phenomenon.

Method: Proposes the Bullshit Index and a taxonomy of four bullshit forms. Evaluates using datasets like Marketplace, Political Neutrality, and BullshitEval (2,400 scenarios).

Result: RLHF exacerbates bullshit, CoT prompting amplifies empty rhetoric and paltering, and weasel words dominate in political contexts.

Conclusion: Highlights AI alignment challenges and offers insights for improving LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING improves smaller LLMs by distilling planning trajectories from larger models, boosting performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging planning structures from large LLMs to enhance smaller models' reasoning capabilities is underexplored.

Method: PLAN-TUNING distills synthetic task decompositions (planning trajectories) from large LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models using supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives.

Result: Plan-tuned models outperform baselines by ~7% on GSM8k and MATH, and show ~10-12% improvements on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING effectively enhances smaller LLMs' reasoning and generalization, making it a viable strategy for task-specific improvements.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeaR improves LLM reasoning by guiding models to discover optimal reasoning paths via data curation and reinforcement learning, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reasoning in LLMs by reducing over-reliance on complex code structures and focusing on core reasoning.

Method: TeaR uses data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in reasoning through code-related tasks.

Result: Significant improvements, e.g., 35.9% on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B across 17 benchmarks.

Conclusion: TeaR effectively enhances LLM reasoning by optimizing reasoning paths, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

*Hein Htet,Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim,Yutaka Sasaki,Ryoji Asahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study proposes using NER and RE with BERT variants (MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT) to extract ORR catalyst info from literature, achieving high accuracy and outperforming general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured ORR catalyst data from complex literature is challenging, necessitating automated methods for scalable analysis.

Method: Uses DyGIE++ with domain-specific BERT models (MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT) for NER and RE, fine-tuned on a manually annotated dataset.

Result: PubMedBERT achieves 82.19% NER F1-score; MatSciBERT attains 66.10% RE F1-score, outperforming general models like BlueBERT.

Conclusion: Domain-specific BERT models are reliable for automated ORR catalyst extraction, offering scalable literature analysis.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs have limitations in handling complex computational and agentic tasks, including verifying accuracy beyond certain complexity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the boundaries of LLM capabilities, especially regarding hallucinations and autonomous task performance.

Method: Analyzed the computational complexity of LLM inference and tested tasks beyond certain complexity thresholds.

Result: LLMs cannot perform or verify tasks exceeding specific complexity limits.

Conclusion: This highlights inherent limitations in LLMs for complex or autonomous applications, with implications for real-world use.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

*Yuanchen Shi,Longyin Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for generating and refining psychological counseling dialogues in Chinese, using large language models, resulting in the CPsDD dataset and CADSS system, which excels in strategy prediction and emotional support tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of psychological support datasets, especially in non-English languages, by leveraging limited real-world data and expert knowledge.

Method: Fine-tune two models (Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier) to create and refine dialogues, forming the CPsDD dataset. Develop CADSS, a system with components for profiling, summarizing, planning, and supporting.

Result: CPsDD contains 68K dialogues across diverse categories. CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance in strategy prediction and emotional support tasks on CPsDD and ESConv datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and system effectively address the lack of psychological support datasets and demonstrate superior performance in relevant tasks.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

TL;DR: Extends voice activity projection (VAP) to triadic conversations, showing improved performance over dyadic baselines, with conversation type affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in turn-taking research by applying VAP to triadic multi-party scenarios, beyond conventional dyadic settings.

Method: Trained multiple VAP models on a Japanese triadic dataset with varied discussion topics, focusing on predicting future voice activity using acoustic data.

Result: Triadic VAP models outperformed dyadic baselines, though accuracy varied with conversation type.

Conclusion: VAP is viable for triadic turn-taking; future work will integrate it into spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

TL;DR: LLMs with few-shot prompting outperform fine-tuned SLMs in multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top rankings in CheckThat! 2025, especially in noisy or low-quality data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs with few-shot prompting for multilingual subjectivity detection, particularly in scenarios with scarce or inconsistent labeled data.

Method: Used large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting, experimenting with advanced techniques like debating LLMs and example selection strategies.

Result: Achieved top rankings in CheckThat! 2025, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning is effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a robust alternative to traditional fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in Arabic-English domain-specific settings, revealing retrieval as a bottleneck and proposing a solution to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in prior work, which focused on generation and overlooked retrieval challenges in cross-lingual RAG, especially in domain-specific scenarios.

Method: Analyzed Arabic-English RAG using real-world corporate datasets, systematically studying multilingual retrieval behavior with varied query-document language combinations.

Result: Retrieval is a critical bottleneck, with performance drops when query and document languages differ, primarily due to ranking difficulties across languages.

Conclusion: A simple retrieval strategy enforcing equal retrieval from both languages significantly improves cross-lingual performance, highlighting opportunities for better multilingual retrieval in real-world RAG.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the roles of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs, finding SFT improves complex reasoning but harms simpler tasks, while RL enhances generalization. Combining them fails to yield additive benefits, revealing a "synergy dilemma."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how long-CoT SFT and RL interact in VLMs and their joint effectiveness for multimodal reasoning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of long-CoT SFT and RL across multimodal benchmarks, testing various training strategies and combinations.

Result: SFT aids complex reasoning but causes verbosity and underperformance on simple tasks. RL improves generalization and brevity. Combining them leads to trade-offs without additive benefits.

Conclusion: The "synergy dilemma" calls for adaptive approaches to better integrate SFT and RL in VLMs for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

TL;DR: M4Doc introduces a single-to-mix modality alignment framework using MLLMs to improve DIMT by aligning an image-only encoder with multimodal representations, enhancing translation quality and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing generalization challenges in DIMT due to limited training data and complex visual-textual interactions.

Method: Aligns an image-only encoder with MLLM's multimodal representations, leveraging pre-trained knowledge for lightweight DIMT training.

Result: Significant improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: M4Doc effectively enhances DIMT performance by leveraging MLLM knowledge while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers a Bayesian foundation in discrete-diffusion language models, showing that denoiser outputs under forward masking align with the posterior over clean tokens. It introduces a lightweight ensemble method for improved performance and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete-diffusion models and Bayesian principles, enabling better performance and uncertainty quantification without additional training.

Method: Monte Carlo marginalization over K corruptions to approximate the posterior, combined with an inference-time ensemble averaging K mask-and-denoise passes.

Result: Achieves test perplexity of 8.8 on WikiText-2 with K=8, outperforming GPT-2 Small (20.3) with comparable model size.

Conclusion: The method provides a consistent, efficient way to leverage Bayesian principles in discrete-diffusion models, enhancing performance and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are computationally demanding, but Knowledge Distillation (KD) can compress them while retaining strong QA performance. Student models achieve over 90% of teacher performance with up to 57.1% fewer parameters, especially with one-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of LLMs in resource-constrained environments by exploring KD for compression without significant performance loss.

Method: Evaluate student models (from Pythia and Qwen2.5 families) on QA benchmarks (SQuAD, MLQA) using zero-shot and one-shot prompting.

Result: Student models retain >90% of teacher performance with up to 57.1% fewer parameters; one-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot.

Conclusion: KD with minimal prompting can create efficient, high-performing QA systems for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large-scale fine-tuning in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for complex QA tasks, showing improved prompts and frugality-focused fine-tuning can achieve competitive results with fewer searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked efficiency metric (number of retrieval searches) in RAG systems, while maintaining accuracy and recall.

Method: Uses a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts and explores supervised/RL-based fine-tuning for frugality.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like HotPotQA without large-scale fine-tuning and reduces search costs by half.

Conclusion: Efficiency in RAG can be improved without extensive fine-tuning, highlighting the value of frugality and optimized prompts.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) in Chinese content moderation, presents a dataset of 500 real-world examples, benchmarks LLMs, and proposes a Pinyin-based solution to improve detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCR is a growing challenge in Chinese content moderation, but existing evaluations lack real-world creativity. The study aims to provide a realistic benchmark and solution.

Method: Organizes PCR into a taxonomy, compiles a dataset of 500 real posts, benchmarks LLMs, and tests a Pinyin-based prompting strategy.

Result: Best model achieves F1-score of 0.672; Pinyin-based prompting recovers lost accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a taxonomy, benchmark, and lightweight mitigation technique for robust toxicity detection.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOIR is a new metric for evaluating summarization quality by balancing semantic retention and compression, correlating well with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an automated, objective measure of summarization quality without relying on human-generated references.

Method: Uses a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity and evaluates the tradeoff between summary length and semantic retention.

Result: NOIR effectively captures the summarization tradeoff and aligns with human perception of quality.

Conclusion: NOIR offers a scalable, automated tool for assessing and improving summarization tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS), a method to enhance Transformer performance by simulating more attention heads and larger hidden dimensions without increasing parameters, alongside Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) for cost control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation that increasing attention heads and hidden size improves performance, but with parameter overhead, motivates a solution to simulate these increases efficiently.

Method: SAS projects low-dimensional head representations into higher-dimensional spaces to mimic larger models, while PEAA controls parameter costs.

Result: Experiments show SAS outperforms other attention variants across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: SAS and PEAA offer a parameter-efficient way to boost Transformer performance by simulating larger models.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the resource-intensive fine-tuning of LLMs and scalability/accuracy limitations of naive RAG implementations.

Method: Integrates dense/sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and summarization; includes preprocessing for efficiency.

Result: Achieved 0.57 mean answer similarity and 0.82 Q3 similarity; 93% faster training and 40% faster execution.

Conclusion: K2RAG improves accuracy, efficiency, and scalability over traditional RAG methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

### [150] [Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700)
*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper verifies and extends Vec2Text's ability to reconstruct original texts from embeddings, confirming its effectiveness but highlighting privacy risks and potential defenses like quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate Vec2Text's claims about reconstructing texts from embeddings and explore its implications for privacy in NLP tasks.

Method: Reproduced Vec2Text, validated original claims, and conducted additional experiments (parameter sensitivity, reconstruction of sensitive inputs, and embedding quantization).

Result: Vec2Text effectively reconstructs texts, including sensitive inputs like passwords, but is sensitive to input length. Quantization and noise mitigate privacy risks.

Conclusion: Text embeddings pose privacy risks; defenses like quantization are needed, and further research on robust NLP defenses is crucial.

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

*Zhijin Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective-DPO, a method for post-training alignment of LLMs by prioritizing high-impact tokens using token-level log-probability differences, reducing computational costs and improving alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs is challenging due to unequal token contributions. The goal is to enhance alignment efficiency by focusing on informative tokens.

Method: Selective-DPO leverages token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model to prioritize high-impact tokens.

Result: Experiments on Arena-Hard and MT-Bench show Selective-DPO outperforms standard DPO and distillation-based methods, with stronger reference models further improving performance.

Conclusion: Token-level optimization and reference model quality are crucial for effective preference alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper reviews LLMs in the legal domain, introducing a dual-lens taxonomy to unify research and breakthroughs. It highlights LLMs' capabilities and challenges, proposing a roadmap for future legal AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically unify and review the application of LLMs in law, addressing gaps in legal reasoning and professional ontologies.

Method: Uses a dual-lens taxonomy integrating legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies, with innovations like sparse attention and mixture-of-experts architectures.

Result: Documents progress in task generalization, reasoning, and workflow integration, but notes challenges like hallucination and ethical asymmetry.

Conclusion: Proposes a taxonomy for legal NLP tasks and identifies future frontiers, providing a roadmap for legal AI development.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

### [154] [StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803)
*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni proposes a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) with speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to tackle streaming speech translation (StreamST) by integrating segmentation, policy decisions, and translation without extensive policy-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing StreamST methods rely on sentence-level segments, limiting context and complicating policy learning due to speech complexity and cross-lingual generation.

Method: StreamUni uses a unified LSLM with speech CoT to generate multi-stage outputs, enabling simultaneous segmentation, policy decisions, and translation. A streaming CoT training method enhances low-latency capabilities.

Result: Experiments show StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art performance in StreamST tasks.

Conclusion: StreamUni effectively addresses StreamST challenges by unifying segmentation, policy, and translation in a single model, improving latency and quality.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

### [155] [Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808)
*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae, enabling continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of logic formulae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning by ensuring semantically consistent embeddings of logic formulae, which must be invertible for practical use.

Method: A Transformer-based decoder-only model is trained to invert semantic embeddings of STL formulae, using a small vocabulary derived from STL syntax.

Result: The model generates valid formulae after 1 epoch, generalizes to STL semantics in about 10 epochs, and produces simpler yet semantically close formulae.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures semantic information in embeddings, generalizes well, and performs successfully in a requirement mining task for STL specifications.

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

TL;DR: The paper explores how repetition neurons in LLMs affect in-context learning (ICL) performance, showing their impact varies by layer depth and comparing them to induction heads for reducing repetitive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of repetition neurons in LLMs' ICL performance, diverging from prior focus on attention heads.

Method: Examined repetition neurons' effects across different layer depths and compared them with induction heads.

Result: Impact of repetition neurons on ICL varies by layer depth; strategies to reduce repetitive outputs without harming ICL were identified.

Conclusion: Repetition neurons influence ICL performance layer-dependently, offering insights for optimizing LLMs to balance repetition and learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

### [157] [On the Effect of Instruction Tuning Loss on Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07817)
*Anwoy Chatterjee,H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala,Sumit Bhatia,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as an improved alternative to conventional instruction tuning by differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in the loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional auto-regressive objective in instruction tuning may not be optimal, as it ignores prompt tokens in loss computation. This work investigates the impact of weighting prompt and response tokens differently.

Method: The authors systematically study the effect of weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss and introduce WIT. Experiments involve five language models, three datasets, and five benchmarks.

Result: Standard instruction tuning often underperforms. Optimal performance is achieved with low-to-moderate prompt token weight and moderate-to-high response token weight, improving robustness and serving as better starting points for preference alignment.

Conclusion: The findings suggest re-evaluating instruction tuning loss functions and provide insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. The code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

*Gianluca Vico,Jindřinch Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces conditional unigram tokenization, a method to improve cross-lingual semantic alignment by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens. While it shows no gains in machine translation, it reduces perplexity in language modeling, suggesting data efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-lingual semantic alignment in tokenization by leveraging parallel data, addressing limitations of standard unigram tokenization.

Method: Conditional unigram tokenization, where target token probabilities are conditioned on source-language tokens from parallel data. Evaluated on four language pairs for intrinsic properties and downstream tasks like machine translation and language modeling.

Result: No improvement in machine translation quality but consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling. Data efficiency issues due to quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation.

Conclusion: Alternative parameterizations may be needed for practical cross-lingual tokenization, as the current method faces scalability challenges.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how coreferential complexity in retrieved documents impacts RAG systems, showing that coreference resolution improves retrieval and QA performance, especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity caused by coreferential complexity in RAG systems, which disrupts in-context learning and factual consistency.

Method: Systematic investigation of entity coreference effects on retrieval and generative performance, including comparative analysis of pooling strategies and QA tasks.

Result: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval and QA performance; mean pooling excels in context capture, and smaller models benefit more from disambiguation.

Conclusion: The study highlights coreferential complexity challenges in RAG and offers insights for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: DocCHA is a confidence-aware, modular framework for clinical reasoning, outperforming LLM baselines in diagnostic accuracy and symptom recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CHAs lack adaptive reasoning and transparency, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: DocCHA decomposes diagnosis into symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction, using confidence scores for adaptive questioning.

Result: DocCHA achieves 5.18% higher accuracy and 30% better symptom recall than LLM baselines.

Conclusion: DocCHA enables structured, transparent, and efficient clinical conversations, advancing trustworthy LLM-powered assistants.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preparing high-quality MD input files is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating automation.

Method: Integration of LLMs (Gemini 2.0), Python scripting, and Selenium automates CHARMM GUI navigation, parameter extraction, and NAMD input file generation.

Result: The pipeline reduces setup time, minimizes errors, and scales for parallel processing of multiple protein systems.

Conclusion: This framework enhances MD simulation efficiency and demonstrates LLMs' potential in computational structural biology.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for

TL;DR: SAGE is a VLM-based framework improving industrial anomaly detection by integrating domain-specific knowledge and optimizing outputs with expert preferences, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with interpretable explanations and generalization in industrial anomaly detection due to domain-specific challenges.

Method: SAGE uses Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) for domain-specific reasoning and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO) for aligning outputs with expert preferences. It also introduces AD-PL, a dataset for anomaly reasoning.

Result: SAGE shows superior performance in zero-shot and one-shot settings on industrial anomaly datasets.

Conclusion: SAGE addresses key limitations of VLMs in industrial anomaly detection, offering improved interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

Method: MIRIX introduces six memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, Knowledge Vault) and a multi-agent framework for dynamic control. It is validated on multimodal (ScreenshotVQA) and textual (LOCOMO) benchmarks.

Result: MIRIX outperforms baselines with 35% higher accuracy on ScreenshotVQA and 85.4% on LOCOMO, while reducing storage by 99.9%.

Conclusion: MIRIX sets a new standard for memory-augmented AI agents, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [166] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why implicit reward models (IM-RMs) generalize worse than explicit reward models (EX-RMs), finding that IM-RMs rely more on superficial token-level cues, leading to poorer performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalization gap between IM-RMs and EX-RMs, despite their near-identical training setups, and identify the root cause of IM-RMs' weaker performance.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis and experiments to compare IM-RMs and EX-RMs, focusing on their reliance on token-level cues and performance under distribution shifts.

Result: IM-RMs generalize worse due to their dependence on superficial token-level cues, even in-distribution, and the study disproves alternative hypotheses like the verifier-generator claim.

Conclusion: Minor design choices in reward models significantly impact generalization, with IM-RMs' reliance on token-level cues being a key limitation.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) outperform larger models in clinical decision-making for rheumatology, offering energy efficiency and local deployment, but still require expert oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of language models in clinical decision-making, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings.

Method: Combined smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and evaluated their performance in rheumatology.

Result: SLMs with RAG achieved higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, with lower energy costs and local deployment feasibility.

Conclusion: While SLMs with RAG are promising for clinical support, expert oversight is necessary due to their inability to consistently match specialist-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

TL;DR: MedThink-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, featuring 500 expert-annotated questions. The LLM-w-Ref framework assesses reasoning with expert fidelity, showing smaller models can outperform larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning lack rigor and scalability, necessitating a transparent and trustworthy benchmark.

Method: MedThink-Bench includes 500 questions with expert rationales. LLM-w-Ref uses fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge for scalable, expert-level assessment.

Result: LLM-w-Ref correlates strongly with expert judgments, and smaller models like MedGemma-27B outperform larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench provides a scalable, rigorous tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, promoting safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: PyVision is a framework enabling MLLMs to autonomously generate and refine Python-based tools for visual reasoning, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches in visual reasoning are limited by static toolsets and predefined workflows, restricting flexibility and interpretability.

Method: PyVision is an interactive, multi-turn framework that allows MLLMs to dynamically create, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to specific tasks.

Result: PyVision boosts performance significantly, e.g., +7.8% for GPT-4.1 on V* and +31.1% for Claude-4.0-Sonnet on VLMsAreBlind-mini.

Conclusion: Dynamic tooling enables models to invent tools, advancing agentic visual reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

### [170] [Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313)
*Alan Malek,Jiawei Ge,Nevena Lazic,Chi Jin,András György,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how advanced LLMs fail on simple reasoning tasks despite excelling in complex ones, revealing systematic failure patterns and highlighting issues with out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with tasks that are easy for humans, despite their success in complex benchmarks.

Method: Created a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks and introduced the 'unpuzzles' dataset, testing LLMs on trivialized versions of well-known puzzles.

Result: LLMs consistently failed on simple tasks due to statistical shortcuts, intermediate errors, and long-context processing issues, even excelling at harder versions of the same logic.

Conclusion: Out-of-distribution generalization remains a challenge for LLMs, and simplifying tasks does not guarantee better performance.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

### [171] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constructive approach to scaling LLMs using fixed embeddings, enabling modular composition and layer-wise growth, improving efficiency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive and inflexible nature of monolithic LLM training by exploring alternative, scalable methods.

Method: Uses non-trainable embeddings for modular composition (merging specialist models via logit averaging) and progressive layer-wise growth (stacking layers incrementally).

Result: Merged models outperform experts on benchmarks like MMLU, and layer-wise growth shows stable convergence and depth-correlated reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Suggests a shift towards incremental, modular AI development for resource efficiency, continual learning, and democratized AI ecosystem.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FACap, a large-scale fashion-domain dataset for composed image retrieval (CIR), and FashionBLIP-2, a fine-tuned model that improves performance in fashion CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods struggle with fashion domains due to complex vocabulary and lack of annotated datasets.

Method: FACap is created using web-sourced images and a two-stage annotation pipeline with VLM and LLM. FashionBLIP-2 fine-tunes BLIP-2 with adapters and multi-head matching.

Result: FashionBLIP-2 with FACap pretraining significantly improves performance on fashion CIR tasks, especially for fine-grained texts.

Conclusion: The approach addresses fashion CIR challenges effectively, demonstrating value for e-commerce applications.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning (MU) is a cost-effective way to remove undesired information from diffusion models, but proving complete removal is challenging. autoeval-dmun, an automated tool, uses vision-language models to assess unlearning and identify nearby concepts at risk of damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of proving complete information removal and potential performance damage in diffusion models during unlearning.

Method: Introduces autoeval-dmun, leveraging vision-language models to extract structured knowledge, identify nearby concepts at risk, and test unlearning robustness with adversarial prompts.

Result: Language models provide semantic orderings correlating with unlearning damage and can circumvent unlearning using adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun effectively evaluates unlearning in diffusion models, highlighting the role of language models in assessing and testing unlearning robustness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP combines GNN node encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths to improve link prediction by capturing multi-hop dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with link-specific structural patterns due to node-centric message-passing, and existing methods are either costly or simplistic.

Method: SP4LP uses GNN for node encodings, extracts shortest paths between node pairs, and processes them with a sequence model.

Result: SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: SP4LP is more expressive than standard GNNs and structural feature methods, offering a general solution for link prediction.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse adapters as modular architecture building blocks, outperforming LoRA and full fine-tuning, and studies their merging properties across 20 NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate sparse adapters as efficient, modular alternatives to LoRA for task adaptation without fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a simple training method for sparse adapters and evaluates their merging properties across multiple NLP tasks.

Result: Sparse adapters outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in-distribution post-merging but struggle with held-out performance.

Conclusion: Sparse adapters are effective modular components but face challenges in generalizing to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Str-GCL integrates structural commonsense into Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) using first-order logic rules, improving representation learning without altering the graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCL methods overlook structural commonsense in graphs, missing crucial knowledge for effective representation learning.

Method: Str-GCL uses first-order logic rules for structural commonsense, integrating them via topological and attribute-based rules and a representation alignment mechanism.

Result: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, demonstrating the value of structural commonsense in graph representation learning.

Conclusion: Str-GCL successfully incorporates structural commonsense into GCL, offering a new approach for enhanced graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using scientific machine learning (UDEs) for malware propagation modeling, outperforming traditional and neural methods by 44% in prediction error while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of malware propagation is crucial for cybersecurity defenses, especially against adaptive threats. Existing methods often miss nonlinear feedback mechanisms in real-world networks.

Method: The study evaluates three approaches: classical ODEs, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs, using data from the Code Red worm outbreak. A symbolic recovery method is introduced to transform neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions.

Result: UDEs reduce prediction error by 44% compared to baselines, revealing suppression mechanisms like network saturation, security response, and malware evolution.

Conclusion: Hybrid physics-informed models (like UDEs) outperform purely analytical or neural methods, offering better accuracy and insights for early warning systems and targeted cyber defenses.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

TL;DR: CCQ is a novel quantization method compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss, enabling efficient single-GPU deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and deployment barriers due to LLM scaling, with sub-3-bit methods suffering accuracy and efficiency issues.

Method: CCQ combines hardware-aware bit-shift encoding, Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster for efficient low-bit quantization.

Result: CCQ compresses models like DeepSeek-V3 and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B significantly, enabling single-GPU deployment and open-sourcing.

Conclusion: CCQ effectively addresses accuracy-speed trade-offs in low-bit quantization, making large models more deployable.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

TL;DR: G-Guard, an attention-aware GNN-based classifier, defends against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs by constructing entity graphs and using attention-aware augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which are harder to detect than single-turn attacks.

Method: G-Guard uses entity graphs to capture harmful keyword relationships and an attention-aware augmentation mechanism to enhance classification.

Result: G-Guard outperforms all baselines in evaluations across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard effectively mitigates multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

*Sua Lee,Kyubum Shin,Jung Ho Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeMul, a description-free multi-prompt learning method, directly distills LLM knowledge into prompts, outperforming existing methods on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on unreliable text-based responses from LLMs for prompts, leading to variability and low reliability.

Method: Proposes DeMul, which skips description extraction and directly distills LLM knowledge into continuous vector prompts, enabling richer semantics and optimization.

Result: Superior performance across 11 recognition datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt weighting in multi-prompt settings.

Conclusion: DeMul offers a robust, description-free approach for leveraging LLMs in VLM prompt learning, eliminating the need for discrete templates.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGFM enhances flow matching for time series forecasting by learning from auxiliary model errors, improving prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of diffusion models in forecasting by leveraging flow matching's flexibility and untapped potential.

Method: Extends flow matching with auxiliary model outputs, constructs conditional probability paths, and uses affine paths.

Result: CGFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: CGFM effectively advances forecasting methods by integrating error learning and flexible probability paths.

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

*Elia Piccoli,Malio Li,Giacomo Carfì,Vincenzo Lomonaco,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a method to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models for Reinforcement Learning (RL), balancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained models offer rich latent embeddings, but RL lacks efficient ways to leverage them. The goal is to enhance RL state representation by combining multiple pre-trained models.

Method: Introduces WSA, an architecture to merge embeddings from multiple pre-trained models, tested on Atari games. Evaluates performance and generalization with varying numbers of models.

Result: WSA achieves performance comparable to end-to-end models on Atari games. Scaling the number of models impacts agent performance during and after training.

Conclusion: WSA effectively combines pre-trained model embeddings for RL, offering a balance between efficiency and performance, with potential for generalization.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

### [183] [Scale leads to compositional generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07207)
*Florian Redhardt,Yassir Akram,Simon Schug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can generalize over compositional tasks with sufficient data and model scaling, and their hidden activations can linearly decode task constituents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if neural networks can systematically capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous nature.

Method: Scaling data and model size, testing across task encodings, and analyzing hidden activations.

Result: Neural networks generalize compositionally with sufficient coverage, and task constituents can be linearly decoded from activations.

Conclusion: Compositional generalization is achievable with scaling, and hidden activations reveal task structure, correlating with model failures.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

*Yunyi Li,Maria De-Arteaga,Maytal Saar-Tsechansky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a machine learning framework to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, particularly in hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label bias causes systematic errors in datasets, posing a significant challenge in data integrity, especially in critical domains like hate speech detection. Existing methods to address this issue are limited.

Method: The authors propose DeCoLe, a principled framework for bias-aware mislabeling detection, theoretically justifying its effectiveness.

Result: DeCoLe outperforms alternative methods in detecting label errors, demonstrating its efficacy in bias-aware mislabeling detection.

Conclusion: DeCoLe addresses label bias challenges and can enhance data reliability in organizational systems.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

*Minchan Jeong,J. Jon Ryu,Se-Young Yun,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator is proposed, avoiding unstable operations like SVD and matrix inversion, and showing effectiveness in tasks like eigen-analysis and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like VAMPnet and DPNet for learning Koopman operator singular subspaces involve unstable operations (e.g., SVD, matrix inversion), leading to biased gradients and scalability issues.

Method: The proposed method uses low-rank approximation to learn the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator, avoiding unstable operations and integrating with deep learning pipelines.

Result: Empirical results show the learned singular subspaces are reliable and effective for tasks like eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and stable alternative for learning Koopman operator singular functions, improving performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

*Maya Kruse,Majid Afshar,Saksham Khatwani,Anoop Mayampurath,Guanhua Chen,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSE improves LLM uncertainty quantification by aggregating diverse model outputs using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, outperforming single-model and naive ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show inconsistent behavior, necessitating better uncertainty quantification, especially in high-stakes scenarios. Model diversity is underutilized in prior work.

Method: Proposes MUSE, which uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Experiments show MUSE enhances calibration and predictive performance in binary tasks.

Conclusion: MUSE effectively leverages model diversity for reliable uncertainty estimates, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

*Erfan Hamdi,Emma Lejeune*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a challenging dataset for benchmarking ML methods in fracture modeling, evaluates baseline models (PINN, FNO, UNet), and highlights their promise and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in ML studies relying on overly simple benchmarks for fracture modeling, the paper aims to provide a standardized, complex dataset reflecting real-world fracture processes.

Method: The authors create a dataset with 6,000 PFM simulations, including varied energy decompositions, boundary conditions, and crack configurations. They evaluate PINN, FNO, and UNet models, and explore ensembling strategies.

Result: The results show the promise and limitations of current ML models in fracture mechanics, demonstrating the dataset's utility as a benchmark.

Conclusion: The dataset and baseline models provide a standardized testbed for advancing ML in fracture mechanics, highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 training, evaluating energy efficiency and hardware demands. Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA are identified as the most energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of rigorous evaluation on energy usage and hardware demands of efficient attention variants in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Benchmark eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 training, measuring training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption.

Result: Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA are the most energy-efficient. Lower GPU power alone doesn't ensure reduced energy use; training time is equally critical.

Conclusion: Energy-aware benchmarking is crucial for attention design, and optimized kernels like Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA offer practical efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

*Giulio Rossolini,Fabio Brau,Alessandro Biondi,Battista Biggio,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a security risk in partitioned deep learning models where intercepted intermediate features can be exploited to craft transferable adversarial attacks, even in black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed nature of deep learning models in IoT environments exposes them to new vulnerabilities, particularly through intermediate feature interception.

Method: Proposes an exploitation strategy involving reconstructing tensor shapes from intercepted features and adapting surrogate models for effective adversarial attack transferability.

Result: Surrogate models trained with intercepted features significantly improve adversarial attack transferability, demonstrating the vulnerability.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to address intermediate feature leakage in secure distributed deep learning system designs.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining wearable IMU and contactless radar data improves food intake gesture detection, with a proposed robust multimodal framework (MM-TCN-CMA) handling missing modalities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dietary monitoring by improving gesture detection accuracy and robustness, especially when one sensing modality is unavailable.

Method: Proposes MM-TCN-CMA, a multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention, integrating IMU and radar data. Tests on a new dataset of 52 meal sessions.

Result: Improves F1-score by 4.3% (Radar) and 5.2% (IMU) over unimodal models. Maintains performance gains (1.3%-2.4%) even with missing modalities.

Conclusion: First robust multimodal framework for food intake gesture detection, demonstrating effective fusion of IMU and radar data.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

*Julianna Piskorz,Krzysztof Kacprzyk,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for modeling treatment effect trajectories over dose and time, addressing limitations of the static ATE metric. It adapts SemanticODE for interpretable, robust, and verifiable causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static ATE metric often fails to capture nuanced treatment dynamics in healthcare, necessitating a more detailed approach.

Method: The framework models treatment effects as smooth surfaces over dose and time, using SemanticODE for interpretability and robustness.

Result: The method provides accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, supporting clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances causal analysis by capturing dynamic treatment effects, enabling practical and transparent insights.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

*Aaron Foote,Danny Krizanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIP, a test to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores in machine learning models, especially when features are dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding feature importance is crucial for interpreting machine learning models, but permutation feature importance can be misleading with dependent features.

Method: The authors develop TRIP, a test requiring minimal assumptions, to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores due to model extrapolation. They also adapt it for high-dimensional settings.

Result: Testing on simulated data and applications confirms TRIP's reliability in detecting unreliable permutation feature importance scores.

Conclusion: TRIP provides a reliable method to assess the validity of permutation feature importance, enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

TL;DR: ProbNES, a new class of algorithms combining NES with Bayesian quadrature, outperforms traditional NES and global methods like BO in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NES algorithms are effective but suffer from limited sample efficiency due to random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates.

Method: Introduces ProbNES, enhancing NES with Bayesian quadrature for improved efficiency.

Result: ProbNES consistently outperforms non-probabilistic NES and global methods like BO in benchmark and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: ProbNES offers a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional NES and global optimisation methods.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

TL;DR: A framework using Mixture of VAEs and Riemannian geometry addresses intrinsic dimension estimation, local coordinate construction, and manifold learning, improving inverse problem solutions and model capacity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, but leveraging this requires solving tasks like intrinsic dimension estimation and manifold parameterization.

Method: Uses a Mixture of VAEs and Riemannian geometry to estimate intrinsic dimension via VAE decoder pullback metric, constructs local charts, and learns manifold mappings.

Result: Enhances solutions to ill-posed inverse problems (e.g., biomedical imaging) and shows intrinsic dimension as a proxy for model capacity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses manifold learning challenges, improving inference and reconstruction quality while monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Conclusion: The model effectively combines theoretical and practical operator learning, demonstrating enhanced performance in multifidelity settings.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

*Md Abrar Jahin,Taufikur Rahman Fuad,M. F. Mridha,Nafiz Fahad,Md. Jakir Hossen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdeptHEQ-FL is a hybrid classical-quantum FL framework addressing performance, privacy, and efficiency in non-IID environments. It combines CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive aggregation, selective HE, and dynamic freezing, improving accuracy and reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing model performance, privacy, and communication efficiency in FL, especially in non-IID settings, is challenging. Existing methods often compromise privacy, incur high costs, or ignore quantum enhancements.

Method: AdeptHEQ-FL integrates a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation with differential privacy, selective HE for secure aggregation, and dynamic layer-wise freezing to minimize overhead.

Result: AdeptHEQ-FL improves accuracy by ≈25.43% and ≈14.17% over Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN on CIFAR-10, while reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient solution for FL, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Shiwen Mao,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A secure and efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design is proposed, optimizing resource allocation and user scheduling with differential privacy. A novel DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence and rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in CFL like heterogeneous BS capabilities, non-IID user data, and limited resources, while ensuring privacy and efficiency.

Method: Joint optimization of RB allocation, user scheduling, and DP noise using a dynamic penalty function-assisted MARL algorithm (DPVD-MARL).

Result: DPVD-MARL improves convergence rate by 20% and rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The proposed DPVD-MARL effectively optimizes CFL performance, balancing privacy, efficiency, and convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cGAN-based framework is proposed to craft stealthy adversarial attacks on UAV IDS, countered by a CVAE detector outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS and OOD detectors fail against novel and stealthy adversarial attacks, necessitating advanced solutions.

Method: Develop a cGAN to generate adversarial samples evading IDS, and a CVAE to detect these stealthy attacks using negative log-likelihood.

Result: CVAE-based detection outperforms traditional methods, highlighting its effectiveness against generative-model-based intrusions.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling like CVAE is crucial for robust IDS against adaptive cyber threats.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Yuchen Liu,H. Vincent Poor,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deceptive signal-assisted private split learning model to protect data and model information from eavesdroppers, using a reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent eavesdroppers from collecting sensitive model and data information during collaborative training among edge devices.

Method: A soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) is used to optimize device subsets for deceptive signals and model training.

Result: The method improves convergence rate by 3x and reduces information leakage by 13% compared to traditional SAC.

Conclusion: The proposed ICM-CA framework effectively enhances privacy and training efficiency in split learning scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the plausibility-validity gap in LLMs for chemistry by fine-tuning the Magistral Small model with LoRA and a dual-domain dataset, improving chemical validity and synthesis feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between plausible but invalid outputs of LLMs in specialized domains like chemistry.

Method: Fine-tuned the Magistral Small model using LoRA and a dual-domain dataset of molecular properties and chemical reactions.

Result: Improved format adherence, chemical validity, and synthesis feasibility, though limitations like stereochemistry errors persist.

Conclusion: The framework adapts generalist LLMs for reliable chemical research, identifying areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: A lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer is added to graph transformers to route nodes to suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic), improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph transformers embed nodes in a single Euclidean space, which may not capture heterogeneous topologies effectively.

Method: Prepends a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer to project nodes onto suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) based on local structure.

Result: Improves node-classification accuracy by up to 3% on benchmarks and enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware projection sharpens predictive power and makes graph representations more interpretable.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) and context sample enhancement (CSE) to improve generalization in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) when training on a single context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL policies often fail to generalize to environments with different parameters, and obtaining diverse training data is impractical. The work addresses this by leveraging regularity in context parameters.

Method: The authors propose CEBE for better generalization and derive CSE as a data augmentation method to approximate CEBE in deterministic control environments.

Result: Analytical and empirical proofs show CEBE approximates the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. Numerical validation demonstrates CSE's effectiveness in improving generalization.

Conclusion: CEBE and CSE offer practical solutions to enhance DRL generalization, validated in simulations.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the statistical complexity of PU learning without assuming a known class prior, providing sample size bounds for positive and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning is common in real-world applications, but existing work relies on restrictive assumptions like known class priors or specific data distributions. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PU learning under varied setups, focusing on unknown class priors. Upper and lower bounds on sample sizes for positive and unlabeled data are derived.

Result: The paper proves bounds on the required sample sizes for PU learning without assuming a known class prior.

Conclusion: The study advances PU learning by relaxing restrictive assumptions and providing theoretical guarantees for broader applicability.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

*Zheyu Zhang,Jiayuan Dong,Jie Liu,Xun Huan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GO-CBED is a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for efficient causal experimental design, focusing on user-specified causal quantities rather than full model inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods aim to infer full causal models, which may be inefficient. GO-CBED targets specific causal queries for more focused experimentation.

Method: The framework uses a variational lower bound estimator, optimized via a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors, enabling real-time decisions.

Result: GO-CBED outperforms existing baselines in causal reasoning and discovery tasks, especially with limited budgets and complex mechanisms.

Conclusion: Aligning experimental design with specific goals and forward-looking planning improves efficiency and effectiveness in causal research.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATHENA, a hierarchical graph neural network framework for personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis, integrating clinical and molecular data to improve classification performance and patient subtype discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack consistency in leveraging cohort-wide features and integrating shared pathogenic interdependencies, limiting understanding of atherosclerotic trajectories.

Method: ATHENA constructs a hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning, optimizing patient-specific molecular fingerprints while aligning with cohort-wide patterns.

Result: The framework improved classification performance by up to 13% in AUC and 20% in F1 score on a dataset of 391 patients.

Conclusion: ATHENA enhances personalized intervention strategies and disease progression prediction through explainable AI-driven subnetwork clustering.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in RLHF by proposing a unified reward modeling framework combining BT single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions, improving robustness and performance in OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF is vulnerable to reward hacking, especially in OOD scenarios, and existing methods struggle with multi-objective reward functions due to limited high-quality data.

Method: A unified framework jointly trains BT single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space, leveraging their complementary benefits.

Result: The framework enhances robustness against reward hacking in OOD settings and improves scoring performance, with a 7B model outperforming a 70B baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves reward model robustness and performance, addressing key challenges in RLHF.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Conclusion: GRIT's combination of transformers and graph neural networks enables robust modeling of complex ice layer dynamics, enhancing radar imagery analysis.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice layer thickness and variability is vital for climate modeling and ice dynamics, but current methods lack robustness in handling noise and long-range dependencies.

Method: ST-GRIT uses inductive geometric graph learning to extract spatial features and employs separate temporal and spatial attention blocks to model dependencies.

Result: ST-GRIT achieves lower root mean-squared error than state-of-the-art methods on Greenland ice sheet radargram data.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT's attention mechanisms improve noise handling, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies, offering a superior approach for ice layer analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLC is a framework that learns collective variables (CVs) from time-lagged conditions of a generative model, improving rare event sampling in molecular dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in molecular dynamics are hard to observe due to long timescales; existing ML methods for CV discovery often miss detailed dynamics.

Method: TLC learns CVs by modeling a time-lagged conditional distribution, capturing slow dynamics, and is tested on Alanine Dipeptide using SMD and OPES.

Result: TLC performs equal or better than existing MLCV methods in transition path sampling and state discrimination.

Conclusion: TLC effectively captures dynamic behavior for enhanced sampling, outperforming traditional ML-based CV discovery methods.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

TL;DR: GTED is a novel evaluation framework for autoformalization, outperforming existing metrics in accuracy and Kappa scores on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current evaluation methods, such as lack of semantic understanding, high computational costs, and reliance on theorem proving progress.

Method: Proposes GTED, which standardizes formal statements into operator trees and uses tree edit distance for semantic similarity.

Result: GTED achieves highest accuracy and Kappa scores on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTED provides a more faithful metric for automated evaluation of autoformalization.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental

### [211] [HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405)
*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGMP, a multi-task prompt framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks. It unifies task formats, uses contrastive pre-training, and introduces feature prompts, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks in heterogeneous graph neural networks, and improve performance in multi-task scenarios.

Method: Proposes HGMP: (1) unifies downstream tasks into a graph-level format, (2) designs a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy, and (3) introduces heterogeneous feature prompts.

Result: HGMP adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: HGMP effectively bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, enhancing performance in heterogeneous graph applications.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

### [212] [Neural networks leverage nominally quantum and post-quantum representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07432)
*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott,Adam S. Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep neural networks pretrained on next-token prediction inherently represent beliefs over low-dimensional generative models of their data, akin to Bayesian updates, outperforming classical circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neural networks naturally discover and represent beliefs over generative models of their training data, surpassing classical methods.

Method: Pretraining deep neural networks (transformers, RNNs) on next-token prediction and analyzing their latent state representations.

Result: Neural nets intrinsically form geometric relationships in activations, representing probability densities over futures, independent of architecture.

Conclusion: Neural networks inherently model beliefs over data-generating processes, with geometric relationships reflecting past-future influences.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

*Nawaf Alampara,Anagha Aneesh,Martiño Ríos-García,Adrian Mirza,Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi,Ali Asghar Aghajani,Meiling Sun,Gordan Prastalo,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews the potential of general-purpose models (GPMs) like large language models in addressing the challenges of diverse, small, and fuzzy datasets in chemical sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical sciences face challenges with diverse, small, and fuzzy datasets that conventional machine learning struggles to handle. GPMs offer a promising solution due to their flexibility and ability to operate with minimal data.

Method: The paper discusses the fundamental principles of GPMs and reviews their recent applications in chemical sciences.

Result: While many GPM applications in chemistry are still in the prototype phase, their potential is significant.

Conclusion: GPMs are expected to mature and play a transformative role in chemical sciences in the near future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

### [214] [Resolving Token-Space Gradient Conflicts: Token Space Manipulation for Transformer-Based Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07485)
*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL improves multi-task learning by dynamically adapting token space to mitigate negative transfer, avoiding excessive parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative transfer in multi-task learning degrades performance; existing methods are inefficient due to rigid structures or parameter duplication.

Method: Proposes DTME-MTL, a framework that identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions without duplicating parameters.

Result: DTME-MTL consistently enhances multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL offers a scalable and efficient solution for transformer-based multi-task learning.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

### [215] [Uncertainty Quantification for Motor Imagery BCI -- Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07511)
*Joris Suurmeijer,Ivo Pascal de Jong,Matias Valdenegro-Toro,Andreea Ioana Sburlea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, finding traditional methods (CSP-LDA, MDRM) outperform deep learning in confidence calibration, with MDRM-T and CSP-LDA providing the best uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, as standard methods lack research in this area compared to deep learning.

Method: Comparison of uncertainty quantification in CSP-LDA, MDRM, deep ensembles, direct uncertainty quantification, and CNNs, with MDRM improved via Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T).

Result: CSP-LDA and MDRM-T offer the best uncertainty estimates, while deep ensembles and CNNs yield better classifications. All models can distinguish easy vs. difficult samples.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware classifiers can enhance BCI accuracy by rejecting ambiguous samples, with traditional methods excelling in confidence calibration.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

### [216] [Neural Concept Verifier: Scaling Prover-Verifier Games via Concept Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07532)
*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a framework combining Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVGs lack application to complex inputs like high-dimensional images, while CBMs are limited by linear predictors. NCV aims to bridge this gap.

Method: NCV uses minimally supervised concept discovery to extract structured encodings, with a prover selecting subsets for a nonlinear verifier to make decisions.

Result: NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG baselines on complex datasets and mitigates shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: NCV is a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

### [217] [Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559)
*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD is a real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, offering efficient, single-pass processing and superior performance in high-dimensional data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of real-time data streams, especially in IoT, demands efficient anomaly detection methods that operate without storing historical data, ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making.

Method: DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, unlike traditional methods that process entire datasets or windowed instances.

Result: DAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse anomaly types and is robust to increasing dimensionality, making it ideal for real-time, high-dimensional data streams.

Conclusion: DAD sets a new standard for real-time anomaly detection by balancing efficacy and computational efficiency, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

### [218] [COALA: Numerically Stable and Efficient Framework for Context-Aware Low-Rank Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07580)
*Uliana Parkina,Maxim Rakhuba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel inversion-free regularized framework is proposed to address numerical instabilities in context-aware low-rank approximation for neural networks, improving stability and handling challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for low-rank approximation in neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and inversion, degrading approximation quality.

Method: The proposed method avoids inversion by using stable decompositions, handling scenarios like large calibration matrices, nearly singular input activation matrices, and insufficient data.

Result: The framework overcomes numerical pitfalls, ensures stability, and provides explicit error bounds for cases with insufficient data.

Conclusion: The inversion-free regularized framework offers a robust solution for stable and high-quality low-rank approximation in neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

### [219] [CHOMET: Conditional Handovers via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07581)
*Michail Kalntis,Fernando A. Kuipers,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework optimizes conditional handovers (CHOs) in cellular networks, outperforming 3GPP benchmarks by 180% in volatile conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional handovers struggle with delays and failures in complex networks; CHOs improve success rates but introduce resource and signaling challenges.

Method: Proposes a meta-learning framework aligned with O-RAN for CHO optimization, focusing on dynamic regret guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates 180% better performance than 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses CHO challenges, enhancing performance in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

### [220] [Improving Clustering on Occupational Text Data through Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07582)
*Iago Xabier Vázquez García,Damla Partanaz,Emrullah Fatih Yetkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a BERT-based clustering pipeline for mapping O*NET occupations, evaluates dimensionality reduction, and improves results with a specialized silhouette approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occupational definitions vary across firms/countries, necessitating a mapping mechanism for expanding O*NET data.

Method: BERT-based techniques with clustering approaches, dimensionality reduction evaluation, and a specialized silhouette method.

Result: Improved clustering performance and automated occupation distinction.

Conclusion: The approach aids career transitions by enabling automatic occupation mapping.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

### [221] [Stress Monitoring in Healthcare: An Ensemble Machine Learning Framework Using Wearable Sensor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07589)
*Arpana Sinhal,Anay Sinhal,Amit Sinhal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a multimodal dataset and advanced machine learning models to improve real-time stress monitoring for healthcare workers, addressing gaps in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workers, especially nurses, face high occupational stress, worsened by COVID-19. Current wearable sensor studies lack comprehensive data and robust analysis.

Method: A multimodal dataset (physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate, skin temperature) was preprocessed with SMOTE. Random Forest, XGBoost, and MLP models were combined into a Stacking Classifier.

Result: The study developed a reproducible pipeline for stress monitoring, improving model generalizability and addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: The work advances deployable stress-monitoring systems, with future research focusing on demographic diversity and edge-computing for low-latency alerts.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

### [222] [Synthetic MC via Biological Transmitters: Therapeutic Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07604)
*Sebastian Lotter,Elisabeth Mohr,Andrina Rutsch,Lukas Brand,Francesca Ronchi,Laura Díaz-Marugán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic molecular communication (SMC) and personal health data to improve therapeutic modulation of the gut-brain axis (GBA) for treating neurological diseases like drug refractory epilepsy (DRE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GBA modulation treatments are standardized or heuristic, often failing for some patients. The paper aims to leverage IoBNT devices and machine learning to design more effective and personalized treatments.

Method: The authors define theoretical requirements for GBA modulation and propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements with limited data. The model is evaluated on datasets to identify GBA modulators.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy in identifying GBA modulators and specific pathways crucial for therapeutic modulation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for developing personalized and robust GBA modulation treatments, enhancing the effectiveness of SMC in healthcare.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

TL;DR: SParSeFuL introduces a resource-aware federated learning method to reduce energy and bandwidth usage, addressing sustainability in IoT ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning is unsustainable for IoT ecosystems due to high resource demands, conflicting with green AI principles.

Method: Combines aggregate computing for self-organization and neural network sparsification to minimize resource consumption.

Result: Reduces energy and bandwidth usage, making federated learning more sustainable for IoT.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL effectively bridges the gap between federated learning and sustainability in IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of
resource-constrained devices attempt to participate. To this end, we introduce
Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

*Junyu Luo,Yuhao Tang,Yiwei Fu,Xiao Luo,Zhizhuo Kou,Zhiping Xiao,Wei Ju,Wentao Zhang,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLOGAN improves unsupervised graph domain adaptation by disentangling causal features, using generative intervention, and dynamic calibration for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for UGDA perform poorly due to entangled causal-spurious features and ineffective global alignment.

Method: SLOGAN uses sparse causal modeling, variational inference, generative intervention, and dynamic calibration to enhance feature transfer.

Result: SLOGAN outperforms baselines in experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SLOGAN effectively addresses UGDA challenges with its novel approach, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer model, improves EEG-based Parkinson's Disease detection by addressing inter-subject variability, achieving higher accuracy and consistency compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based Deep Learning models for Parkinson's Disease detection suffer from poor generalizability due to high inter-subject variability, necessitating better architectures.

Method: Introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid model with a depthwise convolutional tokenizer for effective feature mixing in self-attention layers, evaluated using harmonized EEG datasets and N-LNSO cross-validation.

Result: TransformEEG achieved the highest median balanced accuracy (78.45%) and lowest variability (6.37%), improving to 80.10% with augmentation and threshold correction.

Conclusion: TransformEEG provides more consistent and reliable Parkinson's Disease detection, reducing variability and outperforming other models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

*Carlos Beis Penedo,Rebeca P. Díaz Redondo,Ana Fernández Vilas,Manuel Fernández Veiga,Francisco Troncoso Pastoriza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized architecture combining Federated Split Learning (FSL) with Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) addresses privacy and scalability issues in collaborative machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of centralized Federated Learning (privacy risks, single points of failure) and poor scalability of Split Learning.

Method: Uses HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to orchestrate FSL's split model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without a central server.

Result: Matches centralized FSL accuracy on CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks while reducing training time and maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates enterprise-grade viability with minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep

### [227] [Some Theoretical Results on Layerwise Effective Dimension Oscillations in Finite Width ReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07675)
*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the layerwise effective dimension (rank) in finite-width ReLU networks, deriving closed-form expressions for expected rank and identifying revival depths where rank peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how random ReLU layers affect the rank of hidden activation matrices and how this impacts expressivity in deep networks.

Method: Derives closed-form expressions for expected rank using random Gaussian weights, proves sub-Gaussian concentration bounds, and identifies revival depths.

Result: Expected rank decays geometrically with ratio ~0.3634, peaks at specific revival depths (~0.79m), and oscillates due to finite-width effects.

Conclusion: Random ReLU layers alternately collapse and revive input subspaces, revealing nuanced expressivity in deep networks.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

*Zhuang Qi,Lei Meng,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCBDR introduces a class-wise balancing data replay method for FCIL, addressing class imbalance via global coordination and task-aware temperature scaling, improving accuracy by 2%-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in federated class incremental learning limits performance, especially in replay-based methods. FedCBDR aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: FedCBDR uses global-perspective data replay for balanced sampling and task-aware temperature scaling to adjust logits dynamically.

Result: FedCBDR outperforms six state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2%-15% higher Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: FedCBDR effectively addresses class imbalance in FCIL, enhancing generalization and accuracy through balanced replay and adaptive temperature scaling.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

### [229] [GuardVal: Dynamic Large Language Model Jailbreak Evaluation for Comprehensive Safety Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07735)
*Peiyan Zhang,Haibo Jin,Liying Kang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardVal, a dynamic evaluation protocol for jailbreak attacks on LLMs, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and offering insights into model vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for jailbreak attacks on LLMs are inadequate due to evolving threats and sophisticated vulnerabilities, necessitating a more robust protocol.

Method: The authors propose GuardVal, a protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, alongside an optimization method to prevent stagnation.

Result: Applied to models like Mistral-7b and GPT-4, GuardVal reveals distinct behavioral patterns and vulnerabilities across 10 safety domains.

Conclusion: The protocol enhances understanding of LLM robustness, providing actionable insights for future research and development of more secure models.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

*Tomu Hirata,Undral Byambadalai,Tatsushi Oka,Shota Yasui,Shingo Uto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-task neural network method for estimating distributional treatment effects (DTE) addresses data imbalance and computational inefficiencies, outperforming conventional methods in simulated and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTE offers granular insights beyond Average Treatment Effect (ATE), but existing regression methods struggle with tail precision and scalability.

Method: Multi-task neural networks with monotonic constraints and multi-threshold label learning to estimate conditional outcome distributions.

Result: Superior performance in simulated and real-world datasets, including water conservation and A/B testing scenarios.

Conclusion: The method is robust and practical for detailed causal inference in modern applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

*Jaeheun Jung,Bosung Jung,Suhyun Bae,Donghun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shallow forgetting in machine unlearning, proposes a 'deep forgetting' criterion, and introduces the One-Point-Contraction (OPC) algorithm for robust unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods only superficially forget data, retaining internal representations that can be exploited. This poses privacy and ethical risks.

Method: The authors define 'deep forgetting' based on feature representation contraction and propose the OPC algorithm to enforce it.

Result: OPC outperforms existing methods in unlearning effectiveness and resilience against attacks like performance recovery and gradient-inversion.

Conclusion: OPC's success highlights the need for robust unlearning methods grounded in deep feature forgetting.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

### [232] [TRIX- Trading Adversarial Fairness via Mixed Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07768)
*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX is a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns adversaries to classes based on their vulnerability, improving fairness and robustness in adversarial defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, leading to unfair robustness where strong classes become robust while weak classes remain vulnerable. TRIX addresses this disparity.

Method: TRIX adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, with per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments.

Result: TRIX improves worst-case class accuracy on clean and adversarial data, reduces inter-class robustness disparities, and maintains overall accuracy.

Conclusion: TRIX is a practical solution for fair and effective adversarial defense, balancing robustness across classes.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

*Ruohong Liu,Jack Umenberger,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the scalability and generalization challenges of RL-based agents in building energy management, proposing a multi-objective contextual RL framework and benchmarking its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalability and generalization in RL approaches for building energy management across diverse environments and objectives.

Method: Formulates a multi-objective contextual RL problem, parameterizes contextual information, and creates a benchmark for evaluating generalizable RL algorithms.

Result: Existing multi-objective RL methods achieve reasonable trade-offs but degrade under certain environmental variations, highlighting the need for dynamics-dependent contextual information.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information into policy learning is crucial for improving the generalization of RL methods in building energy management.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

TL;DR: S4T synchronizes multiple tasks during test-time training to address domain shifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unsynchronized task behavior in conventional TTT methods when handling multiple tasks under domain shifts.

Method: Proposes S4T, which predicts task relations across domain shifts to synchronize tasks during test time.

Result: Empirical results show S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: S4T effectively synchronizes tasks in multi-task scenarios under domain shifts, improving generalization.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

*Hermann Klein,Max Heinz Herkersdorf,Oliver Nelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a space-filling regularization method to improve state space data distribution, enhancing training, interpretability, and robustness in nonlinear system identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor data coverage in state space due to trajectory deformations hinders training and interpretability, especially in local model networks.

Method: Proposes data-distribution-based penalty techniques for state trajectories in local affine state space models, integrating modeling and design of experiments.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on a benchmark system, showing improved data distribution and interpretability.

Conclusion: The regularization method successfully addresses state space deformation issues, benefiting training and interpretability in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

TL;DR: SAMVAE is a multimodal deep learning framework for survival analysis in oncology, integrating six data modalities to improve prediction accuracy and provide interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival prediction methods rely on single data modalities, limiting their ability to capture tumor complexity. SAMVAE addresses this by integrating diverse data sources.

Method: SAMVAE uses modality-specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality-specific information. It handles both standard and competing risks scenarios.

Result: SAMVAE achieves competitive performance in breast cancer and lower grade glioma cohorts, successfully integrating multimodal data for survival analysis.

Conclusion: SAMVAE provides interpretable, data-driven survival predictions, enhancing clinical decision-making and setting a foundation for future multimodal survival analysis in oncology.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and control of the Lipschitz constant in transformer self-attention blocks, enhancing model robustness.

Method: Develops a refined closed-form expression for the softmax function's spectral norm, leading to a more accurate Lipschitz bound. Introduces JaSMin, a regularization term to minimize Jacobian softmax norms.

Result: The new bound is more accurate and reveals the role of attention score maps in robustness. JaSMin effectively boosts transformer robustness.

Conclusion: The refined Lipschitz bound and JaSMin regularization advance transformer robustness and provide insights into attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data, aiming to improve estimation accuracy.

Method: Develops data-dependent Bernstein inequalities for vector-valued processes, exploiting correlation decay between temporally separated variables.

Result: Achieves novel risk bounds for covariance operator estimation and operator learning in dynamical systems.

Conclusion: The introduced inequalities provide practical improvements in estimation, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for tabular data lack textual columns, and finding datasets with rich text features is challenging.

Method: Proposes ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into tabular pipelines and curates real-world datasets with meaningful text features.

Result: Benchmarks how advanced tabular foundation models perform with textual data.

Conclusion: The study advances benchmarking for tabular foundation models with text, addressing a gap in current research.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm extracts interpretable policies (e.g., linear policies) from expert behavior in DRL, addressing the interpretability challenge without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability in DRL hinders deployment in mission-critical settings, despite its success in complex tasks.

Method: The algorithm leverages the advantage function to train interpretable policies using existing experience, unlike prior approaches.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the algorithm effectively extracts meaningful information from complex expert policies in control and financial trading scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap between interpretability and performance in DRL, enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how using a pre-trained AI model to impute missing covariates affects decision-making regret, introducing 'model elasticity' to quantify this impact. It shows that under MAR, model calibration improves regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of pre-trained AI models on sequential decision-making when covariates are missing, and to quantify regret due to imputation.

Method: Introduces 'model elasticity' to measure reward sensitivity to imputation errors. Uses orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression for model calibration under MAR.

Result: Model elasticity provides a unified regret characterization. Calibration under MAR improves imputation quality and regret guarantees.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models are valuable in decision-making, and model elasticity is a key metric for integrating them effectively.

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient descent in variational inference, even for simple cases like Gaussian approximations. It proposes a square-root parameterization for covariance to establish new convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the theoretical challenges in proving convergence for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference, despite its practical success.

Method: The method involves using a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance to analyze convergence for natural-gradient descent and its continuous-time gradient flow.

Result: The results provide novel convergence guarantees for natural-gradient methods and demonstrate their superiority over Euclidean or Wasserstein-based algorithms in experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of natural-gradient methods and the theoretical advancements made possible by the square-root parameterization.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Motivation: SMEs are crucial to the economy but face challenges in credit risk analysis due to limited data, especially for online lenders.

Method: Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze SME interactions from transaction and social data for spatial dependency mapping and default risk prediction.

Result: Achieves AUCs of 0.995 (supply chain mining) and 0.701 (default prediction), outperforming traditional and other GNN baselines.

Conclusion: The GNN framework offers a scalable, effective solution for SME credit risk assessment, aiding regulators and stress testers.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

### [244] [Principled Foundations for Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07855)
*Wenxuan Zhou,Shujian Zhang,Brice Magdalou,John Lambert,Ehsan Amid,Richard Nock,Andrew Hard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects direct preference optimization (DPO) to broader theories in ML, showing its generality and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand DPO's theoretical foundations and its broader implications in ML, given its current momentum and diverse applications.

Method: Establishes a connection between Savage's loss functions and stochastic choice theories, generalizing DPO to include abstention, non-convex objectives, and extensions like margins and length corrections.

Result: DPO is shown to be a specific case of a broader theoretical framework, enabling support for various practical extensions and highlighting pitfalls of deviating from this framework.

Conclusion: Understanding DPO's general principles is crucial for its diverse applications and helps identify pitfalls and workarounds in its variations.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

*Tianang Leng,Fangping Wan,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ApexOracle is an AI model that predicts antibiotic potency and designs new molecules to combat antimicrobial resistance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the slow pace of antibiotic development necessitate faster, more effective solutions to identify and design antibiotics against emerging pathogens.

Method: ApexOracle integrates pathogen-specific context using a discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework combining genomic and literature data.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting antibiotic activity and reliably transfers to novel pathogens, even with limited data. It also generates new molecules with high predicted efficacy.

Conclusion: ApexOracle provides a scalable solution to combat AMR and prepare for future infectious-disease outbreaks by combining rapid prediction and targeted molecular generation.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

TL;DR: Co-folding models can enhance ML-based scoring functions for binding affinity prediction if augmented data is structurally sound. Simple heuristics help identify quality predictions without experimental structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for binding affinity prediction by leveraging synthetic data augmentation via co-folding models.

Method: Evaluated co-folding models for synthetic data augmentation, focusing on structural quality. Developed heuristics to identify high-quality predictions without reference structures.

Result: Performance gains depend on structural quality of augmented data. Heuristics enable substitution of experimental structures with co-folding predictions.

Conclusion: Co-folding models are viable for data augmentation in MLSF training, with quality heuristics guiding effective use.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding
predictions without reference structures, enabling them to substitute for
experimental structures in MLSF training. Our study informs future data
augmentation strategies based on co-folding models.

*Hao Ban,Gokul Ram Subramani,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMO integrates sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into multi-task learning (MTL) to mitigate task conflicts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task conflicts in MTL limit performance; SAM's effectiveness in reducing sharpness motivates its integration.

Method: SAMO uses joint global-local perturbation, approximating local perturbations with forward passes and layerwise normalization.

Result: SAMO improves MTL performance efficiently, validated on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMO effectively addresses task conflicts in MTL with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

### [248] [UnIT: Scalable Unstructured Inference-Time Pruning for MAC-efficient Neural Inference on MCUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07885)
*Ashe Neth,Sawinder kaur,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Subrata Biswas,Asif Salekin,Bashima Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnIT introduces unstructured inference-time pruning for MCUs, reducing MAC operations without retraining or hardware changes, improving efficiency and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods underutilize fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support, limiting their effectiveness for low-power MCUs.

Method: UnIT dynamically skips unnecessary MAC operations during inference using input-specific activation patterns, lightweight comparisons, and optimized division approximations.

Result: UnIT achieves significant MAC reduction (11.02%-82.03%), faster inference (27.30%-84.19%), and lower energy consumption (27.33%-84.38%) while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: UnIT is a practical, retraining-free solution for efficient deep neural network deployment on MCUs, even under domain shifts.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-agent driven method to dynamically track emerging topics in earnings calls, structuring them into a hierarchical ontology for financial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling fails to capture evolving industry trends dynamically.

Method: Uses an LLM-agent to extract topics, build a hierarchical ontology, and link new topics to existing ones.

Result: Demonstrates company-level insights and trend detection, evaluated via ontology coherence and topic evolution accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively surfaces emerging financial trends, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

### [252] [Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)
*Sol Yarkoni,Roi Livni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new low-resource attack method identifies benign prompts that unintentionally reconstruct training images, highlighting risks in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and copyright risks in generative models by demonstrating how easily training data can be reconstructed without high resources or direct access.

Method: Leverages domain knowledge and templated prompts from scraped e-commerce data to identify vulnerabilities, enabling image reconstruction with seemingly harmless prompts.

Result: Shows that even uninformed users can unintentionally reconstruct real images, such as a human face from a prompt like "blue Unisex T-Shirt."

Conclusion: Reveals a fundamental vulnerability in models using scraped data, emphasizing the need for better safeguards against unintentional data leakage.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [253] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-Net, a hierarchical model that replaces traditional tokenization with dynamic chunking, outperforming token-based Transformers and improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in language models remains a barrier to true end-to-end learning. The goal is to eliminate pre-processing steps by learning segmentation strategies jointly with the model.

Method: H-Net uses a dynamic chunking mechanism and hierarchical architecture to learn content- and context-dependent segmentation, replacing tokenization with a single end-to-end model.

Result: H-Net outperforms token-based Transformers, scales better with data, and shows improved robustness, especially in languages with weak tokenization heuristics (e.g., Chinese, code, DNA).

Conclusion: H-Net demonstrates the potential of true end-to-end models, offering better performance, scalability, and robustness without relying on tokenization heuristics.

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to the prospective learning framework to handle dynamic data and evolving goals, extending it to sequential decision-making like foraging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC learning fails with dynamic data and changing objectives, leading to suboptimal performance. Prospective learning addresses this but needs enhancement.

Method: The authors build on prospective learning, improving algorithms and numerical results, and extend it to sequential decision-making.

Result: Preliminary results show improved performance in handling dynamic data and sequential tasks like foraging.

Conclusion: The extended prospective learning framework shows promise for dynamic and sequential applications, with code available for further exploration.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

TL;DR: Q-chunking improves RL for long-horizon tasks by using action chunking from offline data to enhance exploration and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in offline-to-online RL, such as leveraging offline data for effective exploration and sample-efficient learning.

Method: Applies action chunking to TD-based RL, enabling temporally consistent behaviors from offline data and unbiased n-step backups.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in offline performance and online sample efficiency on sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: Q-chunking is a simple, effective solution for improving RL in long-horizon, sparse-reward settings.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXPO improves sample efficiency in online RL by using an expressive base policy and a lightweight Gaussian edit policy to maximize value without direct optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive policies in online RL is challenging due to unstable gradient propagation, which hinders stable value maximization.

Method: Proposes EXPO, an algorithm with two policies: a stable expressive base policy and a Gaussian edit policy to maximize Q-value.

Result: Achieves 2-3x better sample efficiency compared to prior methods in fine-tuning and leveraging offline data.

Conclusion: EXPO effectively addresses stable value maximization in expressive policies, enhancing sample efficiency in online RL.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretrained LLMs can dynamically adapt their architecture per input using a chain-of-layers (CoLa) approach, improving efficiency and accuracy via MCTS-optimized paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if pretrained models can adapt architectures per input without finetuning, optimizing inference efficiency and performance.

Method: Manipulate pretrained LLM layers as modules (skip, repeat, reorder) to form CoLa per sample, optimized via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Result: CoLa finds shorter paths (75% correct samples) and corrects errors (60% incorrect samples), outperforming fixed architectures.

Conclusion: Dynamic depth adaptation (CoLa) unlocks LLM potential, highlighting limitations of fixed architectures and enabling test-time optimization.

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

TL;DR: A multilayer GNN framework improves predictive maintenance for power grids by integrating spatial, temporal, and causal dependencies, outperforming traditional models and enabling resilience-based substation clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually, partly due to inadequate predictive maintenance models that ignore key dependencies in grid failures.

Method: The study uses a multilayer GNN framework combining Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), validated with seven years of incident data from Oklahoma Gas & Electric.

Result: The model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935, outperforming XGBoost, Random Forest, and single-layer GNNs. Resilience analysis identifies eight risk groups, with ANOVA confirming significant inter-cluster separation.

Conclusion: The framework enhances proactive grid management through superior failure prediction and risk-aware substation clustering, validated by outperforming traditional clustering methods.

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.

Motivation: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy is challenging due to noise and dense filament networks. Existing deep learning models struggle in noisy or low-contrast conditions.

Method: Developed ASE_Res_UNet by enhancing U-Net with residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention in the decoder. Evaluated using synthetic and real datasets.

Result: ASE_Res_UNet outperformed variants (U-Net, ASE_UNet, Res_UNet) and state-of-the-art models, excelling in noise resilience and detecting low-intensity structures.

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet generalizes well to real microscopy images and other curvilinear structures, showing promise for disease diagnosis and treatment applications.

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanding knowledge and experimental workload in chemistry and materials science create opportunities for ML to enhance research efficiency.

Result: LMExt successfully extracted diverse data, and the ML model accurately predicted thermodynamic properties like enthalpy of formation.

Conclusion: Integrated ML approaches can reshape research in chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly
expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide
unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large
language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training
of an ML model to predict chemical knowledge (thermodynamic parameters). Our
LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical
information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability
constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,
enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative
potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials
science research.

### [262] [Distributed and Decentralised Training: Technical Governance Challenges in a Shifting AI Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07765)
*Jakub Kryś,Yashvardhan Sharma,Janet Egan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the differences between distributed and decentralized AI training, highlighting their governance risks (e.g., compute structuring, capability proliferation) and potential benefits (e.g., privacy, reduced power concentration). It calls for precise policymaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the distinctions between distributed and decentralized AI training and their implications for AI governance, addressing risks and benefits.

Method: Analysis of distributed and decentralized training scenarios, their impacts on governance, and policy relevance.

Result: Identified risks (e.g., erosion of detectability) and benefits (e.g., privacy) of decentralized AI, emphasizing policy levers like export controls.

Conclusion: Advocates for nuanced policymaking to address governance challenges and harness benefits of decentralized AI.

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

*Felix Frohnert,Denny Lane B. Sombrillo,Evert van Nieuwenburg,Patrick Emonts*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method to classify pole structures in hadron spectroscopy, achieving high accuracy and generalizing to experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of matching theoretical predictions to experimental data in hadron spectroscopy, especially near threshold, where pole structures are ambiguous.

Method: An uncertainty-aware machine learning approach using an ensemble of classifier chains, providing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates.

Result: Validation accuracy of nearly 95%, with successful application to experimental data like the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state, inferring a four-pole structure.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and broadly applicable for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

TL;DR: IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer for speech processing, addresses SNN challenges with input-aware multi-level spikes and HD-RepSSA, achieving competitive performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs struggle with high computational overhead and lack of large-scale architectures for speech tasks.

Method: Introduces IML-Spikeformer with IMLS mechanism and HD-RepSSA module for efficient spike firing and attention precision.

Result: Achieves 6.0% WER on AiShell-1 and 3.4% on Librispeech-960, with 4.64x and 4.32x energy reduction.

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer advances scalable SNNs for speech processing in performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy
efficiency.

*Marcel Hudiani*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence rates of SGD and SHB for convex and non-convex objectives, using discrete Gronwall's inequality. It provides almost sure convergence rates and probabilistic bounds for SHB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence behavior of SGD and SHB in parametric settings, especially for convex and non-convex objectives with Hölder gradients, without relying on complex theorems.

Method: Uses discrete Gronwall's inequality to derive convergence rates for SGD and SHB, avoiding Robbins-Siegmund theorem or martingale theory.

Result: For non-convex objectives, min gradient norm is o(t^(p-1)). For convex objectives, SHB achieves O(t^(max(p-1,-2p+1)) log²(t/δ)) with probability 1-δ.

Conclusion: The study provides simplified proofs and new insights into the convergence rates of SGD and SHB, confirming their effectiveness under specific conditions.

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in
(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates semantic data storage on various DLT types (public, private, hybrid) using a real-world knowledge graph, finding private DLTs most efficient and hybrid DLTs offering a balance between auditability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in efficient semantic data storage on DLTs for decentralised data spaces, ensuring interoperability and sovereignty.

Method: Systematic evaluation of semantic data storage across public, private, and hybrid DLTs using a real-world knowledge graph, comparing performance, storage efficiency, and query capabilities.

Result: Private DLTs are most efficient for semantic data; hybrid DLTs balance auditability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The choice of DLT infrastructure should align with data sovereignty needs in decentralised ecosystems.

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Analysis of collective communication patterns in ML jobs reveals network congestion issues, suggesting a need for rethinking communication frameworks and topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address network congestion and packet loss caused by bursty traffic in distributed ML jobs, impacting performance.

Method: Instrumented Nvidia Collective Communication Library for logging, adjusted parameters like parallelism and node count, and analyzed behavior in models like DeepSeek V3.

Result: Identified operation types, transfer sizes, and request distributions, highlighting the impact of network anomalies.

Conclusion: Current collective communication frameworks and network topologies need reevaluation to better support ML workloads.

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Helix Parallelism improves LLM efficiency by combining KV parallelism for attention and TP/EP for FFN, reducing latency and enabling larger batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in FFN weight access and KV cache reads for real-time autoregressive decoding in large-scale LLMs.

Method: Introduces Helix Parallelism, a hybrid strategy using KV parallelism for attention and TP/EP for FFN, with lightweight communication to preserve exact attention behavior.

Result: Reduces Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) by 1.5x and supports 32x larger batches, improving throughput-latency efficiency.

Conclusion: Helix Parallelism advances real-time inference for ultra-long sequences, making it practical on platforms like Blackwell.

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

### [269] [Distributed Training under Packet Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07114)
*Erez Weintraub,Ron Banner,Ariel Orda*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel distributed training framework enables robust training over unreliable connections, ensuring unbiased gradients and bounded parameter drift without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed frameworks assume reliable connections, inflating latency and limiting scalability. Unreliable connections reduce latency but risk accuracy loss due to packet drops.

Method: Introduces a two-stage defense: (i) unbiased gradient aggregation from received packets, and (ii) bounded-drift parameter broadcasts to prevent unbounded divergence.

Result: Experiments on LLAMA2 7B with 64 GPUs show ≤0.8% perplexity change under 10% packet loss.

Conclusion: The framework bridges datacenter protocols and large-model training needs, enabling robust learning on commodity networks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Ampere is a novel FL system that reduces computation and communication costs while improving accuracy by using unidirectional inter-block training and a lightweight auxiliary network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Split Federated Learning (SFL), such as high communication overhead and reduced accuracy for non-IID data.

Method: Proposes unidirectional inter-block training with local loss and a lightweight auxiliary network to decouple device-server training, reducing gradient transfers.

Result: Improves accuracy by up to 13.26%, reduces training time by 94.6%, communication overhead by 99.1%, and computation by 93.13%.

Conclusion: Ampere outperforms SFL by efficiently handling non-IID data and significantly reducing resource usage.

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

<details>

Motivation: Multiscale modeling of complex phenomena, like biomolecular interactions, requires bridging gaps between scales and managing massive computational workflows. Traditional methods are resource-intensive, and newer ML approaches offer potential solutions.

Method: The paper presents mini-MuMMI, a streamlined version of the MuMMI infrastructure, enabling multiscale workflows on modest systems. It orchestrates thousands of molecular dynamics simulations across different scales.

Result: Mini-MuMMI successfully models RAS-RAF membrane interactions and shows promise for broader applications beyond molecular dynamics.

Conclusion: Mini-MuMMI addresses scalability challenges in multiscale modeling, making it accessible for smaller systems and diverse applications.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

Motivation: To understand the limitations and properties of approximating polytopes, particularly simplices, in computational geometry.

Method: Analyzes approximations of target polytopes by polytopes of a given depth, using Minkowski sums and unions.

Result: Simplices can only be trivially approximated and are characterized as the only 'outer additive' convex bodies.

Conclusion: Simplices have unique properties in polytope approximation, limiting their approximation capabilities.

Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores AI-generated catalogue descriptions for photographic collections, finding they can approximate human quality but require human review for accuracy, especially in specialized domains like archaeology. Experts are cautious about adoption, emphasizing trust and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of photographic collections exceeds manual cataloguing capacity, prompting the need for automated solutions like vision language models (VLMs).

Method: A VLM (InternVL2) generated descriptions for archaeological photos, evaluated by experts and non-experts in a human-centered framework, assessing classification, quality, and trust.

Result: AI-generated descriptions were hard to distinguish from human-written ones, but OCR errors and hallucinations affected quality. Experts were less willing to adopt AI, prioritizing preservation responsibility.

Conclusion: AI can assist in draft generation but must be verified by humans to align with curatorial values. Trust and transparency are key for successful integration.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

### [275] [Time Series Foundation Models for Multivariate Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07296)
*Ben A. Marconi*

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for financial forecasting, showing strong transferability and sample efficiency, but highlights the need for domain-specific refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time series forecasting is challenging due to nonlinear relationships, dependencies, and data scarcity. TSFMs offer a solution through pretraining and adaptation.

Method: Two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers and Chronos) are tested on three financial tasks: Treasury yield changes, EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction.

Result: Pretrained TTM outperformed untrained models by 25-50% with limited data and showed zero-shot success in some tasks. However, traditional models matched or exceeded TTM in two tasks.

Conclusion: TSFMs show promise for financial forecasting, especially in data-constrained scenarios, but require domain-specific pretraining and refinements for competitive performance.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

### [276] [Synergistic Localization and Sensing in MIMO-OFDM Systems via Mixed-Integer Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07118)
*Zelin Zhu,Kai Yang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a joint modeling and optimization approach for wireless localization and sensing using deep learning and MIMO-OFDM systems, introducing a novel algorithm (SPG-MIBO) with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless localization and sensing are crucial for modern networks and applications, but joint modeling under high-dimensional CSI in MIMO-OFDM systems is underexplored.

Method: Formulates tasks as a mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and introduces SPG-MIBO, a stochastic proximal gradient-based algorithm for high-dimensional data.

Result: SPG-MIBO shows computational efficiency and performance gains in joint optimization, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively harnesses synergy between localization and sensing, advancing high-performance wireless systems.

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

*Renyuan Liu,Yuyang Leng,Kaiyan Liu,Shaohan Hu,Chun-Fu,Chen,Peijun Zhao,Heechul Yun,Shuochao Yao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DAF is a Dynamic Activation Framework for efficient on-device training, reducing memory usage by 22.9x and speeding up training by 3.2x without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome memory constraints in mobile/edge devices by compressing activations efficiently during training.

Method: DAF uses hybrid reduction operations, CPU-GPU bit-packing, and importance-aware paging for dynamic quantization and memory management.

Result: Achieves 22.9x memory reduction and 3.2x speedup on various models.

Conclusion: DAF is a scalable, practical solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator for Transposed Convolutions (TCONV), addressing inefficiencies in the Input-Oriented Mapping method. It achieves significant speedups and energy savings on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiencies of Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) in TCONV layers, such as complex output mapping and overlapping sums, hinder performance on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: MM2IM combines Matrix Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to efficiently process TCONV layers, implemented using the SECDA-TFLite toolkit.

Result: MM2IM achieves an average speedup of 1.9x, up to 4.2x on generative models, and outperforms other accelerators by 2x GOPs/DSP. It also reduces energy consumption by 2.4x.

Conclusion: MM2IM is an effective solution for accelerating TCONV layers on edge devices, offering significant performance and energy efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x
energy reduction against the CPU baseline.

Motivation: To systematically assess RAG configurations for scientific QA in cosmology and develop a scalable evaluation proxy (LLMaaJ) for the astrophysics community.

Method: Manual human evaluation of 945 answers from 9 RAG configurations on 105 QA pairs, followed by calibration of an LLM-as-a-Judge system.

Result: OpenAI's RAG configuration achieved 91.4% accuracy. The LLMaaJ system was successfully calibrated as a proxy for human evaluation.

Conclusion: The study identifies the best RAG configuration for astrophysics applications and provides a scalable evaluation tool (LLMaaJ), with all resources made publicly available.

Abstract: We evaluate 9 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent configurations on
105 Cosmology Question-Answer (QA) pairs that we built specifically for this
purpose.The RAG configurations are manually evaluated by a human expert, that
is, a total of 945 generated answers were assessed. We find that currently the
best RAG agent configuration is with OpenAI embedding and generative model,
yielding 91.4\% accuracy. Using our human evaluation results we calibrate
LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) system which can be used as a robust proxy for human
evaluation. These results allow us to systematically select the best RAG agent
configuration for multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery in
astrophysics (e.g., cmbagent presented in a companion paper) and provide us
with an LLMaaJ system that can be scaled to thousands of cosmology QA pairs. We
make our QA dataset, human evaluation results, RAG pipelines, and LLMaaJ system
publicly available for further use by the astrophysics community.

### [280] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-enhanced framework for personalized movie recommendations, improving traditional SVD/SVD++ algorithms by integrating text-based user preferences, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems lack personalization based on text-based user preferences. LLMs offer a promising solution to bridge this gap by mimicking human-like recommendations.

Method: The framework combines SVD/SVD++ algorithms (using the Surprise library and MovieLens dataset) with LLMs to refine recommendations. Performance is evaluated using hit rates, NDCG, and stratified train-test splits.

Result: The LLM-enhanced framework outperforms SVD/SVD++ significantly (e.g., ~6x higher cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x NDCG), despite slightly higher computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively personalizes recommendations using LLMs, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods, though with minor computational trade-offs.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

*Hengrui Liu,Yi Feng,Qilong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PILOC is a decentralized framework for MASAR, using local perception, communication, and a pheromone-based DRL mechanism to improve search efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic and unknown environments in MASAR pose challenges due to unpredictable targets and uncertainty. Existing methods lack efficiency in such scenarios.

Method: PILOC combines local communication with a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism embedded in DRL, enabling decentralized coordination without global knowledge.

Result: PILOC outperforms existing methods in search efficiency, adaptability, and robustness, especially in dynamic and communication-constrained settings.

Conclusion: PILOC offers a promising approach for MASAR, enhancing coordination and performance in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

### [282] [Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714)
*Julio Garrido,Javier Vales,Diego Silva-Muñiz,Enrique Riveiro,Pablo López-Matencio,Josué Rivera-Andrade*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to detect anomalies in Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) using only motor torque data, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDPRs require anomaly detection during stops to ensure safety, but existing methods may rely on additional sensors. This paper explores whether torque data alone can suffice.

Method: An adaptive GMM-based algorithm is introduced, fitting a model on anomaly-free data and using Mahalanobis distance for real-time anomaly detection, with periodic updates for adaptability.

Result: The method achieves 100% true positive and 95.4% true negative rates, with 1-second latency, outperforming non-adaptive and threshold-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects anomalies using only torque data, offering robustness and adaptability for CDPR applications.

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LangNav is a new dataset and benchmark (LangNavBench) for testing language-based semantic navigation, focusing on grounding words in instructions. It includes detailed object descriptions and introduces MLFM, a method outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack language-focused evaluation for semantic navigation. LangNav addresses this gap by testing agents' ability to ground words in instructions at varying detail levels.

Method: LangNav dataset was manually curated for accuracy. LangNavBench evaluates models on attributes, spatial cues, and hierarchies. MLFM, a multi-layered semantic map method, is introduced for better navigation.

Result: LangNav has lower error rates than existing datasets. MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially for small objects and spatial relations.

Conclusion: LangNav and LangNavBench provide a thorough, language-centric evaluation for embodied navigation, with MLFM showing superior performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conformal kinematic modeling framework for soft robots to address prediction uncertainty in data-driven models, demonstrating the robustness of nonlinear ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise kinematic modeling is crucial for soft robots but challenging due to their nonlinear behavior. Existing data-driven models lack reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: Investigates linear and nonlinear machine learning models, identifies robust nonlinear ensemble methods, and develops a conformal prediction framework for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Nonlinear ensemble methods show robust generalization. The conformal framework provides theoretically guaranteed prediction intervals.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves kinematic modeling accuracy by quantifying uncertainty, benefiting soft robot calibration and control.

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rule-based classification method using the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to distinguish FP and TP activations in AEBS, aiming to improve validation transparency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for validating AEBS rely on subjective human labeling, which can introduce biases and inconsistencies. A more objective approach is needed.

Method: A rule-based classification leveraging PDP is introduced to analyze AEBS activations, tested on a simplified system to identify strengths and limitations.

Result: The method shows potential to enhance classification transparency and consistency, suggesting its combination with human labeling for better validation.

Conclusion: The approach complements existing practices, offering a path to more reliable AEBS validation, with future refinements needed for broader applicability.

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: MODA is a diffusion framework unifying multiple molecular design tasks with a Bayesian mask scheduler, outperforming baselines in accuracy and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D molecular generators are fragmented across tasks, hindering stereochemical fidelity and zero-shot transfer. MODA aims to unify these tasks.

Method: MODA uses a Bayesian mask scheduler to train a model by masking and denoising spatial fragments, learning shared geometric and chemical priors. Multi-task training creates a universal backbone.

Result: MODA surpasses baselines in substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. It reduces clashes and divergences while maintaining compliance and achieving stable negative Vina scores.

Conclusion: A single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISME, a workflow integrating multimodal molecular embeddings to overcome limitations of task-specific methods, validated by improved performance in benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gene embedding methods are task-specific and fail to capture broad biological contexts, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: Used an adjusted SVCCA variant to analyze signal redundancy/complementarity, then developed PRISME, an autoencoder-based workflow for integrating embeddings.

Result: PRISME outperformed individual embeddings in tasks like missing value imputation, showing consistent performance.

Conclusion: PRISME enables robust, multimodal biomolecule modeling, advancing biomedical ML applications.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.

Motivation: To extend FOA generative AI models for immersive spatial audio in VR/AR, cinema, and music, enabling dynamic sound source generation.

Method: Proposes SonicMotion, an end-to-end model with two variations for user input and sound source localization precision, and introduces a new dataset of spatial audio-caption pairs.

Result: The models match state-of-the-art semantic alignment and audio quality while capturing spatial attributes.

Conclusion: SonicMotion successfully advances FOA generative models for dynamic spatial audio, supported by a new dataset.

Abstract: Spatial audio is an integral part of immersive entertainment, such as VR/AR,

format of spatial audio is described as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). We seek
to extend recent advancements in FOA generative AI models to enable the
generation of 3D scenes with dynamic sound sources. Our proposed end-to-end
model, SonicMotion, comes in two variations which vary in their user input and
level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we
also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation
of our models demonstrate that they are capable of matching the semantic
alignment and audio quality of state of the art models while capturing the
desired spatial attributes.

*Abdul Hannan,Daniele Falavigna,Alessio Brutti*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes input-driven layer dropping (LD) for dynamic neural architectures in edge/IoT settings, outperforming random dropping and matching early exit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing layer dropping methods for dynamic neural architectures in resource-varying edge/IoT environments.

Method: Uses input features and a lightweight layer-selecting network to determine optimal layer combinations.

Result: Outperforms random dropping and matches early exit on 4 speech/audio benchmarks.

Conclusion: Input-driven LD is effective for dynamic architectures in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and
producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

*Dimitrios Bralios,Jonah Casebeer,Paris Smaragdis*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'Re-Bottleneck' framework to modify pre-trained autoencoders, improving latent structure for diverse applications without sacrificing reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural audio codecs and autoencoders focus on reconstruction fidelity but lack tailored latent structures for optimal downstream performance.

Method: Proposes a post-hoc 'Re-Bottleneck' framework, training an inner bottleneck using latent space losses to enforce user-defined structures.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in three experiments: ordering latent channels, aligning latents with semantic embeddings, and introducing equivariance.

Conclusion: The Re-Bottleneck framework flexibly tailors neural audio model representations for varied applications with minimal additional training.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods for ASR models on edge devices, showing 3-bit quantization can work with advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying ASR models on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to memory, compute, and power limits. Quantization, especially PTQ, can help but its performance impact is unclear.

Method: The study evaluates eight SOTA PTQ methods on Whisper and Moonshine ASR models across seven datasets, analyzing accuracy, memory I/O, and bit operations.

Result: Advanced PTQ techniques enable successful 3-bit quantization on high-capacity ASR models, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power edge devices, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced PTQ.

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on
edge devices.

*Anurag Pallaprolu,Winston Hurst,Yasamin Mostofi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel framework uses mmWave radar to extract crowd motion patterns and infer semantics via signal processing, geometric graphs, and flow analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and infer crowd motion patterns and semantics using mmWave radar for applications in crowd analytics.

Method: Combines optical flow estimation with noise filtering to create mmWave flow fields, transforms these into directed geometric graphs, and analyzes local Jacobian for curl and divergence.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction and accurately infers crowd semantics like turns, boundaries, dispersions, and gatherings.

Conclusion: The framework is validated for complex crowd patterns, showing potential for crowd analytics applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in single-slot settings and proposes BundleNet for multi-slot settings, enhancing revenue and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint advertising mechanisms are suboptimal due to their focus on individual advertisers and neglect of bundle structures.

Method: The paper identifies an optimal single-slot mechanism and introduces BundleNet, a neural network approach for multi-slot joint advertising.

Result: BundleNet approximates theoretical results in single-slot settings and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-slot settings, boosting revenue.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms significantly improve platform revenue while maintaining incentive compatibility and rationality.

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

TL;DR: Machine learning models using longitudinal data improve heart transplant waitlist mortality predictions, outperforming previous methods with a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current heart transplant waitlist decisions are ad-hoc. Leveraging UNOS data since 2018, there's a need for analytical tools to aid clinical decisions.

Method: Benchmarked machine learning models using 23,807 patient records with 77 variables for time-to-event modeling of waitlist mortality.

Result: Best model achieved C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, outperforming prior models. Key predictors aligned with known risk factors and revealed new associations.

Conclusion: The models can enhance urgency assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision-making.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical
approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our
best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly
outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors
while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency
assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision making.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Variational Neural Annealing (VNA) to solve portfolio optimization under real-world constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness for large portfolios and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mixed-integer optimizers struggle with portfolio optimization under constraints like turnover limits and transaction costs, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The problem is mapped onto an Ising-like Hamiltonian and solved using VNA, implemented with autoregressive neural networks.

Result: VNA identifies near-optimal solutions for portfolios with over 2,000 assets, matching state-of-the-art optimizers like Mosek but with faster convergence.

Conclusion: VNA shows universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling, making it a promising tool for large-scale portfolio optimization.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

TL;DR: PAOA is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that outperforms QAOA and extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and formalize prior work, enabling efficient sampling on Ising machines and probabilistic computers.

Method: Iteratively modifies couplings of binary stochastic units using cost evaluations from samples, with a variational formulation.

Result: PAOA shows superior performance over QAOA on the 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and improves upon simulated annealing for heavy-tailed problems.

Conclusion: PAOA provides a principled and efficient approach for optimization, extending classical methods like simulated annealing.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

*Francesca Mignacco,Francesco Mori*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified theoretical framework combining statistical physics and control theory to derive optimal learning protocols for neural networks, addressing high-dimensional challenges and offering interpretable strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies is limited due to complex dynamics and high dimensionality, leading to heuristic solutions.

Method: Combines statistical physics with control theory to derive closed-form ODEs for stochastic gradient descent, formulating learning protocol design as an optimal control problem.

Result: Identifies nontrivial, interpretable strategies for optimal protocols, such as curricula and adaptive regularization, and demonstrates applicability to real datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for designing optimal learning protocols and advances a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

TL;DR: An integrated framework combining ANN-based hybrid modeling, MOO, and MCDM optimizes SMR reactors, reducing computational costs and achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and complexity of optimizing SMR reactors with multiple conflicting objectives.

Method: Combines a 1D fixed-bed reactor model with ANN surrogate modeling, MOO (NSGA-II), and MCDM (TOPSIS, sPROBID) for optimization.

Result: Achieved 93.8% reduction in simulation time, high methane conversion (0.863-0.988), and optimal hydrogen output (3.335-4.556 mol/s).

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and effective for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with multiple objectives.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.

Motivation: To highlight the underestimated structural complexity in multicomponent systems compared to statistical mixtures and explore its impact on system behavior.

Result: Multicomponent systems show infinitely greater complexity and emergent hierarchical organization, unlike statistical mixtures.

Conclusion: A new type of structural complexity in multicomponent systems is identified, affecting system ergodicity and requiring further study.

Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much
more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely
more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical
mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent
hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning approach for segmenting carotid artery vessel walls and plaques in multi-sequence MRI data, addressing challenges of limited labeled data and complex morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery plaques in MRI is crucial for assessing atherosclerosis and stroke risk, but complex plaque morphology and scarce labeled data pose challenges.

Method: Proposes a two-network approach: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation, using a multi-level multi-sequence U-Net and semi-supervised learning with input transformations.

Result: Evaluated on 52 patients, the method shows effectiveness, emphasizing fusion strategy importance and achieving expert-validated accuracy.

Conclusion: Fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning improve carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI applications.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

TL;DR: DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network, improves PET-CT lesion segmentation by addressing cancer-specific features and shared knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat all cancers as a single task, ignoring unique characteristics of different cancer types.

Method: DpDNet uses specific and common prompts to capture cancer-specific features and shared knowledge, with prompt-aware heads to handle multiple tasks.

Result: DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models on a PET-CT dataset with four cancer types and aids in survival analysis.

Conclusion: DpDNet shows potential for personalized risk stratification and optimizing treatment strategies.

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

Motivation: Address the need for efficient storage solutions for large imaging datasets due to advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: Used two deep learning architectures (D-CNN and VQ-VAE) with varying compression rates on XCT data from a sandstone sample. Evaluated decoded image quality and introduced an edge-preservation metric.

Result: Different architectures and compression rates are needed based on specific data characteristics. The edge-preservation metric improved decoding quality.

Conclusion: The findings help scientists choose appropriate data storage and analysis strategies based on their needs.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

TL;DR: GridTD is an unsupervised continuous representation framework for compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, combining multi-resolution hash grid encoding and tensor decomposition for efficient and accurate high-dimensional image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised representations for CI reconstruction struggle to balance representation ability and efficiency, limiting their performance.

Method: GridTD optimizes a lightweight neural network and tensor decomposition model using multi-resolution hash grid encoding, leveraging hierarchical modeling and compactness.

Result: GridTD outperforms existing methods in diverse CI tasks (video SCI, spectral SCI, compressive dynamic MRI) and is supported by theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: GridTD is a versatile, state-of-the-art method for CI reconstruction, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A generative framework for synthesizing breast ultrasound (BUS) images using clinical descriptions and structural masks to address data scarcity, enhancing downstream cancer diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of expert-annotated BUS images limits robust deep learning model development.

Method: Proposes a clinically controllable generative framework integrating clinical descriptions and structural masks to synthesize tumors with fine-grained control over characteristics. Includes a semantic-curvature mask generator for diverse tumor masks.

Result: Synthetic images show clinical utility in enhancing breast cancer diagnosis tasks and pass visual Turing tests by sonographers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data scarcity and has potential for broader clinical applications.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

### [305] [MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839)
*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework integrates multimodal data (CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, genomic) to improve recurrence prediction in ccRCC, addressing limitations of single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prognostic models for ccRCC recurrence rely on single data modalities, failing to capture disease complexity, leading to suboptimal accuracy.

Method: The framework uses domain-specific models (CLAM for histopathology, MeD-3D for CT/MRI, MLP for clinical/genomic data) and fuses features via early/late integration, handling incomplete data.

Result: The multimodal DL approach enhances predictive accuracy by combining complementary data sources and accommodating missing modalities.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data types with DL improves ccRCC recurrence prediction, aiding clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

*Abrar Faiyaz,Nhat Hoang,Giovanni Schifitto,Md Nasir Uddin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ArteryX is a MATLAB-based toolbox for quantifying cerebral vascular features from 3D TOF MRA, addressing limitations of existing methods with high accuracy, efficiency, and minimal user intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing cerebral vasculature lack standardized quantitative metrics and face challenges like variability and inefficiency, hindering early detection of subtle vascular changes.

Method: ArteryX uses a semi-supervised, vessel-fused network-based landmarking approach to track and manage tracings, integrating an in-vivo like simulation framework for validation.

Result: Validation showed ArteryX's improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and outperformed existing semi-automated methods, with processing times of ~10-15 minutes per subject.

Conclusion: ArteryX offers a promising tool for clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

### [307] [Wrist bone segmentation in X-ray images using CT-based simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07131)
*Youssef ElTantawy,Alexia Karantana,Xin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning-based method for wrist bone segmentation in X-rays using simulated images from CT volumes to address the challenge of limited annotated data. The method achieves high Dice scores (0.80-0.92) and performs well on real X-ray images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray image segmentation is crucial for diagnostics but lacks annotated data, especially for wrist bones due to their small size and overlap. Deep learning requires large annotated datasets, which are hard to obtain.

Method: The method uses simulated X-ray images generated from CT volumes with bone labels to train a deep learning model for segmenting wrist bones in real X-rays.

Result: The model achieved Dice scores of 0.80-0.92 on simulated data and showed superior performance on real X-ray images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the data annotation challenge and provides a freely available model and simulation code for research.

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A label-efficient strategy for chest X-ray diagnosis using CLIP ViT-B/32 model, achieving 20% improvement in AUC with few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining large labeled medical datasets due to privacy, cost, and scarcity.

Method: Partial fine-tuning of CLIP's visual encoder, evaluated via zero-shot and few-shot learning (1-16 labeled examples per class).

Result: Over 20% improvement in mean AUC score compared to zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, scalable solution for few-shot medical imaging tasks, simulating real-world hospital workflows.

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this
research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not
been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at

*Eric Markley,Henry Pinkard,Leyla Kabuli,Nalini Singh,Laura Waller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: IDEAL-IO improves IDEAL by decoupling density estimation from optical parameter optimization, reducing runtime and memory usage while enabling better designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high memory usage, long runtimes, and mismatched objectives in IDEAL for practical imaging system design.

Method: Introduces IDEAL-IO, alternating between density model fitting and optical parameter optimization for efficiency.

Result: Reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x, enabling superior designs in diverse imaging systems.

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO makes information-theoretic optimization practical and scalable for real-world imaging design.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.

### [310] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for generative panoramic image stitching using diffusion-based inpainting to create seamless panoramas from multiple reference images with parallax and lighting variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stitching fails with parallax and lighting variations; generative models struggle with large coherent regions.

Method: Fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve scene content and layout, then outpaints a panorama from one reference.

Result: Outperforms baselines in image quality, structure consistency, and scene layout on captured datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively synthesizes seamless panoramas from challenging reference images.

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SD-GS is a compact dynamic Gaussian splatting framework that reduces storage costs and improves motion modeling for dynamic scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between storage costs and motion complexity in current 4D Gaussian frameworks.

Method: Uses a deformable anchor grid for efficient scene representation and a deformation-aware densification strategy for adaptive modeling.

Result: Achieves 60% smaller model size and 100% higher FPS while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: SD-GS significantly enhances efficiency and visual quality for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in matting algorithms for capture stage content, proposes a guideline for practitioners, and demonstrates an efficient pipeline for adapting state-of-the-art methods without extensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matting algorithms struggle with capture stage content, necessitating insights and solutions for improved workflows.

Method: Proposes a curated list of challenges, a guideline for practitioners, and an efficient pipeline for adapting existing methods. Includes a validation methodology using a diffusion model.

Result: Demonstrates improved workflow and adaptation of state-of-the-art methods without extensive annotations.

Conclusion: The work provides actionable insights and solutions for matting in capture stage content, validated by a diffusion model.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

TL;DR: RTR-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for reflective objects by decomposing BRDF and lighting, using a hybrid rendering model to enhance novel view synthesis and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rendering reflective objects in 3DGS is challenging, especially for inverse rendering and relighting.

Method: Combines forward and deferred rendering to recover geometry, separates high/low-frequency appearances, and refines BRDF/lighting decomposition with physically-based deferred rendering.

Result: Enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: RTR-GS effectively addresses challenges in rendering reflective objects, offering robust decomposition and credible relighting results.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

*Jean-Baptiste Fermanian,Mohamed Hebiri,Joseph Salmon*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined conformal prediction method for classification tasks with multi-inputs, ensuring smaller predictive label sets while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by citizen science applications like Pl@ntNet, where multiple images of the same instance (e.g., plant) are available, the method aims to improve uncertainty quantification.

Method: The approach aggregates conformal p-values from each observation in a multi-input, leveraging their exact distribution and a general scoring framework.

Result: The method reduces predictive label set size without compromising coverage guarantees, validated on simulated and real data (e.g., Pl@ntNet).

Conclusion: The refined conformal prediction method effectively handles multi-input scenarios, enhancing practical applications like citizen science.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

TL;DR: Machine learning pipelines using unreduced persistence diagrams (PDs) can match or outperform those using fully-reduced PDs, suggesting computational and performance benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent homology features often ignore much information in persistence diagrams, despite their high computational cost. This study explores whether unreduced boundary matrices can provide comparable or better performance.

Method: Introduced methods to generate topological feature vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. Compared pipelines trained on unreduced vs. fully-reduced PDs across various data and tasks.

Result: Models trained on unreduced PDs performed on par or better than those on fully-reduced PDs in some tasks.

Conclusion: Utilizing unreduced boundary matrices may improve computational efficiency and performance in topology-based machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores double descent in over-parameterized models from a Bayesian perspective, showing it aligns with Occam's razor while explaining risk behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand double descent in over-parameterized models (e.g., deep neural networks) through Bayesian interpretation and reconcile it with Occam's razor.

Method: Analyze risk characteristics of over-parameterized models, provide Bayesian interpretation, and illustrate with Bayesian model selection in neural networks.

Result: Double descent has a natural Bayesian explanation and doesn't conflict with Occam's razor, as simpler models are still preferred when possible.

Conclusion: The study bridges double descent and Bayesian principles, suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces second-order proposals in SMC², leveraging Hessian information for improved posterior approximation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational demands and improve accuracy in SMC² by incorporating second-order information (Hessian) for better proposal design.

Method: Extend SMC² with second-order proposals using the Hessian of the log-target, building on MALA's gradient-based approach.

Result: Experiments show benefits in step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy compared to other proposals.

Conclusion: Second-order proposals in SMC² enhance performance, offering a promising direction for Bayesian inference in HPC environments.

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

Motivation: ARIMA models are limited by linear assumptions and high computational costs in complex datasets. The paper aims to generalize ARIMA to capture nonlinear dependencies efficiently.

Method: Proposes Galerkin-ARIMA, replacing the AR component with a spline-based function estimated by Galerkin projection. Derives a closed-form OLS estimator for the coefficients.

Result: The model is asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions, bridging classical time-series and nonparametric regression.

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA improves forecasting performance and computational efficiency, generalizing ARIMA for nonlinear dependencies.

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which

*Shuying Huang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A general N-tuples learning framework is proposed, unifying data generation and empirical risk minimization, with theoretical guarantees and practical applications in weakly-supervised scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified theoretical foundation in existing N-tuples learning methods and reduce annotation burden in supervised learning.

Method: Proposes a framework based on empirical risk minimization, unifying N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a probabilistic formulation, and introduces correction functions to mitigate overfitting.

Result: The framework generalizes existing models, provides theoretical error bounds, and improves generalization in experiments across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates pointwise unlabeled data, enhancing N-tuples learning performance with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

TL;DR: FedP3E is a novel federated learning framework addressing privacy and data heterogeneity in IoT malware detection by sharing perturbed class prototypes instead of raw data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sensitive nature of IoT data and the limitations of standard FL methods in handling class imbalance and non-IID data distributions motivate the need for a privacy-preserving and resilient detection framework.

Method: FedP3E uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to create class-wise prototypes, perturbs them with noise, and shares these summaries. It integrates SMOTE-based augmentation for minority classes.

Result: FedP3E reduces the impact of statistical heterogeneity with minimal communication overhead, as demonstrated on the N-BaIoT dataset.

Conclusion: FedP3E effectively enhances IoT malware detection by enabling indirect representation sharing while preserving privacy and addressing data imbalance.

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

*Nishit V. Pandya,Andrey Labunets,Sicun Gao,Earlence Fernandes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of prompt injection defenses in LLMs, demonstrating their vulnerability to optimization-based attacks, with success rates up to 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of existing defenses against prompt injection attacks in LLMs, particularly in whitebox settings.

Method: Constructs a novel attention-based attack algorithm and tests it on two recent defenses (SecAlign and StruQ).

Result: Attacks achieved up to 70% success rates with minimal additional token costs.

Conclusion: Existing defenses lack robustness in whitebox settings, highlighting the need for more secure solutions.

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release
our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks

*Jikesh Thapa,Gurrehmat Chahal,Serban Voinea Gabreanu,Yazan Otoum*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper compares ML, DL, and quantized LLMs for phishing detection, finding LLMs promising for context-based cues but underperforming in raw accuracy. It highlights cost-efficient deployment and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of phishing attacks demands detection systems balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Comparative evaluation of ML, DL, and quantized LLMs on a curated dataset, including zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies.

Result: LLMs show potential for subtle phishing cues but underperform in raw accuracy. Lightweight LLMs achieve competitive accuracy (above 80%) with 17GB VRAM.

Conclusion: Optimized LLMs are promising for phishing defense, offering explainable, efficient AI integration into cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

*Mohammad F. Al-Hammouri,Yazan Otoum,Rasha Atwa,Amiya Nayak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A hybrid IDS combining signature-based methods with GPT-2's semantic analysis improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber threats are evolving, especially in IoT environments, requiring adaptive IDSs. Traditional methods fail against new attacks, while GPT-2 excels at identifying complex patterns.

Method: Proposes a hybrid IDS framework integrating signature-based techniques with GPT-2's semantic analysis.

Result: Improves detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains real-time responsiveness.

Conclusion: GPT-2 integration enhances IDS intelligence, scalability, and resilience for modern cybersecurity needs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

### [325] [Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871)
*Toluwani Aremu,Noor Hussein,Munachiso Nwadike,Samuele Poppi,Jie Zhang,Karthik Nandakumar,Neil Gong,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-key extension to mitigate watermark stealing attacks in GenAI, ensuring content provenance without relying on the watermark's internal details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat of watermark stealing attacks, where users forge watermarks into non-provider-generated content, potentially harming GenAI providers.

Method: Introduces a multi-key extension applicable to any watermarking method, treating the watermark as a black-box. Theoretical and empirical validation is provided.

Result: Demonstrates reduced effectiveness of forging attacks across datasets, with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The multi-key approach effectively mitigates watermark stealing, enhancing security for GenAI providers.

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

*Youqian Zhang,Xinyu Ji,Zhihao Wang,Qinhong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores electromagnetic signal injection attacks on CMOS image sensors, causing rainbow-like artifacts that disrupt object detection models, revealing a critical vulnerability in visual perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image sensors are crucial for safety- and security-critical systems, but their analog domain is vulnerable to undetected manipulation, posing risks to decision-making processes.

Method: The study investigates electromagnetic interference attacks on CMOS image sensors, analyzing induced color artifacts and their impact on object detection models.

Result: The attacks cause significant mispredictions in object detection models, exposing a previously undocumented vulnerability in the visual perception pipeline.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for robust defenses against physical-layer attacks to secure image sensor-based systems.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

### [1] [Post-Disaster Affected Area Segmentation with a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based EVAP Model using Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16849)
*Yi-Shan Chu,Hsuan-Cheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A ViT-based framework that uses weakly supervised learning with PCA feature analysis and confidence indexing to improve disaster-affected area segmentation from satellite imagery, demonstrated on drought and wildfire cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Taiwan Space Agency's Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) for disaster mapping by addressing the challenge of limited manual annotations and improving segmentation accuracy when ground truth data is scarce.

Method: Vision Transformer (ViT)-based encoder-decoder architecture with: (1) PCA-based feature space analysis for label expansion, (2) confidence index construction for weakly supervised training set generation, (3) multi-band inputs from Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery, and (4) multiple decoder variants with multi-stage loss strategies.

Result: Demonstrated improved smoothness and reliability of disaster area segmentation on two case studies: 2022 Poyang Lake drought and 2023 Rhodes wildfire. The framework showed better spatial coherence and segmentation consistency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ViT-based framework provides a scalable approach for disaster mapping that effectively handles limited supervision scenarios, offering enhanced segmentation quality for emergency response applications when accurate ground truth is unavailable.

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

### [2] [Toward a Real-Time Framework for Accurate Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16850)
*Mohamed Adjel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting that uses camera intrinsics and anatomical priors to enable fast, personalized 3D human pose estimation from monocular images without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenging and ill-posed, especially in real-time and unconstrained environments. Direct image-to-3D approaches require large datasets and heavy models, while existing solutions lack the flexibility needed for deployment on edge devices in real-world scenarios.

Method: The framework combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. It builds on self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets.

Result: The approach enables fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware, offering a lightweight and flexible alternative to direct image-to-3D methods.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates how bridging data-driven learning with model-based priors can improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture systems for edge devices in unconstrained environments.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

### [3] [Coarse-to-fine crack cue for robust crack detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16851)
*Zelong Liu,Yuliang Gu,Zhichao Sun,Huachao Zhu,Xin Xiao,Bo Du,Laurent Najman,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue is a novel coarse-to-fine method that leverages the thin structure property of cracks to generate robust crack cues, significantly improving generalization and robustness of existing crack detection networks across different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based crack detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen domains despite good in-dataset performance, and previous methods overlook the important thin structure property of cracks that could be leveraged for more robust detection.

Method: A coarse-to-fine crack cue generation approach that uses max-pooling and upsampling to create a coarse crack-free background, then employs a reconstruction network to obtain a fine crack-free background. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a robust crack cue that can be integrated as a plug-and-play component into existing crack detection networks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of three advanced crack detection baseline methods, with the fine crack cue being unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadows, and varied lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed CrackCue method successfully addresses the domain generalization problem in crack detection by exploiting the thin structure property of cracks to generate robust crack priors, and serves as an effective plug-and-play enhancement for existing crack detection networks.

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

### [4] [CLAMP: Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Fusion for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16854)
*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLAMP, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis that uses progressive attention fusion, multi-task contrastive learning, and adaptive multi-loss aggregation to better align text and image features while identifying aspect terms and their sentiment polarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MABSA methods suffer from cross-modal alignment noise and insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. Global modality alignment methods often overlook connections between aspect terms and corresponding local visual regions, creating a representation gap between text and images that needs to be bridged.

Method: The paper introduces CLAMP framework with three key modules: (1) Progressive Attention Fusion network for hierarchical multi-stage cross-modal interactions to enhance fine-grained text-image alignment, (2) Multi-task Contrastive Learning combining global modal contrast and local granularity alignment for cross-modal representation consistency, and (3) Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation using dynamic uncertainty-based weighting to calibrate loss contributions and mitigate gradient interference.

Result: CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art methods on standard public benchmarks for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAMP framework effectively addresses the challenges in MABSA by improving cross-modal alignment through progressive attention mechanisms, enhancing representation consistency via contrastive learning, and optimizing training through adaptive loss aggregation, leading to superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

### [5] [SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856)
*Youngjin Na,Sangheon Jeong,Youngwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that detects and mitigates harmful intent in vision-language models by using a three-stage reasoning process to identify latent risks from combined image-text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face new safety risks where seemingly innocuous images and text can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe responses. Existing safety approaches using post hoc filtering or static refusal prompts struggle to detect these latent risks that emerge only from input combinations.

Method: SIA employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning to understand image content, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to identify potential harmful intent, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement to generate safer outputs. The framework dynamically adapts to implicit intent inferred from image-text pairs without relying on predefined rules or classifiers.

Result: SIA achieves substantial safety improvements and outperforms prior methods on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe. However, it shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar benchmark.

Conclusion: SIA demonstrates the value of intent-aware reasoning in aligning vision-language models with human-centric values. The safety gains achieved through proactive intent detection outweigh the minor trade-off in general reasoning performance, highlighting the importance of considering implicit harmful intent in multimodal safety.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

### [6] [Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16861)
*Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve LiDAR-camera fusion for autonomous vehicle perception by addressing misalignment issues through 2D object priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with 71.5% mAP and 73.6% NDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-camera fusion methods suffer from misalignment between modalities due to projection errors from calibration inaccuracies and LiDAR rolling shutter effects. These errors are concentrated at object-background boundaries, leading to inaccurate depth supervision and erroneous feature fusion.

Method: The paper introduces three key components: (1) Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC) that uses 2D object priors to correct local misalignment, (2) Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to process calibrated results and enhance object-background transitions, and (3) Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM) with gated attention mechanism for efficient fusion of aligned depth and image features.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset with mean Average Precision (mAP) of 71.5% and nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) of 73.6%, demonstrating improved 3D perception capabilities for autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: By leveraging 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features and addressing both local and global misalignment issues, the method successfully enhances LiDAR-camera fusion for Bird's-Eye-View representation, leading to superior 3D perception performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

*Hongcheng Gao,Zihao Huang,Lin Xu,Jingyi Tang,Xinhao Li,Yue Liu,Haoyang Li,Taihang Hu,Minhua Lin,Xinlong Yang,Ge Wu,Balong Bi,Hongyu Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET), a perception-focused benchmark that reveals catastrophic failures in state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual tasks that humans find trivial, highlighting a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent research has focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can MLLMs truly perceive the world as humans do? The authors shift focus from reasoning to perception to address this gap in understanding MLLMs' perceptual capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. They test various approaches including in-context learning, training on language backbone, and fine-tuning the vision tower.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on perceptual tasks that are trivial for humans. In-context learning and training on language backbone fail to improve performance, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation. This suggests the benchmark challenges vision tower generalization rather than language backbone capabilities.

Conclusion: The study reveals a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception, specifically in vision tower generalization capabilities rather than knowledge and reasoning abilities. The findings suggest that improving visual perception in MLLMs requires focusing on the vision component rather than the language backbone.

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

### [8] [HIPPO-Video: Simulating Watch Histories with Large Language Models for Personalized Video Highlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16873)
*Jeongeun Lee,Youngjae Yu,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for personalized video highlighting with 2,040 watch history-saliency pairs across 20,400 videos, and proposes HiPHer method that uses personalized watch histories to predict user-specific video segment importance, outperforming existing generic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack personalization and rely on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the complexity of user behavior and preferences. With exponential growth of video content, there's a critical need for personalized video highlighting systems that can adapt to highly variable and complex user preferences.

Method: The authors create HIPPO-Video dataset using an LLM-based user simulator to generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. They then propose HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores for video highlighting.

Result: The HIPPO-Video dataset contains 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs covering 20,400 videos across 170 semantic categories. Through extensive experiments, the proposed HiPHer method outperforms existing generic and query-based approaches for video highlighting tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates that incorporating personalized watch histories significantly improves video highlighting performance compared to generic approaches, showcasing the potential for highly user-centric video highlighting systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

### [9] [ReMeREC: Relation-aware and Multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16877)
*Yizhi Hu,Zezhao Tian,Xingqun Qi,Chen Su,Bingkun Yang,Junhui Yin,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReMeREC, a framework for multi-entity referring expression comprehension that models inter-entity relationships, along with a new dataset ReMeX containing detailed relationship annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring expression comprehension methods focus on single-entity localization and ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, which limits their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, there's a lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained paired image-text-relation annotations.

Method: The authors propose ReMeREC framework with two key components: (1) Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) that dynamically infers entity quantity and span from textual cues, and (2) Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) for enhanced relational reasoning. They also construct ReMeX dataset with detailed relationship annotations and EntityText auxiliary dataset using large language models.

Result: ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing approaches in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ReMeREC framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by jointly modeling visual and textual cues for multi-entity localization while considering inter-entity relationships, demonstrating substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

### [10] [CausalStep: A Benchmark for Explicit Stepwise Causal Reasoning in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16878)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalStep is a new benchmark for evaluating stepwise causal reasoning in videos, featuring 100 videos with 1,852 QA pairs that require sequential understanding rather than exploiting global context, revealing significant gaps between current LLMs and human-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks only assess shallow understanding and allow models to exploit global context, failing to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning capabilities in large language models, despite advances in text and image reasoning.

Method: The researchers created CausalStep by segmenting videos into causally linked units and implementing a strict stepwise question-answer protocol that requires sequential answers. They included carefully constructed distractors based on error type taxonomy and developed seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation across 100 videos in six categories.

Result: Experiments with leading proprietary and open-source models, along with human baselines, demonstrated a significant performance gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning capabilities in video understanding.

Conclusion: CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark that can drive progress toward more robust and interpretable video reasoning by properly evaluating causal understanding rather than allowing shortcut solutions through global context exploitation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

### [11] [Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Less Local Than Assumed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880)
*Antoni Kowalczuk,Dominik Hintersdorf,Lukas Struppek,Kristian Kersting,Adam Dziedzic,Franziska Boenisch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes critical vulnerabilities in existing pruning-based defenses against data memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, showing that minor prompt adjustments can re-trigger replication even after pruning, and proposes an adversarial fine-tuning approach as a more robust solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models raise serious concerns about data privacy and intellectual property due to their tendency to memorize and replicate training data. While recent mitigation efforts have focused on pruning weights to prevent replication, the robustness and effectiveness of these approaches remain questionable, necessitating a thorough evaluation of their limitations.

Method: The paper evaluates pruning-based defenses by testing their robustness against minor text embedding adjustments that can re-trigger data replication. The authors challenge the assumption of memorization locality by demonstrating replication from diverse locations in the embedding space. They introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness against memorization.

Result: The study reveals that existing pruning-based defenses are fragile and can be easily bypassed with minor prompt modifications. The research demonstrates that memorization is not localized but can be triggered from multiple locations within the text embedding space through different model pathways, fundamentally challenging current mitigation assumptions.

Conclusion: Current pruning-based mitigation strategies are insufficient for preventing data memorization in text-to-image diffusion models. The findings emphasize the need for methods that truly remove memorized content rather than merely suppressing its retrieval. The proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach provides a foundation for developing more trustworthy and compliant generative AI systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

*Nima Fathi,Amar Kumar,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURA is the first visual linguistic explainability agent for medical imaging that transforms static AI predictions into interactive decision support through dynamic interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agentic systems show promise across many domains, but their application to medical imaging remains underdeveloped. There is a need to move beyond static prediction systems toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically aligned AI systems that can provide interactive decision support for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: AURA demonstrates the transformative potential of agentic AI in medical imaging by shifting from static predictions to interactive decision support systems, offering improved transparency, adaptability, and clinical alignment for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced

### [14] [Toward Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection through Class-Agnostic Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16946)
*Chiao-An Yang,Kuan-Chuan Peng,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection (LTOAD), a class-agnostic framework that addresses anomaly detection in realistic settings with imbalanced data distributions and online learning constraints, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to realistic scenarios that combine long-tailed data distributions with online learning requirements. Current long-tailed anomaly detection (LTAD) methods are class-aware and require class labels, making them unsuitable for online settings where such information is unavailable.

Method: The authors propose a class-agnostic framework for long-tailed anomaly detection that can be adapted to online learning settings. This approach eliminates the need for class labels while maintaining effectiveness in handling imbalanced data distributions during continuous learning.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most offline LTAD settings across industrial manufacturing and medical domains, achieving +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec compared to methods with access to class labels. In the challenging long-tailed online setting, it achieves +0.53% image-AUROC improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed class-agnostic framework successfully addresses the novel challenge of long-tailed online anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance in both offline and online settings while removing the dependency on class label information that limits existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

### [15] [Divisive Decisions: Improving Salience-Based Training for Generalization in Binary Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17000)
*Jacob Piland,Chris Sweet,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class class activation maps (CAMs) to improve deep learning model generalization, showing superior performance over traditional approaches that only use true-class CAMs across multiple binary classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency-guided training methods only consider the model's class activation map for the correct label class, ignoring the false-class CAMs. The authors hypothesize that in binary tasks, true and false CAMs should diverge on important classification features identified by humans, which can be leveraged to improve model training.

Method: The paper introduces three new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class CAMs into the training strategy, along with a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. These methods compare model CAMs against human reference saliency maps during training.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional saliency-guided training approaches across several diverse binary classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric presentation attack detection, and chest X-ray anomaly classification in both close-set and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating both true-class and false-class CAMs in saliency-guided training significantly enhances model generalization over methods that only use true-class CAMs, with the authors providing source codes and model weights to support reproducible research.

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

*Gaston Gustavo Rios,Pedro Dal Bianco,Franco Ronchetti,Facundo Quiroga,Oscar Stanchi,Santiago Ponte Ahón,Waldo Hasperué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of limited and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets by using synthetic data generation with GANs (ReACGAN and SPADE) to augment training data, achieving 5% improvement in classification accuracy on the RWTH German sign language dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced, which poses significant challenges for effective model training. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by exploring synthetic data generation to augment training datasets.

Method: The authors use an EfficientNet classifier trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset and compare two GAN architectures: (1) ReACGAN - uses label information to condition data generation through an auxiliary classifier, and (2) SPADE - utilizes spatially-adaptive normalization to condition generation on pose information. They apply different strategies to combine generated and real images for training.

Result: The proposed techniques improve state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%. The method demonstrates generalization capability across different sign language datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID dataset, achieving comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers without requiring generator retraining.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using GANs (ReACGAN and SPADE) effectively addresses the limitations of small and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets. The approach not only improves classification accuracy but also shows promising generalization capabilities across different datasets, providing a viable solution for enhancing sign language recognition systems.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Decoupled-PolyGCN, a deep learning approach using Graph Convolutional Networks to automatically extract building footprints from satellite imagery, achieving 6% improvement in AP and 10% in AR over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of satellites generates vast high-resolution visual data for mapping applications, but reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery remains challenging due to the complexity of creating accurate primitive-based object representations. Current high-quality spatial mapping relies heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a novel deep learning methodology using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates geometric regularity into building boundaries, integrates multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and embeds Attraction Field Maps into the network architecture for building footprint reconstruction from single satellite images.

Result: The proposed Decoupled-PolyGCN model outperforms existing methods by 6% in Average Precision (AP) and 10% in Average Recall (AR), demonstrating superior performance in delivering accurate and regularized building footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from satellite imagery, with potential applications in urban planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis, addressing the persistent challenge of primitives-based object representation in computer vision.

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

### [18] [Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047)
*Kuleen Sasse,Efsun Sarioglu Kayi,Arun Reddy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a video understanding system that converts long-form videos into text-based memory using progressive captioning, enabling LLMs to answer complex queries about video content more efficiently than processing raw video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos are extremely dense and high-dimensional, making them computationally challenging to process directly. Text-based summaries provide a compact representation that can be easily processed by LLMs for complex reasoning and question-answering tasks.

Method: The system uses LaViLa video captioner to progressively build text-based memory from video chunks, incorporates static scene descriptions using LLaVA VLM to enrich captions beyond just human actions, explores video partitioning strategies for better content structure representation, and develops a controllable hybrid captioner that can produce both action and scene captions based on input tokens.

Result: The enhanced captioning pipeline produces more detailed and complete caption logs that expand the range of answerable questions. The fine-tuned controllable hybrid captioner significantly improves efficiency compared to using separate models for action and scene captioning, and can switch between caption types based on detected scene changes.

Conclusion: The proposed video understanding system successfully addresses the computational challenges of long-form video processing by creating enriched text-based representations that enable effective LLM-based reasoning and question-answering, with improved efficiency through the unified hybrid captioning approach.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

TL;DR: VideoNarrator is a training-free pipeline that generates dense video captions with precise timestamps by combining multiple MLLMs and VLMs to reduce hallucinations and improve temporal alignment in video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with temporally aligned video narrations and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios, creating a need for better video captioning solutions.

Method: A flexible training-free pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models functioning as caption generators, context providers, and caption verifiers in a synergistic approach.

Result: The synergistic interaction of pipeline components significantly enhances video narration quality and accuracy, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving temporal alignment compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VideoNarrator provides a structured approach that enhances video understanding and facilitates downstream tasks like video summarization and question answering, with potential extensions to advertising and marketing applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

*Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Kendall N. Niles,Joe Tom,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Elias Ioup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey examines few-shot learning (FSL) advances for video and 3D object detection, showing how FSL can reduce expensive annotation requirements by enabling models to recognize novel classes from just a few examples through techniques like temporal matching and specialized point cloud networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data labeling for object detection is expensive and time-consuming, especially for video (where objects need annotation across frames) and 3D data (requiring costly 3D annotations). FSL offers a solution by enabling models to detect new classes with minimal annotated examples, making real-world deployment more practical.

Method: The paper surveys FSL techniques across two domains: (1) Video detection using tube proposals and temporal matching networks that leverage spatiotemporal structure across frames, and (2) 3D detection integrating FSL with specialized point cloud networks and losses designed for class imbalance, addressing challenges like data sparsity and lack of texture in LiDAR/depth data.

Result: FSL demonstrates effectiveness in both video and 3D object detection by efficiently leveraging information across different modalities (feature, temporal, and data modalities). The techniques show promise for reducing annotation requirements while maintaining detection performance, particularly benefiting autonomous driving applications where 3D annotation costs are prohibitive.

Conclusion: FSL shows significant promise for reducing supervision needs in real-world applications by enabling efficient detection of novel classes with minimal examples. Key challenges remain in balancing generalization vs. overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and handling domain-specific data properties, but FSL represents a viable path toward practical deployment across video, 3D, and other challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

*Zaipeng Duan,Chenxu Dang,Xuzhong Hu,Pei An,Junfeng Ding,Jie Zhan,Yunbiao Xu,Jie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDG-OCC is a novel multimodal 3D occupancy prediction network that combines camera and LiDAR data through joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation with fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation, achieving state-of-the-art real-time performance on autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing occupancy prediction methods are limited by single-modality approaches: camera-based methods lack depth information while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods using Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and fail to fully exploit geometric and semantic information from 3D LiDAR points.

Method: The paper proposes SDG-OCC with two key components: (1) Enhanced view transformation that constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization, and (2) Fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation that extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Two variants are introduced: SDG-Fusion (fusion only) and SDG-KL (fusion + distillation for faster inference).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across different scenarios.

Conclusion: SDG-OCC successfully addresses the limitations of single-modality occupancy prediction by effectively combining camera and LiDAR data through novel view transformation and active distillation techniques, achieving superior performance while maintaining real-time processing capabilities for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedVLM, a federated learning framework for fine-tuning vision-language models using personalized LoRA (pLoRA) to handle data heterogeneity across decentralized clients, achieving 24.5% improvement over standard LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show great zero-shot capabilities but fine-tuning them at scale in federated environments is challenging due to decentralized, non-iid data across clients. Existing parameter-efficient methods like LoRA struggle with heterogeneous client data, leading to poor generalization.

Method: The authors propose FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework with personalized LoRA (pLoRA) that dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each client's unique data distribution while enabling decentralized adaptation and preserving model privacy.

Result: Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset demonstrate that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% compared to standard LoRA, showing superior adaptation in non-iid federated settings.

Conclusion: FedVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning vision-language models in federated settings, successfully advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios while maintaining privacy and handling data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a

*Shanshan Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Qi Zhang,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IONext, a CNN-based inertial odometry backbone that uses Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) and Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) to capture both global and local motion features, outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer and CNN methods on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Transformers excel at long-range dependencies in inertial odometry, they have limited sensitivity to local motion variations and lack inherent inductive biases, hindering localization accuracy. Existing CNN approaches also have limitations in temporal modeling for motion feature extraction.

Method: The authors propose IONext with two key components: (1) Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) that adaptively captures global motion patterns and local fine-grained features through dynamically generated selective weights for multi-scale feature aggregation, and (2) Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) that selectively extracts representative motion features in the temporal domain to improve temporal modeling.

Result: IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer and CNN-based methods across six public datasets. Specifically, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 10% and average Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based IONext backbone effectively addresses the limitations of both Transformer and CNN approaches in inertial odometry by combining adaptive multi-scale feature aggregation with improved temporal modeling, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,

### [25] [ScSAM: Debiasing Morphology and Distributional Variability in Subcellular Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17149)
*Bo Fang,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Hang Chang,Gerald J. Shami,Filip Braet,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScSAM enhances subcellular organelle segmentation by combining pre-trained SAM with MAE-guided cellular prior knowledge to address morphological variability and training bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance through feature alignment and class-specific prompt encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subcellular organelle segmentation faces challenges due to significant morphological and distributional variability among components, leading to biased feature learning in existing methods. SAM, while providing rich features, struggles with subcellular scenarios due to label space gaps and insufficient fine-grained spatial detail capture for subtle structural alterations.

Method: The paper introduces ScSAM, which fuses pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge. Key components include: (1) a feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same feature space and combine different representations, and (2) a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate class-specific features for subcellular category recognition.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in organelle segmentation tasks, showing improved feature robustness and reduced training bias from data imbalance.

Conclusion: ScSAM successfully addresses the challenges of subcellular organelle segmentation by leveraging the combination of SAM's global contextual understanding with MAE-guided cellular prior knowledge, resulting in enhanced feature robustness and superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [26] [UNICE: Training A Universal Image Contrast Enhancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17157)
*Ruodai Cui,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UNICE, a universal image contrast enhancement method that generates multi-exposure sequences from single images and fuses them to achieve better generalization across different contrast enhancement tasks without requiring manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are task-specific and show poor generalization across different tasks and datasets. There is a need for a universal model that can handle various contrast enhancement scenarios effectively.

Method: The authors collect 46,928 HDR raw images and render 328,496 sRGB images to create multi-exposure sequences (MES) with pseudo ground-truths via multi-exposure fusion. They train two networks: one to generate MES from single sRGB images, and another to fuse the generated MES into enhanced images.

Result: UNICE demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing methods across different contrast enhancement tasks, outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image quality metrics, all without requiring costly human labeling.

Conclusion: The proposed UNICE method successfully addresses the generalization problem in image contrast enhancement by leveraging HDR data and multi-exposure fusion, providing a universal solution that works across various enhancement tasks without manual annotation requirements.

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

### [27] [DOOMGAN:High-Fidelity Dynamic Identity Obfuscation Ocular Generative Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17158)
*Bharath Krishnamurthy,Ajita Rattani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DOOMGAN, a novel GAN-based approach for generating morphing attacks on visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, achieving significantly higher attack success rates and better preservation of ocular anatomy compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While morphing attacks have been extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face biometrics, morphing attacks on visible-spectrum ocular data remain underexplored. Existing methods struggle to handle uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris boundaries and periocular textures, creating a security vulnerability in biometric systems.

Method: The authors propose DOOMGAN, which incorporates three key components: (1) landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy to capture structural features, (2) attention-guided generation mechanisms for realistic morph synthesis, and (3) dynamic weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized model convergence during training.

Result: DOOMGAN demonstrates superior performance with over 20% higher attack success rates compared to baseline methods under stringent thresholds. Additionally, it achieves 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30% improved gaze consistency. The authors also release the first comprehensive ocular morphing dataset.

Conclusion: DOOMGAN successfully addresses the gap in visible-spectrum ocular morphing attacks by providing a robust generation model that preserves anatomical details while achieving high attack success rates. The release of a comprehensive dataset will support future research in ocular biometric security.

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.

### [28] [Multi-Scale PCB Defect Detection with YOLOv8 Network Improved via Pruning and Lightweight Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17176)
*Li Pingzhen,Xu Sheng,Chen Jing,Su Chengyue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves YOLOv8 for PCB defect detection by implementing a multi-scale approach with tiny target sensitivity, network lightweighting, and adaptive pruning, achieving 99.32% mAP0.5 and 75.18% mAP0.5:0.9 on PCB defect datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCB defect detection models struggle to balance accuracy and computational cost for high-speed production requirements, particularly failing to meet demands for high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects in high-density PCB designs.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive strategy improving YOLOv8 through: 1) Ghost-HGNetv2 backbone with fewer parameters for semantic feature extraction, 2) C2f-Faster integration in neck section for enhanced multi-level feature fusion, 3) GCDetect detection head using GroupConv weight sharing for regression and classification, 4) Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function for improved tiny target detection, and 5) optimized adaptive pruning to reduce model complexity.

Result: The improved model achieves mAP0.5 of 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 of 75.18% on publicly available PCB defect datasets, representing a 10.13% improvement compared to YOLOv8n while maintaining superior speed and accuracy performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale PCB defect detection method successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements in both detection performance and speed for tiny defect detection in high-density PCB manufacturing environments.

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.

### [29] [Hierarchical Fusion and Joint Aggregation: A Multi-Level Feature Representation Method for AIGC Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17182)
*Linghe Meng,Jiarun Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-level visual representation paradigm for AI-generated content quality assessment, developing two networks (MGLF-Net and MPEF-Net) that combine CNN and Transformer features at different levels to better evaluate both perceptual quality and text-to-image correspondence in AIGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIGC quality assessment methods rely on single-level visual features, which limits their ability to capture complex distortions spanning from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic understanding in AI-generated images.

Method: A multi-level visual representation paradigm with three stages: (1) multi-level feature extraction using dual CNN and Transformer backbones, (2) hierarchical fusion combining local and global features, and (3) joint aggregation for final evaluation. Two specific networks are developed: MGLF-Net for perceptual quality assessment and MPEF-Net for text-to-image correspondence evaluation with embedded prompt semantics.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate outstanding performance on both perceptual quality assessment and text-to-image correspondence evaluation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The multi-level visual assessment paradigm effectively addresses the limitations of single-level feature methods by capturing complex distortions across different semantic levels, providing a comprehensive solution for AIGC quality assessment that spans both low-level visual perception and high-level semantic understanding.

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.

*M. A. Rasel,Sameem Abdul Kareem,Zhenli Kwan,Nik Aimee Azizah Faheem,Winn Hui Han,Rebecca Kai Jan Choong,Shin Shen Yong,Unaizah Obaidellah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops automated methods to analyze lesion shape asymmetry in dermoscopic images for melanoma diagnosis, using both geometry-based algorithms and CNN-SVM classification to achieve high accuracy in detecting asymmetric lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asymmetric lesion shape is a critical clinical criterion for melanoma diagnosis in dermoscopic images, but non-experts need automated assistance to understand and apply these asymmetry criteria for accurate skin disease assessment.

Method: The authors first labeled a non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical assessments, then developed a supervised learning image processing algorithm for geometrical pattern analysis, and finally used a pre-trained CNN to extract features (shape, color, texture) for training a multiclass SVM classifier.

Result: The geometry-based approach achieved 99.00% detection rate for asymmetric dermatological lesions, while the CNN-based method achieved 94% Kappa Score, 95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesions into three categories (Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

Conclusion: The proposed dual approach successfully automates asymmetric lesion detection in dermoscopic images, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and providing valuable assistance to non-experts in melanoma diagnosis through accurate shape classification.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

### [31] [Vec2Face+ for Face Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17192)
*Haiyu Wu,Jaskirat Singh,Sicong Tian,Liang Zheng,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vec2Face+, a generative model that creates synthetic face recognition training datasets by generating images from feature vectors while maintaining identity consistency and proper attribute variation, achieving state-of-the-art performance that surpasses real-world datasets like CASIA-WebFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face synthesis methods for training data generation focus on inter-class separability and intra-class attribute variation but overlook the critical need to maintain intra-class identity consistency, leading to suboptimal synthetic datasets for face recognition training.

Method: The authors propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that creates images directly from image features with three key strategies: 1) sampling sufficiently different vectors to generate well-separated identities, 2) AttrOP algorithm for increasing general attribute variations, and 3) LoRA-based pose control for efficient and identity-preserving profile head pose generation.

Result: Vec2Face+ generates VFace10K (10K identities), VFace100K, and VFace300K datasets that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. The synthetic datasets outperform the real-world CASIA-WebFace dataset on five test sets, marking the first time a synthetic dataset beats CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. However, only 1 out of 11 synthetic datasets performs better than random guessing in twin verification.

Conclusion: Vec2Face+ successfully demonstrates that properly designed synthetic face datasets can outperform real-world training data in face recognition tasks. However, the study reveals important limitations including poor performance in twin verification and increased bias in models trained with synthetic identities, highlighting areas requiring future investigation for responsible deployment of synthetic face recognition systems.

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

*Jooyeol Yun,Heng Wang,Yotaro Shimose,Jaegul Choo,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesignLab introduces a two-role iterative design system with a reviewer that identifies design issues and a contributor that fixes them, outperforming existing automated slide design tools by mimicking real-world iterative design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated slide design tools lack the ability to refine their own output, which is crucial in real-world design workflows. Non-experts struggle with the complexity of design choices, and current tools cannot iteratively improve their initial suggestions.

Method: The paper proposes DesignLab, which separates the design process into two roles: (1) a design reviewer that identifies design-related issues, and (2) a design contributor that corrects these issues. Large language models are fine-tuned for both roles, and intermediate drafts are simulated using controlled perturbations to train the models on design errors and corrections.

Result: DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including commercial tools, by enabling iterative refinement that produces polished, professional slides with qualities that were previously unattainable through single-pass generation.

Conclusion: The iterative two-role approach successfully mimics real-world design workflows, demonstrating that separating review and contribution functions enables continuous improvement of slide designs, leading to higher quality outputs than traditional automated design tools.

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Motivation: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is labor-intensive for dental technicians, creating a need for automated solutions to streamline the dental crown design process.

Method: The VBCD framework uses a two-stage approach: (1) generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral scans, (2) applies a fine-grained refiner with distance-aware supervision. Training incorporates Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) for better margin line alignment and positional prompts based on the FDI tooth numbering system.

Result: Evaluation on a large-scale dataset of intraoral scans showed that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior performance in automated dental crown design.

Conclusion: The VBCD framework provides a robust solution for personalized dental crown design, successfully automating the process while achieving better accuracy than existing methods, potentially reducing the workload for dental technicians.

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a cost-effective machine learning solution using YOLOv5 to automatically estimate timber log diameter from standard RGB images in real industrial environments, achieving 0.64 mAP@0.5 for practical wood processing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wood processing methods rely on expert human labor for species and thickness identification, which are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone when processing large volumes. There's a need for practical and cost-effective automation solutions that work in real-world conditions without expensive sensors or controlled environments.

Method: The researchers employed YOLOv5 object detection algorithm fine-tuned on the TimberSeg 1.0 public dataset to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness through bounding-box dimensions. The model was trained on RGB images captured under real-world working conditions in typical industrial sheds during timber delivery.

Result: The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating reliable log detection performance even with modest computing resources. The solution proved to be lightweight and scalable for practical implementation.

Conclusion: This lightweight, scalable solution shows promise for practical integration into existing workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting, particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized wood processing operations seeking cost-effective automation alternatives.

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIG-Nav introduces a pretrained vision-based robotic navigation model that achieves 22.6% improvement in zero-shot and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings by using early-fusion ViT architecture, auxiliary tasks, and novel game video data preprocessing pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretrained models for vision-based robotic navigation lack optimal design choices and sufficient diverse training data, limiting their generalization and zero-shot performance across different environments.

Method: The approach combines (1) early-fusion network architecture with pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to merge visual observations and goal images, (2) auxiliary tasks for enhanced global navigation representation learning, and (3) a novel data preprocessing pipeline to efficiently label large-scale game video datasets for training augmentation.

Result: PIG-Nav achieves 22.6% average improvement in zero-shot settings and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings compared to existing visual navigation foundation models, tested across two complex simulated environments and one real-world environment, while requiring significantly less fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The study advances state-of-the-art pretrained image-goal navigation models through strategic architectural design and data augmentation, demonstrating strong potential for real-world deployment with minimal labeled supervision requirements.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

*Lei Zhu,Jun Zhou,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MaskedCLIP, a framework that combines masked image modeling with contrastive language-image pre-training to leverage both paired and unpaired medical image data for learning more generalizable foundation models, demonstrated on retinal image analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in medical image analysis are limited by using either paired image-text data or unpaired image data exclusively, which restricts their ability to learn comprehensive image features. There's a need to fully harness both types of data simultaneously for better foundation model learning.

Method: MaskedCLIP framework combines masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training. A bridge transformer connects incompatible feature spaces from paired and unpaired data. The method includes masked knowledge distillation loss to transfer semantic knowledge from CLIP features back to masked features, creating mutually interactive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method, showing improved performance on downstream tasks compared to methods using only paired or unpaired data.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised vision-language pre-training approach successfully leverages both paired and unpaired medical image data to learn more generalizable image features, with the bridge transformer and knowledge distillation components effectively addressing the challenge of incompatible feature spaces.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

*Krishna Srikar Durbha,Asvin Kumar Venkataramanan,Rajesh Sureddi,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models as feature extractors to detect AI-generated images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a simple two-layer network while maintaining robustness against image degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of generative AI models creating massive amounts of "GenAI" content on the internet, there is a critical need for effective methods to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Existing detection methods need better generalization across unseen generative models and robustness against image degradations.

Method: The authors leverage existing IQA models that capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass statistical space as feature extractors. They train a simple two-layer neural network on the feature representations from these IQA models to classify real vs. AI-generated images, exploiting IQA models' sensitivity to diverse image distortions and their ability to predict human-perceived image quality.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in detecting fake images across different generative models. The approach shows significant robustness against various image degradations while maintaining high detection accuracy, indicating good generalization capabilities to unseen generative models.

Conclusion: IQA models can be effectively repurposed for GenAI image detection by serving as powerful feature extractors. The simple two-layer network architecture trained on IQA features achieves superior performance compared to existing methods while providing robust detection capabilities against image quality degradations, making it suitable for practical deployment in image processing pipelines.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates manual annotation requirements, improves generalizability, and enhances performance in low-level computer vision tasks using an emulated ISP pipeline and a large-scale radiometry correction dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current exposure correction methods face three key challenges: labor-intensive paired data annotation, limited generalizability across different scenarios, and performance degradation in low-level computer vision tasks. These limitations hinder practical deployment and effectiveness of existing approaches.

Method: The authors develop an unsupervised exposure correction approach that trains on freely available paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, eliminating manual annotation needs. They create a large-scale Radiometry Correction Dataset emphasizing exposure variations and develop a parameter-efficient transformation function that preserves image details.

Result: The proposed UEC method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods while using only 0.01% of their parameters. The approach demonstrates improved generalizability due to reduced annotation bias and shows effectiveness in mitigating adverse effects of poor exposure on downstream tasks like edge detection.

Conclusion: The unsupervised exposure correction method successfully addresses the three main challenges of existing approaches by eliminating annotation requirements, improving generalizability, and enhancing performance in low-level computer vision tasks, while being significantly more parameter-efficient than supervised alternatives.

Abstract: Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods

*Asir Saadat,Syem Aziz,Shahriar Mahmud,Abdullah Ibne Masud Mahi,Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VisionTrap, a dataset to evaluate how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) handle unanswerable questions on unrealistic images, testing whether models can recognize when they should abstain from answering rather than generating incorrect responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been extensively studied for answerable questions on real-world images, there has been limited exploration of how VLMs handle unanswerable questions. The authors aim to assess whether models can recognize the limitations of their knowledge and abstain from responding when appropriate.

Method: The researchers created VisionTrap, a dataset containing three categories of unanswerable questions: (1) hybrid entities fusing objects and animals, (2) objects in unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent figures. They posed logically structured but inherently unanswerable questions to test model behavior on these unrealistic images.

Result: The study reveals that VLMs often attempt to generate answers even when they should abstain from responding to unanswerable questions. The findings demonstrate the tendency of models to provide responses regardless of whether the questions are answerable based on the given images.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of incorporating unanswerable questions into VQA benchmarks to properly evaluate model behavior. It highlights that current VLMs may not adequately recognize when they should abstain from answering, suggesting a need for improved model training to handle such scenarios appropriately.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

*Kailong Zhang,Youwei Lyu,Heng Guo,Si Li,Zhanyu Ma,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarAnything is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes photorealistic polarization images from a single RGB input, eliminating the need for extensive 3D assets and enabling broader application of polarization imaging techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization images are valuable for image enhancement and 3D reconstruction, but limited accessibility of polarization cameras restricts their use. Existing simulators like Mitsuba require extensive 3D assets and cannot generate large-scale photorealistic images, creating a need for better polarization image synthesis methods.

Method: The authors propose PolarAnything, a diffusion-based generative framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models' zero-shot capabilities. They develop an effective representation strategy to preserve polarization property fidelity while generating images from single RGB inputs without requiring 3D asset collections.

Result: The model successfully generates high-quality polarization images with both photorealism and physical accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the synthesized images maintain polarization properties and can support downstream applications like shape from polarization tasks.

Conclusion: PolarAnything effectively addresses the limitations of existing polarization simulators by providing a practical solution for synthesizing polarization images from RGB inputs, potentially enabling broader adoption of polarization-based computer vision techniques without requiring specialized hardware or extensive 3D datasets.

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

### [41] [Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281)
*Huanli Zhuo,Leilei Ma,Haifeng Zhao,Shiwei Zhou,Dengdi Sun,Yanping Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FA-SAM is a fully automated medical image segmentation framework that extends SAM for single-source domain generalization by automatically generating prompts and reducing sensitivity to poor prompts through uncertainty modeling and multi-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM-based medical image segmentation models face two major challenges: (1) dependence on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts that prevent fully automated segmentation in clinical settings, and (2) vulnerability to poor prompts (like incorrectly sized bounding boxes) that can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results.

Method: The paper proposes FA-SAM with two key components: (1) Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) with Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module that models uncertainty distribution of shallow features to automatically generate bounding box prompts for target domains, and (2) Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into SAM mask decoder that combines multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local object details.

Result: Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FA-SAM in achieving fully automated medical image segmentation while maintaining robustness across different domains.

Conclusion: FA-SAM successfully addresses the key limitations of SAM-based medical image segmentation by enabling fully automated operation and reducing sensitivity to prompt quality, making it more suitable for clinical applications with validated effectiveness on medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

*Xuanyu Lin,Xiaona Zeng,Xianwei Zheng,Xutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointLAMA is a point cloud pretraining framework that combines Mamba architecture with local attention mechanisms and conditional diffusion to efficiently model 3D point clouds while capturing both global sequences and fine-grained geometric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba models excel at global sequence modeling with linear complexity for point clouds but lack local inductive bias needed to capture fine-grained geometric structures in 3D data, limiting their effectiveness for detailed point cloud understanding tasks.

Method: The framework integrates three key components: (1) task-aware point cloud serialization using Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert curves and axis-wise sorting for different tasks, (2) a hybrid encoder combining Latent Attention blocks with Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA) and Mamba blocks for local-global modeling, and (3) conditional diffusion mechanism for enhanced representation learning during pretraining.

Result: PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining minimal parameter count and FLOPs, demonstrating effective and efficient point cloud pretraining capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed PointLAMA successfully addresses Mamba's limitation in local geometric modeling by incorporating targeted attention mechanisms and conditional diffusion, resulting in an efficient point cloud pretraining framework that balances global sequence understanding with fine-grained structural capture.

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

TL;DR: A novel visual sensor-based monitoring system using multiple ML models achieves 92%+ accuracy in assembly process monitoring while reducing hardware costs and complexity in Industry 4.0 applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional assembly monitoring methods require multiple sensor types or complex hardware setups that are cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial environments, creating a need for a more practical solution using minimal visual sensors.

Method: Integration of multiple machine learning models that process state information from identical timestamps to detect and confirm assembly process stages using only minimal visual sensors.

Result: Achieved average accuracy exceeding 92% in assembly stage detection and confirmation, with enhanced error detection and visualization capabilities providing real-time actionable guidance to operators.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves assembly monitoring accuracy and efficiency while reducing dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications in Industry 4.0 contexts.

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasP introduces a cascaded correspondence pipeline for semi-dense feature matching that decomposes matching into two progressive phases with region-based selective cross-attention, achieving ~2.2× speedup while improving accuracy and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-dense feature matching methods rely on global search across entire feature maps for coarse matches, which limits both accuracy and efficiency improvements.

Method: A cascaded correspondence pipeline that: (1) decomposes matching into two progressive phases, (2) uses region-based selective cross-attention to enhance feature discriminability, (3) restricts search range in the second phase to one-to-many prior areas from the first phase, and (4) incorporates high-level features to reduce computational costs.

Result: Achieves ~2.2× speedup compared to ELoFTR at 1152 resolution, with acceleration gains increasing at higher resolutions. Demonstrates superior performance in geometric estimation and impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: CasP effectively addresses the limitations of global search in feature matching through cascaded correspondence priors, making it suitable for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications like SLAM and UAV systems.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified license plate recognition system that combines a lightweight visual encoder with a text decoder, achieving 99.34-99.58% accuracy on single-line and 98.70% on double-line Chinese license plates at 167 FPS processing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and CRNN-based approaches face limitations in license plate recognition due to the diversity of license plate types and imaging conditions in open environments, particularly with scarce double-line license plate datasets.

Method: The approach integrates a lightweight visual encoder with a text decoder in a pre-training framework for Chinese license plates.

Conclusion: The proposed unified solution effectively addresses the challenges of license plate recognition in diverse environments by combining lightweight architecture with perspective correction, achieving high accuracy and real-time processing capabilities for both single and double-line Chinese license plates.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167

*Chao He,Jianqiang Ren,Jianjing Xiang,Xiejie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CartoonAlive is a method that generates high-quality Live2D digital humans from a single portrait image in under 30 seconds by using 3D face modeling concepts to create facial blendshapes and inferring weights from detected facial keypoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital human approaches focus mainly on 3D models (complex and costly) or 2D video-based representations (inflexible), while interactive 2D cartoon-style Live2D models receive less attention despite being more efficient and expressive alternatives that enable dynamic real-time manipulation without traditional 3D modeling.

Method: The method leverages shape basis concepts from 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes suitable for Live2D, then infers corresponding blendshape weights based on facial keypoints detected from the input portrait image to generate the Live2D model.

Result: CartoonAlive can rapidly generate highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D models that closely resemble the input portrait within less than half a minute, providing a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon characters.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual character animation by providing an efficient alternative to complex 3D modeling and inflexible 2D video-based approaches for generating interactive cartoon-style digital humans.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work

### [47] [PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17332)
*Hyeongjin Nam,Donghwan Kim,Gyeongsik Moon,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARTE is a 3D human reconstruction method that uses human part segmentation to address texture misalignment issues, achieving state-of-the-art quality by combining a 3D part segmentation module with a part-guided texturing module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human reconstruction methods suffer from misaligned human textures across different body parts (e.g., jacket, pants), where textures blend incorrectly instead of maintaining distinct boundaries. Most methods don't exploit part segmentation priors, leading to poor texture quality in invisible regions when reconstructing from single images.

Method: The framework consists of two core components: (1) PartSegmenter - a 3D part segmentation module that reconstructs a textureless human surface from a single image and predicts human part labels, and (2) PartTexturer - a part-guided texturing module that incorporates part information into texture reconstruction using prior knowledge from pre-trained image generation networks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PARTE achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction, successfully addressing the texture misalignment problem by leveraging structural coherence of human parts.

Conclusion: The proposed PARTE framework effectively utilizes 3D human part information as guidance to reconstruct coherent 3D human textures, solving the critical limitation of texture misalignment in existing methods and achieving superior reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

Motivation: Traditional alignment pipelines require separate policy and reward models with frozen parameters during RL, creating resource-intensive workflows and performance limitations due to static reward signals. There's a need for a more efficient approach that can dynamically learn rewards while optimizing policy.

Method: URPO (Unified Reward & Policy Optimization) combines instruction-following and reward modeling in a single model using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The method converts all alignment data (preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, open-ended instructions) into a unified generative format, enabling the model to learn from ground-truth preferences while generating its own rewards.

Result: On Qwen2.5-7B, URPO outperformed baselines with separate reward models: AlpacaEval instruction-following score improved from 42.24 to 44.84, composite reasoning average increased from 32.66 to 35.66, and achieved a RewardBench score of 85.15 (vs. 83.55 for the dedicated reward model it replaced).

Conclusion: URPO provides a simpler, more efficient, and more effective approach to language model alignment by eliminating separate reward models and creating co-evolutionary dynamics between generation and evaluation, leading to better-aligned models with superior internal evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.

*Weihua Gao,Chunxu Ren,Wenlong Niu,Xiaodong Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework for detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems without manual annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance at over 1000 FPS through temporal signal modeling and a novel TSRNet architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems is challenging due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and lack reliable annotations for training.

Method: The paper proposes a Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that reformulates detection as pixel-wise temporal signal modeling. It develops a Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) with encoder-decoder architecture, integrates Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module for temporal pattern sensitivity, and employs graph-based trajectory mining to suppress false alarms and ensure temporal consistency.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, demonstrating real-time capability.

Conclusion: The TPS framework successfully addresses the challenge of weak target detection in surveillance systems by eliminating the need for manual annotations while maintaining high performance and real-time processing speed, making it suitable for practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

*Jie Wang,Zhendong Yang,Liansong Zong,Xiaobo Zhang,Dexian Wang,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2P-MMT is a diffusion-based dual-branch framework for multimodal machine translation that uses reconstructed images instead of original images to reduce visual noise sensitivity while maintaining translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMT approaches require paired image-text inputs and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, limiting their robustness and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: D2P-MMT uses a dual-branch prompting framework with pre-trained diffusion models to generate reconstructed images that filter out distracting details while preserving semantic information. The model trains on both authentic and reconstructed images with distributional alignment loss to ensure consistency between branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on Multi30K dataset show D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art MMT approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed D2P-MMT framework successfully addresses the robustness issues in multimodal translation by leveraging diffusion-generated images and dual-branch training, demonstrating improved performance over current methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMo++ is a framework that improves autonomous driving motion forecasting and planning by decoupling motion estimation into holistic intentions and fine spatiotemporal states, using a hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion forecasting methods use a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm that produces diverse motion intentions but fails to adequately model the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, leading to potential collisions or suboptimal outcomes in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes DeMo++, which decouples motion estimation into two components: (1) holistic motion intentions to capture diverse movement directions, and (2) fine spatiotemporal states to track dynamic progress and enable self-refinement. It introduces a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism and implements a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba architectures for efficient scene aggregation and trajectory modeling.

Result: DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM), demonstrating superior ability to model both motion diversity and spatiotemporal evolution.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach of separating motion intentions from spatiotemporal states, combined with cross-scene interaction mechanisms and hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture, effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and provides comprehensive modeling for safer and more efficient autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

*Xiaohao Liu,Xiaobo Xia,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMRL is a novel multimodal representation learning framework that aligns multiple modalities simultaneously without relying on anchor modalities by optimizing the dominant singular value of representation matrices, achieving better performance and stability than traditional pairwise contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal representation learning methods rely on pairwise contrastive learning with predefined anchor modalities, which restricts alignment across all modalities. Existing simultaneous alignment approaches face challenges including limitations from fixed anchor points and instability from optimizing products of singular values.

Method: PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction, based on the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix. It uses a softmax-based loss function treating singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value, and applies instance-wise contrastive regularization on leading eigenvectors to maintain inter-instance separability.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods, showing improved performance in multimodal representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: PMRL successfully addresses the limitations of traditional anchor-dependent methods by providing a principled approach to simultaneous multimodal alignment that is both more stable and effective, with theoretical grounding in singular value optimization for achieving full modality alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Swin-TUNA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that achieves high-performance food image segmentation by updating only 4% of parameters, outperforming existing large-scale models while reducing parameter count by 98.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large-scale Transformer-based models like FoodSAM have massive parameter counts and high computational demands that make them impractical for real-world deployment in food image processing applications, creating a need for more efficient segmentation techniques.

Method: The paper proposes Swin-TUNA (TUNable Adapter module), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that integrates multiscale trainable adapters into Swin Transformer architecture. It uses hierarchical feature adaptation with separable convolutions, dimensional mappings of varying scales, and a dynamic balancing strategy for task-agnostic and task-specific features.

It also demonstrates faster convergence and stronger generalization in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Swin-TUNA provides an efficient solution for lightweight food image segmentation by achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters, making it practical for industrial deployment while maintaining high accuracy and demonstrating better generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and

*Yuzhe Zhu,Lile Cai,Kangkang Lu,Fayao Liu,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning approach to reduce the expensive pixel-level annotation requirements for training semantically-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), achieving over 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training semantically-aware NeRFs requires pixel-level class labels which are prohibitively expensive to collect, creating a significant annotation burden that limits the practical application of these models.

Method: The authors investigate various active learning design choices including selection granularity and selection strategies, and propose a novel active learning strategy that incorporates 3D geometric constraints in the sample selection process for semantically-aware NeRF training.

Result: The proposed active learning approach effectively reduces annotation costs, achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random sampling while maintaining the quality of semantically-aware NeRF training.

Conclusion: Active learning is a viable solution for reducing the annotation burden in semantically-aware NeRF training, with the proposed 3D geometry-aware selection strategy significantly outperforming random sampling in terms of annotation efficiency.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random
sampling.

*Lile Cai,Ramanpreet Singh Pahwa,Xun Xu,Jie Wang,Richard Chang,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning approach for semiconductor X-Ray microscopy (XRM) defect detection that addresses domain shift and class imbalance through contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample selection to reduce annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for semiconductor XRM defect identification require large amounts of annotated data, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Active learning could potentially reduce this annotation burden, but faces unique challenges in semiconductor XRM including large domain shift and severe class imbalance.

Method: The authors propose a two-pronged approach: (1) contrastive pretraining on unlabelled data to obtain initialization weights for each active learning cycle, addressing domain shift issues, and (2) a rareness-aware acquisition function that prioritizes selection of samples containing rare classes to handle severe class imbalance problems.

Result: The method was evaluated on a semiconductor dataset compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory structures with logic and memory dies, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning framework successfully addresses the key challenges of domain shift and class imbalance in semiconductor XRM analysis, achieving superior performance while reducing annotation requirements through strategic sample selection and contrastive pretraining.

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Lile Cai,Xun Xu,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a region-based active learning framework for semantic segmentation that incorporates spatial diversity alongside traditional uncertainty criteria to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring large-scale labeled datasets for semantic segmentation incurs high annotation costs due to dense pixel-level labeling requirements. The authors aim to reduce these costs while maintaining performance through strategic region selection for labeling.

Method: The authors develop a unified optimization framework that combines spatial diversity with traditional active learning criteria (uncertainty, feature diversity) for region-based active learning. Instead of labeling entire images, they select informative image regions that maintain local spatial diversity.

Result: The framework achieves 95% performance of fully supervised methods using only 5-9% of labeled pixels on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets. It outperforms all state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Enforcing local spatial diversity in region-based active learning significantly improves performance compared to using uncertainty or feature diversity alone. The proposed unified framework effectively reduces annotation costs while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

*Keon-Hee Park,Seun-An Choe,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), which enables pre-trained object detectors to adapt to new domains without source data access while detecting both known and unknown objects, using a novel CollaPAUL framework that combines collaborative tuning and principal axis-based unknown labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional source-free object detection operates under the restrictive closed-set assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain, preventing detection of undefined objects. This limitation reduces practical applicability in real-world scenarios where new object types may appear.

Method: The paper proposes CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling) framework with two key components: (1) Collaborative tuning that integrates target-dependent knowledge from auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from pre-trained detector using cross-domain attention mechanism, and (2) Principal axes-based unknown labeling that assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness through principal axes projection and confidence scores.

Result: CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performance on SFUOD benchmarks, with extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for detecting both known and unknown objects in source-free domain adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed SFUOD scenario and CollaPAUL framework successfully address the limitations of closed-set assumptions in source-free object detection, enabling practical deployment where detectors can adapt to new domains while identifying both familiar and novel objects without requiring access to original training data.

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

*Peng Wu,Qiuxia Lai,Hao Fang,Guo-Sen Xie,Yilong Yin,Xiankai Lu,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that models attribute-object dependencies by decomposing composition probability into object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood, using textual descriptors and cross-attention to improve generalization to unseen attribute-object combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CZSL approaches treat attributes and objects as independent entities, overlooking semantic constraints and contextual dependencies within compositions. The same attribute can manifest differently depending on context (e.g., "young tree" vs "young dog"), and certain attributes naturally pair with specific objects, making attribute-object interdependence a fundamental challenge in CZSL.

Method: The authors adopt a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) that decomposes composition probability into two components: object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood. They incorporate textual descriptors to enhance object feature learning by highlighting semantically relevant image regions, then use these enhanced object features to guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism for better contextual alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods, showing improved generalization to unseen attribute-object compositions.

Conclusion: By jointly optimizing object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood, the method effectively captures compositional dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions, addressing the long-ignored challenge of attribute-object interdependence in CZSL.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoGen is the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that uses autoregressive modeling with Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) and Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) to generate high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic videos for medical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior endoscopic video generation efforts either focused on static images lacking dynamic context or relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful clinical references. There was a need for conditional endoscopic video generation that could provide dynamic, contextually relevant content for medical diagnostics.

Method: The authors propose EndoGen, which builds an autoregressive model with two key components: (1) Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy that reformulates multi-frame generation as grid-based image generation to leverage global dependency modeling, and (2) Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism that selectively focuses on semantically meaningful regions during generation to enhance content diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content. The generated videos also improve performance on the downstream task of polyp segmentation, indicating practical clinical utility.

Conclusion: EndoGen successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by providing the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that produces clinically relevant, high-quality dynamic content, with demonstrated benefits for downstream medical imaging tasks like polyp segmentation.

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

TL;DR: HiProbe-VAD proposes a training-free video anomaly detection framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by extracting informative hidden states from intermediate layers using Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing, achieving superior performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video anomaly detection methods face substantial computational demands and require extensive labeled datasets, limiting their practical applicability. The authors aim to develop a more efficient and scalable solution that can work without fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Method: The paper introduces HiProbe-VAD framework with Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from optimal intermediate layers of MLLMs during reasoning. It includes a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module to detect anomalies using extracted hidden states and generate explanations.

Result: HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The framework demonstrates remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities across different MLLMs without requiring any tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unlocks the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection by utilizing intermediate hidden states, providing a more practical and scalable solution that works without fine-tuning and generalizes across different models.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

*Li Jun,Wang Jinpeng,Tan Chaolei,Lian Niu,Chen Long,Zhang Min,Wang Yaowei,Xia Shu-Tao,Chen Bin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HLFormer introduces the first hyperbolic modeling framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), combining hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces to better capture hierarchical video semantics and improve text-video matching performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks hierarchical semantics, leading to suboptimal temporal modeling when matching untrimmed videos with partial text queries.

Method: HLFormer integrates Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, uses Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module for dynamic feature fusion, and introduces Partial Order Preservation Loss with Lorentzian cone constraints to enforce "text < video" hierarchy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in partially relevant video retrieval tasks, showing improved cross-modal matching capabilities.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic modeling framework successfully addresses the limitations of Euclidean space in capturing video hierarchical semantics, providing a novel and effective approach for partially relevant video retrieval through hybrid space learning and hierarchical constraint enforcement.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

### [62] [Physics-based Human Pose Estimation from a Single Moving RGB Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17406)
*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Chuqiao Li,Diogo Luvizon,Rishabh Dabral,Martin Oswald,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset with ground-truth camera trajectories and 3D human motion, and proposes PhysDynPose, a physics-based method for accurate human pose tracking with moving cameras in non-flat environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods suffer from artifacts when dealing with non-flat ground planes or moving cameras. Current evaluation methods rely on either in-the-wild videos without ground truth or synthetic datasets that fail to model real-world conditions like light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced changes.

Method: PhysDynPose combines a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator for human pose estimation with a robust SLAM method to capture dynamic camera trajectories, enabling human pose recovery in world frame coordinates. The method then refines the kinematic pose estimates using a scene-aware physics optimizer that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints.

Result: The new benchmark reveals that even state-of-the-art methods struggle with moving cameras and non-planar environments, while PhysDynPose robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates. The MoviCam dataset provides the first non-synthetic ground-truth data for this challenging scenario.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the limitations of existing human pose tracking methods in dynamic camera scenarios by providing both a comprehensive dataset (MoviCam) and an effective solution (PhysDynPose) that incorporates scene geometry and physics constraints for improved accuracy in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

*Farnaz Khun Jush,Steffen Vogler,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-MIR, a novel volumetric content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system for medical images that adapts ColBERT's late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging, eliminating the need for pre-segmented data while improving tumor detection and staging performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of medical images creates challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Existing CBIR systems lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies, and current approaches rely on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, which doesn't align with real-world clinical practice using large unstructured image archiving systems like PACS.

Method: The authors developed C-MIR, a volumetric re-ranking method that adapts ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging. They created a framework that eliminates reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, making it compatible with clinical PACS systems. The method was evaluated across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations.

Result: C-MIR demonstrated significant advantages in medical image retrieval. It successfully adapted the late interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective context-aware re-ranking. The method showed improved performance in tumor flagging, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05), and demonstrated potential for improving tumor staging. C-MIR effectively localized regions of interest without requiring pre-segmentation, offering a computationally efficient alternative.

Conclusion: C-MIR bridges the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and practical healthcare applications. The system eliminates the need for expensive data enrichment steps while maintaining effective performance in tumor detection and staging. This work paves the way for improved diagnostic processes by providing a practical CBIR solution that aligns with real-world clinical workflows and unstructured medical image archives.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

*Sneha George Gnanakalavathy,Hairil Abdul Razak,Robert Meertens,Jonathan E. Fieldsend,Xujiong Ye,Mohammed M. Abdelsamea*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPRI-CT is a causal-aware deep learning framework that integrates CT image data with acquisition metadata to optimize image quality while minimizing radiation exposure through predictive modeling and counterfactual inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT imaging faces the clinical challenge of achieving high image quality while minimizing radiation exposure to patients. Current approaches lack the ability to predict image quality outcomes and perform what-if simulations for different scanning parameters without repeated physical scans.

Method: The framework uses an ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to extract features from CT images and acquisition metadata (tube voltage, current, contrast agents). These features are fused to model causal relationships and predict Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The system supports counterfactual inference for simulating parameter changes and is trained using ensemble learning.

Result: CAPRI-CT achieved strong predictive performance in modeling image quality outcomes. The framework successfully enables what-if simulations for changes in contrast agents, concentrations, and scan parameters, providing actionable insights for CT protocol optimization.

Conclusion: CAPRI-CT provides a practical solution for radiologists and technicians to design more efficient CT protocols by combining prediction and interpretability. The framework offers the potential to optimize imaging workflows without requiring repeated physical scans, ultimately improving patient care while reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

### [65] [Dynamic-DINO: Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts Tuning for Real-time Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17436)
*Yehao Lu,Minghe Weng,Zekang Xiao,Rui Jiang,Wei Su,Guangcong Zheng,Ping Lu,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic-DINO, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to real-time open-vocabulary object detection by extending Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, achieving better performance with only 1.56M open-source data compared to models trained on private 20M datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MoE architecture has shown success in Large Vision-Language Models, its potential in real-time open-vocabulary object detectors using smaller models and large-scale vision-language datasets remains unexplored, presenting an opportunity to improve efficiency and performance in object detection tasks.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic-DINO using: (1) MoE-Tuning strategy to convert dense Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge to dynamic inference framework, (2) granularity decomposition mechanism to split Feed-Forward Networks into multiple smaller expert networks, (3) pre-trained weight allocation strategy for experts with specific router initialization, and (4) input-relevant expert activation during inference to form compact subnets.

Result: Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge despite being pretrained with only 1.56M open-source data compared to the baseline's private Grounding20M dataset. The research reveals that shallow layers show expert cooperation with diverse peers, while deeper layers develop fixed collaborative structures with 2-3 partners specialized for specific patterns.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that MoE architecture can be effectively applied to real-time open-vocabulary object detection, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data while revealing interesting collaboration patterns between experts across different network depths.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

### [66] [VLM-Guided Visual Place Recognition for Planet-Scale Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17455)
*Sania Waheed,Na Min An,Michael Milford,Sarvapali D. Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid geo-localization framework combining vision-language models (VLMs) with visual place recognition (VPR) methods to improve planet-scale image geo-localization by using VLM-generated geographic priors to guide retrieval and re-ranking processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geo-localization methods face scalability and perceptual aliasing issues (retrieval-based) or lack generalization and require extensive training data (classification-based). While VLMs show promise with contextual understanding, they suffer from hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone solutions for geo-localization tasks.

Method: A novel hybrid framework that: (1) uses a VLM to generate geographic priors that constrain the retrieval search space, (2) employs a retrieval step using visual place recognition methods, and (3) implements a re-ranking mechanism that selects geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity to initially estimated coordinates.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple geo-localization benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 4.51% at street level and up to 13.52% at city level. The combination demonstrates scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization performance.

Conclusion: VLM-generated geographic priors combined with VPR methods create an effective hybrid system that addresses the limitations of both traditional retrieval/classification approaches and standalone VLM solutions, resulting in improved scalable and robust geo-localization at planet scale.

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

*Francesco Tonini,Lorenzo Vaquero,Alessandro Conti,Cigdem Beyan,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DYSCO, a training-free HOI detection framework that leverages Vision-Language Models to detect human-object interactions without requiring manual annotations, using a multimodal registry and multi-head attention mechanism to achieve competitive performance especially on rare interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods rely heavily on large datasets with manual annotations that are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. The authors argue that Vision-Language Models offer untapped potential for enhancing interaction representation that hasn't been fully exploited by prior work.

Method: The paper introduces DYSCO (Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics), a training-free framework that uses a multimodal registry incorporating visual cues and interaction signatures to improve semantic alignment of verbs. It employs a multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights visual and textual feature contributions for robust interaction understanding.

Result: DYSCO surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and achieves competitive performance with training-based approaches. The method particularly excels in detecting rare interactions, demonstrating effective generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed DYSCO framework successfully addresses the limitations of annotation-dependent HOI detection by leveraging Vision-Language Models in a training-free manner, achieving strong performance while being particularly effective for rare interactions that are challenging for traditional approaches.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

### [68] [ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462)
*Chang Nie,Guangming Wang,Zhe Lie,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMV is a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits 4D multi-view sequential robotic data to address data scarcity in robot imitation learning, using innovative attention mechanisms and sparse sampling to maintain consistency while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot imitation learning using Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models faces severe constraints due to high data collection costs and scarcity of high-quality 4D multi-view sequential images, with current lack of methods for editing such complex multi-view manipulation data.

Method: ERMV framework introduces three key innovations: (1) Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism for spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, (2) Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module that decouples temporal and spatial views through sparse sampling to reduce computational demands, and (3) feedback intervention mechanism using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request expert guidance when needed.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ERMV-augmented data significantly improves the robustness and generalization performance of VLA models in both simulated and real-world robotic environments.

Conclusion: ERMV successfully addresses the core challenges of editing 4D multi-view sequential robotic data by maintaining geometric and appearance consistency, expanding working windows with low computational costs, and preserving semantic integrity of critical objects, thereby enabling effective data augmentation for robot imitation learning.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

*Elena Pitta,Tom Kouwenhoven,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Visual Entailment (VE) as a probe for vision-language understanding using LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision, finding that while fine-tuning achieves strong performance (83.3% accuracy), the task has limitations including over-reliance on linguistic priors and questionable visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Visual Entailment serves as a reliable probe for vision-language understanding in multimodal language models, and to interpret what performance results reveal about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task.

Method: Conducted experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model. Explored factors including prompt design, number and order of in-context examples, and access to visual information. Used explanation-based evaluations to probe reasoning processes and evaluated performance on e-SNLI-VE dataset.

Result: Three-shot inference outperformed zero-shot baselines, but additional examples introduced noise. Label order in prompts significantly influenced predictions. Without visual information, the model showed strong tendency to hallucinate. Fine-tuning achieved 83.3% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art OFA-X model. Explanation evaluation showed BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%, but comparable scores were found in limited vision experiments.

Conclusion: Visual Entailment has both utility and limitations as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding. The results highlight issues with over-reliance on linguistic priors and questionable visual grounding, pointing to the need for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRMambaV2 is a novel sparse point cloud upsampling method for autonomous driving that uses biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention and dual-branch architecture to improve reconstruction quality in long-range sparse regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving faces challenges due to inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures. Existing methods converting 3D scenes to 2D image super-resolution tasks struggle with sparse and blurry feature representation, making accurate reconstruction of detailed spatial topologies difficult.

Method: The paper proposes SRMambaV2 with three key components: (1) a biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism inspired by human driver visual perception to model feature distribution in distant sparse areas, (2) a dual-branch network architecture to enhance sparse feature representation, and (3) a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function to refine fine-grained detail reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that SRMambaV2 achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for automotive sparse point cloud upsampling tasks, demonstrating enhanced upsampling accuracy in long-range sparse regions while preserving overall geometric reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2 effectively addresses the challenges of LiDAR point cloud upsampling in autonomous driving scenarios by combining biomimetic attention mechanisms with dual-branch architecture and adaptive loss functions, proving its effectiveness and practical value for automotive applications.

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

*Hugues Roy,Reuben Dorent,Ninon Burgos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnoBFN, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method based on Bayesian Flow Networks for detecting Alzheimer's disease-related anomalies in FDG PET brain images, outperforming existing VAE, GAN, and diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection is crucial in neuroimaging for identifying deviations from healthy brain data to facilitate neurological disorder diagnosis. While Bayesian Flow Networks show promise as generative models, they haven't been applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection tasks yet.

Method: The authors developed AnoBFN, an extension of Bayesian Flow Networks that combines diffusion frameworks with Bayesian inference. The method performs conditional image generation under high spatially correlated noise and preserves subject specificity through recursive feedback from input images during the generative process.

Result: AnoBFN was evaluated on Alzheimer's disease anomaly detection in FDG PET images and demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods including beta-VAE, f-AnoGAN, and AnoDDPM, showing better anomaly detection capabilities with reduced false positive rates.

Conclusion: AnoBFN effectively leverages Bayesian Flow Networks for medical anomaly detection, successfully combining the strengths of diffusion models and Bayesian inference to achieve improved performance in detecting neurological abnormalities while maintaining low false positive rates in neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DFDNet, a novel frequency-domain approach for removing flare artifacts from nighttime photography by dynamically decoupling content from flare information in the frequency domain, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong light sources in nighttime photography create flare artifacts that degrade visual quality and impact downstream tasks. Existing methods struggle with large-scale flare removal and structural damage repair near light sources. The authors observed that flare artifacts show more significant discrepancies in the frequency domain than spatial domain compared to reference images.

Method: The paper proposes DFDNet with two main components: (1) Global Dynamic Frequency-domain Guidance (GDFG) module that dynamically optimizes global frequency features to separate flare from content information, and (2) Local Detail Guidance Module (LDGM) using contrastive learning to align local light source features with reference images for better fine-grained restoration.

Result: Experimental results show that DFDNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in flare removal performance, effectively handling large-scale flare artifacts while preserving structural details and reducing local damage from flare removal.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain approach proves effective for flare artifact removal, with DFDNet successfully decoupling content from flare information and achieving superior performance through dynamic frequency guidance and local detail preservation strategies.

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of deep learning methods for X-ray object detection in security screening, testing 10 state-of-the-art detection schemes across 6 large-scale datasets to provide systematic insights into their performance, computational efficiency, and practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security
screening in various public settings. However, challenges such as object
occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray
scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable
detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field,
reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently
conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate
further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation
of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is
conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed,
composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for
X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and
PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering
all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and
computational complexity analysis. To support reproducibility of the reported

### [74] [Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511)
*Jiajun Luo,Yicheng Xiao,Jianru Xu,Yangxiu You,Rongwei Lu,Chen Tang,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompactFusion is a compression framework that reduces communication overhead in parallel diffusion model inference by exploiting temporal redundancy in activations, achieving significant speedups while maintaining generation quality through residual compression and error feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require substantial computational resources and multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment, but parallel inference suffers from significant communication overhead due to exchanging large activations between devices. The authors observed that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy, with adjacent steps producing highly similar activations that saturate bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.

Method: CompactFusion uses Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences) instead of full activations. The framework integrates lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation over time. The method is designed to encode only essential information by removing redundant data from the communication stream.

Result: On 4xL20 hardware, CompactFusion achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity compared to prior methods. For communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, it delivers 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based methods. The framework maintains high generation quality while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference that delivers lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than existing methods. The framework applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework, and offers a portable implementation that is publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

*Tian Guo,Hui Yuan,Xiaolong Mao,Shiqi Jiang,Raouf Hamzaoui,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes STQE, a neural network that enhances the visual quality of compressed dynamic point clouds by exploiting spatial-temporal correlations, achieving significant improvements in PSNR and BD-rate reductions across color components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds, particularly the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored, creating a research gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: The paper proposes a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network with four key components: (1) recoloring-based motion compensation module for inter-frame geometric alignment, (2) channel-aware temporal attention module for highlighting relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, (3) Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module for capturing spatial dependencies, and (4) joint loss function based on Pearson correlation coefficient to reduce over-smoothing effects.

Result: When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with BD-rate reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed STQE network successfully exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to significantly improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds, demonstrating substantial performance gains across all color components through innovative modules and loss function design.

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%

### [76] [Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training for Improved Point Cloud Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17533)
*Liwen Liu,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPT is a multi-modal multi-task pre-training framework that enhances 3D point cloud understanding by combining three self-supervised tasks: token-level reconstruction, point-level reconstruction, and multi-modal contrastive learning between 3D and 2D data, without requiring 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal pre-training frameworks for 3D applications rely on single pre-training tasks, which limits their ability to gather abundant information from other relevant tasks. This limitation hinders performance in downstream tasks, especially in complex and diverse domains where richer multi-modal information could be beneficial.

Method: The paper proposes MMPT framework with three complementary pre-training tasks: (1) Token-level reconstruction (TLR) to recover masked point tokens for representative learning, (2) Point-level reconstruction (PLR) to predict masked point positions directly, and (3) Multi-modal contrastive learning (MCL) to combine feature correspondences within and across 3D point cloud and 2D image modalities in a self-supervised manner.

Result: The framework operates without requiring 3D annotations, making it scalable for large datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various downstream tasks. Evaluation shows improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various discriminant and generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMPT successfully addresses the limitations of single-task pre-training by integrating multiple complementary tasks that leverage both 3D and 2D modalities. The framework demonstrates superior performance on downstream tasks while maintaining scalability through its annotation-free approach, making it a promising solution for enhanced point cloud understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

### [77] [An h-space Based Adversarial Attack for Protection Against Few-shot Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17554)
*Xide Xu,Sandesh Kamath,Muhammad Atif Butt,Bogdan Raducanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes HAAD, a novel adversarial attack method that protects private content from unauthorized diffusion model customization by crafting perturbations in the semantic latent space (h-space), with an efficient variant HAAD-KV that uses only KV parameters for stronger and computationally cheaper protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few samples raises significant privacy concerns regarding unauthorized modifications of private content, necessitating the development of protection mechanisms based on adversarial attacks to poison diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), which leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the semantic latent space (h-space) that encodes critical high-level features. They also introduce HAAD-KV, an efficient variant that constructs perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space.

Result: The proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in protecting against unauthorized diffusion model customization. HAAD-KV offers stronger protection while being computationally less expensive than the base HAAD method.

Conclusion: Despite their simplicity, HAAD and HAAD-KV demonstrate superior effectiveness compared to existing adversarial attack methods, providing an efficient solution for protecting private content from unauthorized diffusion model customization.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

### [78] [Boosting Ray Search Procedure of Hard-label Attacks with Transfer-based Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17577)
*Chen Ma,Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Qi Xuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a prior-guided approach for hard-label black-box adversarial attacks that uses transfer-based priors from surrogate models to improve gradient estimation and significantly reduces query requirements compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-label black-box adversarial attacks are challenging because only the top-1 predicted label is available, making gradient estimation expensive in terms of queries. Existing "sign trick" methods for gradient estimation are inefficient, requiring many queries to find adversarial examples.

Method: The authors develop a prior-guided gradient estimation approach that integrates transfer-based priors from surrogate models with random directions. They approximate the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and random directions in a query-efficient manner, transforming the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem with improved ray search efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of query efficiency. The authors also provide theoretical analysis showing improved expected cosine similarities between their gradient estimators and the true gradient.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that incorporating transfer-based priors from surrogate models can substantially improve the efficiency of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, both theoretically and empirically, making such attacks more practical while requiring fewer queries.

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: Real-world 3D scene-level scans provide realism and better generalizability for downstream applications, but their usage is limited by challenges including large data volumes, diverse annotation formats, and tool compatibility issues that need to be addressed for effective utilization.

Method: The authors propose a unified annotation integration methodology using USD (Universal Scene Description) with application-specific USD flavors to standardize and integrate diverse annotation formats from real-world 3D scans, along with mitigation strategies for identified challenges in utilizing holistic real-world scan datasets.

Result: The approach achieved an 80% success rate in LLM-based scene editing applications, enabling effective LLM understanding and adaptation of the 3D scan data, and an 87% success rate in robotic simulation for policy learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed USD-based unified annotation integration methodology successfully addresses the challenges of utilizing real-world 3D scene scans, as demonstrated by high success rates in both LLM-based scene editing and robotic simulation applications, making real-world scan datasets more accessible and effective for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Real-world 3D scene-level scans offer realism and can enable better
real-world generalizability for downstream applications. However, challenges
such as data volume, diverse annotation formats, and tool compatibility limit
their use. This paper demonstrates a methodology to effectively leverage these
scans and their annotations. We propose a unified annotation integration using
USD, with application-specific USD flavors. We identify challenges in utilizing
holistic real-world scan datasets and present mitigation strategies. The
efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through two downstream applications:
LLM-based scene editing, enabling effective LLM understanding and adaptation of
the data (80% success), and robotic simulation, achieving an 87% success rate
in policy learning.

### [80] [RemixFusion: Residual-based Mixed Representation for Large-scale Online RGB-D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17594)
*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Shuaifeng Zhi,Jiazhao Zhang,Zhoufeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RemixFusion introduces a novel residual-based mixed representation combining explicit TSDF grids with implicit neural modules for high-quality, large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction, achieving superior mapping and tracking accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit representations improve mapping completeness and memory efficiency over traditional explicit methods like TSDF, but suffer from lack of reconstruction details and time-consuming learning, limiting their application to large-scale online reconstruction scenarios.

Method: A residual-based mixed representation combining an explicit coarse TSDF grid with an implicit neural module that generates fine-grained residuals. The method includes pose change optimization instead of direct pose optimization, adaptive gradient amplification for better convergence, and a local moving volume approach for efficient online learning.

Result: The method surpasses all state-of-the-art approaches (both explicit and implicit representations) in terms of accuracy for both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes, achieving detail-rich reconstruction within bounded time and memory constraints.

Conclusion: RemixFusion successfully addresses the limitations of purely implicit neural representations by combining them with explicit representations, enabling high-quality camera tracking and detailed reconstruction for large-scale online RGB-D scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving models face deployment challenges due to large model sizes, expensive LiDAR sensor requirements, and computationally intensive BEV feature representations, limiting their scalability for mass-market camera-only vehicles.

Method: The paper proposes PRIX, featuring a visual feature extractor with a generative planning head that predicts trajectories directly from raw camera pixels. The key innovation is the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT) module that enhances multi-level visual features for robust planning without explicit BEV representation or LiDAR data.

Result: PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching the capabilities of larger multimodal diffusion planners while demonstrating significantly improved inference speed and reduced model size compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: PRIX provides a practical solution for real-world autonomous driving deployment by eliminating LiDAR dependency and BEV computation while maintaining competitive performance, making it suitable for mass-market vehicles with camera-only setups.

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvRGB+L is a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large, relightable, and dynamic scenes from RGB+LiDAR sequences by leveraging LiDAR intensity values for improved material estimation, enabling applications like relighting and night simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material estimates due to visible light interference. LiDAR's intensity values captured with active illumination in a different spectral range offer complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting conditions.

Method: The method introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model that incorporates LiDAR intensity information, and (2) RGB-LiDAR material consistency losses that ensure coherent material properties across both modalities. This approach leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome challenges in RGB-centric inverse graphics.

Result: The model successfully produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR renderings of urban and indoor scenes, supporting relighting, night simulations, and dynamic object insertions. Results surpass current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering and LiDAR simulation tasks.

Conclusion: InvRGB+L demonstrates that incorporating LiDAR intensity information significantly improves inverse rendering performance, particularly for material estimation in challenging lighting conditions. The method achieves superior results compared to existing approaches and enables practical applications like scene relighting and simulation.

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR

### [83] [Vision Transformer attention alignment with human visual perception in aesthetic object evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17616)
*Miguel Carrasco,César González-Martín,José Aranda,Luis Oliveros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares human visual attention patterns with Vision Transformer (ViT) attention mechanisms when evaluating handcrafted objects, finding that certain ViT attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly at optimal parameters (sigma=2.4), though fundamental differences exist between human focal attention and AI global attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Vision Transformers have shown remarkable capabilities in computer vision, but their alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored, especially in aesthetic contexts. Understanding this relationship could improve AI models for aesthetic evaluation and product design applications.

Method: Conducted eye-tracking experiments with 30 participants viewing 20 artisanal objects (basketry bags and ginger jars). Generated human attention heat maps using Pupil Labs eye-tracker and extracted attention maps from a pre-trained ViT model with DINO across 12 attention heads. Compared attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence with varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0) and performed statistical analysis including Tukey HSD tests.

Result: Optimal correlation found at sigma=2.4 ±0.03, with attention head #12 showing strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences between attention heads were identified, with heads #7 and #9 showing greatest divergence from human attention (p<0.05). ViTs exhibited more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, but certain heads could approximate human behavior for specific object features like buckles.

Conclusion: While ViTs show more global attention compared to human focal attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior under optimal conditions. This suggests potential applications in product design and aesthetic evaluation, but highlights fundamental differences between human perception and current AI attention strategies that need to be considered in future developments.

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a one-stage architecture for lane topology understanding in autonomous driving that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines, and topology relationships, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods for lane topology understanding suffer from error propagations and increased computational overheads, making them inefficient for autonomous driving applications that require accurate lane topology relationships for safety.

Method: The authors propose a one-stage architecture that reuses intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders to leverage relational knowledge from element detection for topology modeling without requiring additional graph networks. They also introduce knowledge distillation from standard definition (SD) map models to non-SD map models.

Result: Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning.

Conclusion: The one-stage architecture successfully addresses the limitations of two-stage methods by improving both accuracy and inference speed for lane topology understanding, and demonstrates that knowledge distillation enables superior performance even without SD maps.

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

*Thomas M. Metz,Matthew Q. Hill,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECHO-BID, a person re-identification model based on EVA-02 Large backbones that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term re-identification tasks, especially in challenging scenarios with clothing changes and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person identification in unconstrained environments faces significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging conditions, and clothing changes. Existing methods struggle with long-term re-identification scenarios where people change clothes or appear in occluded settings.

Method: The authors developed ECHO-BID using object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones and systematically compared it with 9 other models varying in backbone architecture, model size, object classification pretraining scale, and transfer learning protocols. They employed Masked Image Modeling during pretraining and tested different transfer learning datasets of varying difficulty levels.

Result: ECHO-BID achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-identification benchmarks, substantially outperforming other methods. It also showed superior performance in occluded viewing scenarios by a wide margin. The study found that smaller but more challenging transfer learning datasets generalized better across datasets, while larger datasets with additional fine-tuning worked best on the most difficult data.

Conclusion: The combination of increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining drives ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-identification. Proper selection of pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can lead to substantial gains in long-term re-identification performance, particularly for challenging scenarios involving clothing changes and occlusions.

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

*Olaf Dünkel,Artur Jesslen,Jiahao Xie,Christian Theobalt,Christian Rupprecht,Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CNS-Bench, a continuous nuisance shift benchmark that uses diffusion models with LoRA adapters to generate realistic image corruptions at varying severities for evaluating out-of-distribution robustness of image classifiers, revealing that model rankings change across different shift types and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD robustness evaluation methods use simple synthetic corruptions or binary shifts that fail to capture realistic nuisance variations occurring in real-world scenarios. There's a need for continuous, realistic benchmarks that can provide more nuanced understanding of model robustness across varying severity levels.

Method: The authors develop CNS-Bench using diffusion models with LoRA adapters to generate continuous nuisance shifts at various severities. They propose a filtering mechanism to address failure cases in generative models, enabling reliable benchmarking. The benchmark allows evaluation across a wide range of individual nuisance shifts with continuous severity levels.

Result: Large-scale evaluation of over 40 image classifiers revealed that model rankings change depending on shift types and severity scales, which cannot be detected with binary shifts. The continuous evaluation approach successfully identifies model failure points and provides more detailed robustness characterization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CNS-Bench provides a more comprehensive and realistic approach to evaluating OOD robustness by enabling continuous severity assessment of nuisance shifts. The benchmark demonstrates that model robustness varies significantly across different shift types and scales, highlighting the limitations of current binary evaluation approaches and the importance of continuous benchmarking for understanding model behavior.

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

### [87] [Attention (as Discrete-Time Markov) Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17657)
*Yotam Erel,Olaf Dünkel,Rishabh Dabral,Vladislav Golyanik,Christian Theobalt,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel interpretation of attention matrices in vision transformers as discrete-time Markov chains, enabling analysis of both direct and indirect attention patterns to improve zero-shot segmentation and image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous attention studies only model immediate effects and lack a unified framework for understanding attention operations like selection, summation, and averaging. There's a need for better understanding of how tokens are attended in modern visual transformers and how to leverage indirect attention propagation.

Method: The authors model attention matrices as discrete-time Markov chains and analyze metastable states where semantically similar tokens cluster attention. They use matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis to compute metastable states and define TokenRank as the steady state vector measuring global token importance.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance using lightweight computational tools. TokenRank application shows improvements in unconditional image generation tasks. The framework successfully identifies semantically coherent regions through attention clustering.

Conclusion: The Markov chain interpretation provides a fresh and unified view of attention mechanisms in visual transformers, enabling analysis of indirect attention effects and offering practical improvements in segmentation and generation tasks through simple mathematical tools.

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synergos-VQA introduces a novel framework that improves Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering by concurrently generating and fusing three complementary evidence streams (holistic, structural, and causal) to achieve more comprehensive reasoning, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models suffer from a fundamental bottleneck in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering due to their reliance on uni-dimensional evidence, leading to a "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" problem that prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding.

Method: Synergos-VQA framework concurrently generates and synergistically fuses three complementary evidence streams: (1) Holistic Evidence for perceiving the entire scene, (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects, and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure robust grounding.

Result: Synergos-VQA establishes new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. The framework demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities and significantly boosts various open-source MLLMs, proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

Conclusion: The synergistic fusion of multi-faceted evidence enables more comprehensive and reliable reasoning in visual question answering, and superior methodological design can achieve better performance than simply scaling model size.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MonoMRN, a two-stage framework for Monocular Semantic Scene Completion that decomposes the task into coarse completion followed by refinement using a Masked Recurrent Network with novel MS-GRU and distance attention projection components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage MSSC methods struggle with simultaneously achieving visible region segmentation and occluded region hallucination while being affected by inaccurate depth estimation, leading to suboptimal performance especially in complex scenes.

Method: A two-stage framework decomposing MSSC into coarse completion followed by Masked Recurrent Network refinement. Key components include: (1) Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU) that focuses on occupied regions through mask updating mechanism and sparse design for computational efficiency, and (2) distance attention projection that reduces projection errors by assigning attention scores based on distance to observed surfaces.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and SemanticKITTI datasets for both indoor and outdoor scenes. Robustness analysis shows the Masked Recurrent Network enhances model resilience to various disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed MonoMRN framework effectively addresses limitations of single-stage methods by decomposing the task and using specialized components, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across different scene types and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding in event cameras, along with EventRefer framework that uses attribute-aware grounding to connect asynchronous event streams with human language for dynamic environment understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide microsecond-level latency and motion blur robustness ideal for dynamic environments, but connecting these asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. Current methods lack proper benchmarks and frameworks for language-driven object grounding in event-based perception.

Method: The authors propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). The method incorporates four grounding attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to other objects, enabling spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning across different modalities.

Result: EventRefer achieves consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines across event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. The Talk2Event benchmark provides over 30,000 validated referring expressions built from real-world driving data, establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for the task.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and autonomy applications. The combination of the Talk2Event benchmark and EventRefer framework addresses the gap between event-based vision and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,

provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four

### [92] [BetterCheck: Towards Safeguarding VLMs for Automotive Perception Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17722)
*Malsha Ashani Mahawatta Dona,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Yinan Yu,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) on traffic scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset to assess their hallucination tendencies in automotive perception systems, proposing BetterCheck as a hallucination detection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs show impressive performance in understanding complex traffic situations and could potentially enhance automotive perception systems, they are prone to hallucination - either missing critical traffic agents like vulnerable road users or detecting non-existent ones. This poses safety risks for ADAS and autonomous driving systems, necessitating systematic evaluation and detection strategies.

Method: The authors systematically assess 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to evaluate their performance and hallucination patterns in automotive contexts. They propose BetterCheck as a hallucination detection strategy for VLM-supported perception systems.

Result: The evaluation reveals that both proprietary and open VLMs demonstrate remarkable image understanding capabilities, often detecting fine details that are difficult for humans to spot. However, these models are still prone to generating hallucinated elements in their descriptions of traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: VLMs show great potential for automotive perception systems due to their superior understanding of complex traffic situations compared to specialized neural networks. However, their tendency to hallucinate requires the implementation of detection strategies like BetterCheck to ensure safety guardrails in VLM-supported automotive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

*Kagan Ozturk,Louisa Conwill,Jacob Gutierrez,Kevin Bowyer,Walter J. Scheirer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for large-scale evaluation of how facial filters from social media apps affect automated face recognition systems, demonstrating cross-cultural differences and proposing methods to detect and mitigate filtering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on facial filters' impact on face recognition were limited to small numbers of hand-picked filters. There was a need for a comprehensive framework to study the wide range of filters across different social media platforms and understand their effects on automated recognition systems at scale.

Method: The authors developed a framework consisting of: (1) a controlled dataset of face images, (2) a principled filter selection process to choose representative filters for experimentation, and (3) systematic experiments to evaluate filters' impact on recognition. They conducted a case study comparing filters from American apps (Instagram, Snapchat) and Chinese apps (Meitu, Pitu).

Result: The framework successfully revealed cross-cultural differences in how filters from different applications affect face recognition. The study demonstrated that filtering effects can be detected in face embedding space and that recognition performance varies significantly across different types of filters and cultural contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables large-scale analysis of facial filters' impact on automated face recognition. The filtering effects can be detected and restored in face embedding space to improve recognition performance, providing a practical solution for mitigating filter-induced recognition degradation.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

Conclusion: Yume successfully demonstrates the ability to create interactive, dynamic virtual worlds from input images with high fidelity and user control, with all components (data, code, model weights) made publicly available and planned monthly updates to achieve the original comprehensive goal.

Abstract: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic,

we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion

*Yiwen Chen,Zhihao Li,Yikai Wang,Hu Zhang,Qin Li,Chi Zhang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra3D is an efficient 3D generation framework that accelerates sparse voxel modeling by using VecSet representation for coarse layout generation and Part Attention mechanism for localized refinement, achieving 6.7x speedup while maintaining high-resolution quality at 1024³ resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse voxel 3D generation frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in two-stage diffusion pipelines, limiting their practical application despite enabling high-quality fine-grained geometry modeling.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage approach: (1) VecSet representation to efficiently generate coarse object layout with reduced token count for faster voxel coordinate prediction, and (2) Part Attention - a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts computation within semantically consistent part regions, supported by a scalable part annotation pipeline converting raw meshes to part-labeled sparse voxels.

Result: Ultra3D achieves up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation while supporting high-resolution 3D generation at 1024³ resolution and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Ultra3D successfully addresses computational efficiency bottlenecks in sparse voxel 3D generation by introducing VecSet representation and Part Attention mechanism, enabling practical high-resolution 3D content generation with significant acceleration without quality compromise.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

### [96] [Towards Autonomous Sustainability Assessment via Multimodal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17012)
*Zhihan Zhang,Alexander Metzger,Yuxuan Mei,Felix Hähnlein,Zachary Englhardt,Tingyu Cheng,Gregory D. Abowd,Shwetak Patel,Adriana Schulz,Vikram Iyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces multimodal AI agents that can perform life cycle assessments (LCA) for electronic devices in under one minute, achieving carbon footprint estimates within 19% accuracy of expert LCAs without requiring proprietary data, while also developing fast methods for direct environmental impact estimation and emission factor generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LCA requires extensive data that is often unavailable and takes weeks or months of expert time to complete. There's a growing need for sustainability information, but current LCA processes are too slow and data-intensive to meet this demand efficiently.

Method: The authors developed multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and stakeholders, using custom data abstraction and software tools to extract information from online text and images from repair communities and government certifications. They also created a clustering method for direct environmental impact estimation and a data-driven approach for generating emission factors using weighted sums of similar materials.

Result: The AI agent approach reduces LCA time from weeks/months to under one minute while achieving carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs. The direct estimation method runs in 3ms with 12.28% MAPE on electronic products. The emission factor generation method improves MAPE by 120.26% compared to human experts selecting the closest database entry.

Conclusion: The multimodal AI approach successfully democratizes LCA by dramatically reducing time and data requirements while maintaining reasonable accuracy. This breakthrough could transform sustainability assessment workflows by making environmental impact calculations accessible and fast enough for widespread adoption in product development processes.

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However,
the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and
processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts
(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing
multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and
stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the
cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI
agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom
data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text
and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach
reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data
availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of
expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to
directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with
similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop
with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven
method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown
material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar
materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,
this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this
approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

### [97] [New Mechanisms in Flex Distribution for Bounded Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17054)
*Shao-Hung Chan,Thomy Phan,Jiaoyang Li,Sven Koenig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper improves the EECBS algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding by proposing new flex distribution mechanisms (Conflict-Based, Delay-Based, and Mixed-Strategy) that distribute computational flexibility more intelligently based on collision counts and delay estimates, resulting in better performance than the original greedy approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original EECBS algorithm with flex distribution can become inefficient when increased thresholds push the sum of costs beyond bounds, causing the algorithm to switch between different path sets instead of resolving collisions on a particular set, thus reducing efficiency in finding bounded-suboptimal solutions for multi-agent path finding.

Method: The paper proposes three new flex distribution mechanisms: (1) Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex proportional to collision numbers, (2) Delay-Based Flex Distribution that estimates delays needed to satisfy constraints, and (3) Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution that combines both approaches in a hierarchical framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that all proposed flex distribution mechanisms outperform the original greedy flex distribution approach in EECBS, while maintaining completeness and bounded-suboptimality guarantees.

Conclusion: The new flex distribution mechanisms successfully address the efficiency issues in EECBS by more intelligently allocating computational flexibility based on problem structure (conflicts and delays), leading to improved performance while preserving theoretical guarantees of completeness and bounded-suboptimality.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of
collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective
is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent
is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.
Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for
bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a
user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and
a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of
paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve
collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its
optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually
bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower
bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up
EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though
EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,
increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS
to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a
particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,
we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion
to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy
constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we
propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical
framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is
complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches
outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

### [98] [LoRA is All You Need for Safety Alignment of Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075)
*Yihao Xue,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for safety alignment fine-tuning can maintain LLM reasoning capabilities while achieving effective safety alignment, avoiding the "Safety Tax" problem where traditional safety fine-tuning degrades reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models require safety alignment to prevent harmful outputs, but traditional safety fine-tuning significantly degrades reasoning abilities (known as "Safety Tax"). The authors aim to find a method that can achieve safety alignment without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on refusal datasets instead of full-model fine-tuning. LoRA restricts safety weight updates to a low-rank space, minimizing interference with reasoning weights. They also explore regularization and weight merging methods to further reduce weight overlap.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmarks (math, science, and coding) show that LoRA-based safety alignment achieves safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning while preserving reasoning abilities. LoRA produces smaller weight overlap with initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning, and additional regularization/weight merging methods show some improvement on certain tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA effectively solves the reasoning-safety trade-off by enabling safety alignment without degrading reasoning capabilities. The approach maintains high safety levels while preserving model performance on complex reasoning tasks, suggesting that parameter-efficient methods can be superior to full fine-tuning for safety alignment.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex
problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with
harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the
post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been
shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the
"Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets
effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning
capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a
low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our
extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding
show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels
comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with
smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We
also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or
during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope
this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent
improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HySAFE-AI, a hybrid framework that adapts traditional safety analysis methods (FMEA and FTA) to evaluate the safety of modern end-to-end AI systems like LLMs and VLMs in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing integration of AI in safety-critical areas like autonomous driving and robotics, combined with the trend toward end-to-end monolithic architectures (LLMs, VLMs), necessitates improved safety analysis methods that can handle the intricate nature of foundational models and their latent representations.

Conclusion: The study presents HySAFE-AI as a solution for safety analysis of modern AI systems and provides guidance for future AI safety standards development, addressing the gap between traditional safety analysis methods and the complex nature of contemporary AI architectures.

Abstract: AI has become integral to safety-critical areas like autonomous driving
systems (ADS) and robotics. The architecture of recent autonomous systems are
trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large
language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we
review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of
common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and
fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the
intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and
utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety
Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts
traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer
hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety
standards.

*Qifan Zhang,Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Miao Peng,Jing Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphPile, a large-scale corpus for continued pretraining using Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) data, and trains GraphMind models that achieve significant improvements in both mathematical and non-mathematical reasoning tasks across multiple base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with novel and complex reasoning problems, and existing domain-specific continued pretraining methods lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. The authors aim to enhance general reasoning capabilities by leveraging Graph Problem Reasoning tasks that require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning.

Method: The researchers create GraphPile, a 10.9 billion token corpus spanning 23 graph tasks including pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning. The dataset incorporates chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph data. They then perform continued pretraining on popular base models (Llama 3, 3.1, and Gemma 2) to create GraphMind models.

Result: GraphMind achieves up to 4.9% higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2% improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks including logical and commonsense reasoning compared to base models. The improvements are demonstrated across multiple model architectures.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities by being the first to harness Graph Problem Reasoning for enhancing reasoning patterns. The introduction of GraphPile and GraphMind advances the adaptability and robustness of LLMs for general reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks,
yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems.
Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for
mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader
reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning
(GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks,
spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological
reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them
ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce
GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR
data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes
chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph
data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and
3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in
mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical
reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first
to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first
dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific
pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability
and robustness of LLMs.

### [102] [Agent Identity Evals: Measuring Agentic Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17257)
*Elija Perrier,Michael Timothy Bennett*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent Identity Evals (AIE), a framework for measuring how well language model agents maintain stable, reliable identity over time, addressing issues like stochasticity and sensitivity that can undermine their trustworthiness and agentic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model agents (LMAs) inherit pathologies from LLMs including statelessness, stochasticity, and prompt sensitivity, which can undermine their identifiability, continuity, persistence and consistency. This identity attrition erodes their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with core agentic capabilities like reasoning, planning and action.

Method: The authors develop Agent Identity Evals (AIE), a rigorous, statistically-driven empirical framework with novel metrics that can measure the degree to which LMA systems exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time. The framework includes formal definitions and methods applicable at each stage of the LMA life-cycle, with worked examples for practical application.

Result: AIE provides a comprehensive measurement framework that can integrate with other performance, capability and agentic robustness measures. The framework enables assessment of LMA capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations, offering practical guidance for optimal LMA infrastructure design.

Conclusion: The AIE framework offers a systematic approach to evaluate and ensure identity stability in language model agents, which is crucial for their trustworthiness and agentic capability. This can assist in designing better LMA infrastructure and scaffolding including memory systems and tools.

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents
(LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time.
However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs)
(statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and
linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability,
continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode
their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their
agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these
challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous,
statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an
LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including
their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations.
AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of
performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of
optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out
formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA
life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

*Shitong Zhu,Chenhao Fang,Derek Larson,Neel Reddy Pochareddy,Rajeev Rao,Sophie Zeng,Yanqing Peng,Wendy Summer,Alex Goncalves,Arya Pudota,Herve Robert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), an AI assistant for enterprise compliance tasks that uses a smart routing system to balance response quality and speed by choosing between FastTrack mode for simple queries and FullAgentic mode for complex requests requiring multiple tool invocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise compliance personnel need efficient AI assistance for daily tasks, but there's a challenge in balancing response quality with latency. Simple queries don't need complex processing, while complicated requests require sophisticated multi-step actions and tool usage.

Method: The system employs a user query router that intelligently selects between two modes: (1) FastTrack mode for simple requests requiring only context retrieval from knowledge corpora, and (2) FullAgentic mode for complex requests needing composite actions, tool invocations, and multi-step processing across various compliance artifacts and APIs.

Result: CBA significantly outperformed vanilla LLM on real-world privacy/compliance queries, achieving 83.7% vs 41.7% average keyword match rate and 82.0% vs 20.0% LLM-judge pass rate. The routing-based design showed better performance than individual modes while maintaining similar runtime.

Conclusion: The routing mechanism successfully validates the hypothesis that intelligent mode selection provides an optimal trade-off between response quality and latency, making CBA an effective solution for enterprise compliance assistance.

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational,
agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks
for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between
response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can
intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that
only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and
(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite
actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various
compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating
requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its
description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to
query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on
various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various
personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's
performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and
LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full
routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and
found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the
run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the
routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

Result: Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset show that Ctx2TrajGen achieves superior performance compared to existing methods across three key metrics: realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual fidelity. The framework provides a robust solution to data scarcity and domain shift issues without requiring simulation.

Conclusion: Ctx2TrajGen successfully generates realistic urban driving behaviors that are aligned with real-world context by leveraging context-aware conditioning and advanced generative techniques, offering significant improvements over existing trajectory generation methods for traffic analysis and autonomous driving applications.

TL;DR: UDASA is a framework that automatically aligns large language models with human intent by using uncertainty quantification across semantics, factuality, and value alignment to create preference pairs and progressive training stages without requiring human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high-quality alignment of LLMs with human intent and safety norms without human annotations remains a fundamental challenge, as current methods rely heavily on manual labeling which is expensive and may not scale effectively.

Method: UDASA generates multiple responses for each input, quantifies output uncertainty across three dimensions (semantics, factuality, value alignment), constructs preference pairs based on uncertainty scores, categorizes training samples into conservative/moderate/exploratory stages, and progressively optimizes the model across these stages.

Result: UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple evaluation tasks including harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation, showing significant improvements in model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-driven framework successfully enables automated LLM alignment without human annotations, demonstrating superior performance across various alignment tasks and providing a scalable solution for improving model safety and alignment with human values.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving
high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human
annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an
Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to
improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates
multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across
three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these
uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes
training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory,
according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized
progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of
preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong
empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that
UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including
harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation,
significantly improving model performance.

*Luca Salvatore Lorello,Nikolaos Manginas,Marco Lippi,Stefano Melacci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LTLZinc is a benchmarking framework that generates datasets for evaluating neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods on temporal reasoning tasks, combining linear temporal logic with MiniZinc constraints and image classification to create challenging temporal learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neuro-symbolic AI approaches focus on static scenarios, while the challenging setting of temporal reasoning where agents must expand knowledge over time while avoiding forgetting has been rarely explored. There's a need for benchmarking frameworks that can evaluate methods along both temporal and constraint-driven dimensions.

Method: The authors develop LTLZinc, a framework that generates datasets by combining linear temporal logic specifications with MiniZinc constraints and arbitrary image classification datasets. The framework provides fine-grained annotations enabling multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets.

Result: Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification tasks and four class-continual learning tasks demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning. The results highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art methods when applied to these temporal scenarios.

Conclusion: The LTLZinc framework successfully creates challenging temporal reasoning benchmarks that expose limitations in current neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods. The authors release the generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to foster research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks in the community.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures
with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable
formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge
over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned
concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting
where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom
explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can
be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against
which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the
temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive
temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic
specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification
datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic
training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six
neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks
generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning

### [108] [CQE under Epistemic Dependencies: Algorithms and Experiments (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17487)
*Lorenzo Marconi,Flavia Ricci,Riccardo Rosati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies using epistemic dependencies (EDs) to regulate information disclosure, focusing on answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries with optimal GA censors while maintaining security guarantees and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to control information disclosure in ontology-based systems while maintaining query answering capabilities, particularly when dealing with sensitive data that requires regulatory compliance and security guarantees in knowledge base systems.

Method: Combines epistemic dependencies (EDs) with optimal GA censors (maximal sets of safely revealable ground atoms) and develops an intersection-based approach for answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs). The method includes characterizing security properties, identifying safe ED classes (full EDs), and presenting a first-order rewriting algorithm for DL-Lite_R ontologies.

Result: Demonstrates that the intersection-based approach maintains security for full EDs, proves that answering BUCQs is in AC^0 data complexity for a subclass of EDs and DL-Lite_R ontologies, and shows practical feasibility through experimental evaluation in two different scenarios using the developed rewriting algorithm.

Conclusion: The intersection-based CQE approach with epistemic dependencies provides both strong security guarantees and favorable computational properties for ontology-based query answering, with the rewriting algorithm demonstrating practical applicability for controlled information disclosure in knowledge base systems.

Abstract: We investigate Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies, where
information disclosure is regulated by epistemic dependencies (EDs), a family
of logical rules recently proposed for the CQE framework. In particular, we
combine EDs with the notion of optimal GA censors, i.e. maximal sets of ground
atoms that are entailed by the ontology and can be safely revealed. We focus on
answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) with respect to the
intersection of all optimal GA censors - an approach that has been shown in
other contexts to ensure strong security guarantees with favorable
computational behavior. First, we characterize the security of this
intersection-based approach and identify a class of EDs (namely, full EDs) for
which it remains safe. Then, for a subclass of EDs and for DL-Lite_R
ontologies, we show that answering BUCQs in the above CQE semantics is in AC^0
in data complexity by presenting a suitable, detailed first-order rewriting
algorithm. Finally, we report on experiments conducted in two different
evaluation scenarios, showing the practical feasibility of our rewriting
function.

### [109] [Automated Hybrid Grounding Using Structural and Data-Driven Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17493)
*Alexander Beiser,Markus Hecher,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated hybrid grounding approach for Answer Set Programming that intelligently decides when to use body-decoupled grounding versus standard bottom-up grounding, using data-structural heuristics to improve performance on hard-to-ground scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The grounding bottleneck is a major obstacle preventing widespread industrial adoption of Answer Set Programming. While hybrid grounding combining standard bottom-up and body-decoupled techniques shows promise, it was unclear when to apply each method optimally.

Method: The authors develop a splitting algorithm based on data-structural heuristics that automatically determines when to use body-decoupled grounding versus standard grounding. The heuristics analyze rule structure and incorporate instance data through an estimation procedure.

Result: Experimental results on a prototypical implementation show promising improvements on hard-to-ground scenarios, while achieving near state-of-the-art performance on hard-to-solve instances.

Conclusion: Automated hybrid grounding successfully addresses the challenge of method selection in hybrid grounding approaches, demonstrating measurable improvements in grounding performance for Answer Set Programming applications.

Abstract: The grounding bottleneck poses one of the key challenges that hinders the
widespread adoption of Answer Set Programming in industry. Hybrid Grounding is
a step in alleviating the bottleneck by combining the strength of standard
bottom-up grounding with recently proposed techniques where rule bodies are
decoupled during grounding. However, it has remained unclear when hybrid
grounding shall use body-decoupled grounding and when to use standard bottom-up
grounding. In this paper, we address this issue by developing automated hybrid
grounding: we introduce a splitting algorithm based on data-structural
heuristics that detects when to use body-decoupled grounding and when standard
grounding is beneficial. We base our heuristics on the structure of rules and
an estimation procedure that incorporates the data of the instance. The
experiments conducted on our prototypical implementation demonstrate promising
results, which show an improvement on hard-to-ground scenarios, whereas on
hard-to-solve instances we approach state-of-the-art performance.

### [110] [Can One Domain Help Others? A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512)
*Yu Li,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Mengyuan Sun,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates multi-domain reasoning in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), studying how mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving interact when combined in RL training for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reasoning requires integrated application of multiple cognitive skills, but existing RLVR research focuses on isolated domains. The interplay among different reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood, creating a need for systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study uses GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-7B model family to conduct four key investigations: (1) evaluating in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization on single-domain datasets, (2) examining interactions during combined cross-domain training, (3) comparing base vs instruct models under identical RL configurations, and (4) exploring curriculum learning strategies, reward design variations, and language-specific factors.

Result: The extensive experiments reveal significant insights into domain interaction dynamics, identifying key factors that influence both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. The study uncovers mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training and demonstrates the impact of various RL training details on multi-domain reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs. The research establishes a framework for understanding how different reasoning domains interact under reinforcement learning and offers insights for developing more robust multi-domain reasoning systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing
research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as
mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real
world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of
multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning
skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this
gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the
RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a
comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO
algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the
models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities
when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the
intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge
during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence
of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base
and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we
delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts
of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and
language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer
significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing
key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning
performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL
methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

### [111] [TAI Scan Tool: A RAG-Based Tool With Minimalistic Input for Trustworthy AI Self-Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17514)
*Athanasios Davvetas,Xenia Ziouvelou,Ypatia Dami,Alexis Kaponis,Konstantina Giouvanopoulou,Michael Papademas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based self-assessment system that helps determine AI system risk levels under the AI Act with minimal input requirements, using a two-step pre-screening and assessment approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a practical tool to facilitate compliance with the AI Act by providing automated assessment of AI systems' risk levels and retrieving relevant regulatory articles with minimal user input.

Method: A two-step RAG-based approach consisting of: (1) a pre-screening phase and (2) an assessment phase that analyzes AI systems against AI Act requirements and retrieves relevant compliance articles.

Result: Qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios showed promising results with correct risk level predictions and successful retrieval of relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. The tool demonstrates reasoning capabilities by comparing systems with high-risk AI settings.

Conclusion: The TAI Scan Tool successfully provides automated TAI assessment for AI Act compliance with minimal input, showing effective risk level classification and relevant article retrieval, though its reasoning tends to focus on high-risk system comparisons due to their prominence in the AI Act.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool
with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI
assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI
Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment
phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the
risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time
retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their
obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields
promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant
articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of
results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting
of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring
careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.

### [112] [Constructing Ophthalmic MLLM for Positioning-diagnosis Collaboration Through Clinical Cognitive Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17539)
*Xinyao Liu,Diping Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal large language model that combines positioning and diagnosis reasoning capabilities, achieving superior performance in ophthalmic tasks through a novel dataset construction approach and clinically-aligned cognitive chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models face critical challenges in specialized medical domains like ophthalmology, including fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding and accurate medical diagnosis.

Method: The authors developed FundusExpert using FundusGen dataset constructed through the Fundus-Engine system, which automates localization and uses MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis. They constructed clinically aligned cognitive chains to guide interpretable reasoning paths and fine-tuned the model with instruction data.

Result: FundusExpert achieved best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing 40B MedRegA by 26.6% average accuracy. In zero-shot report generation, it achieved 77.0% clinical consistency compared to GPT-4o's 47.6%. The study revealed a scaling law between data quality and model capability (L ∝ N^0.068), showing improved data utilization efficiency.

Conclusion: The work successfully develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM for ophthalmology by integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, demonstrating a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specialized medical MLLMs and showing that cognitive alignment annotations enhance data utilization efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned
MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific
MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.

### [113] [Simulating multiple human perspectives in socio-ecological systems using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17680)
*Yongchao Zeng,Calum Brown,Ioannis Kyriakou,Ronja Hotz,Mark Rounsevell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoPeS, a simulation framework using LLM-powered agents to help users explore different stakeholder perspectives in socio-ecological systems, demonstrated through land use policy scenarios where users experience the challenges of being researchers trying to influence policy decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse stakeholder perspectives that are often difficult to access in real-world settings, necessitating alternative simulation-based approaches to explore these different viewpoints.

Method: The HoPeS framework employs LLM-powered agents to represent various stakeholders, with a simulation protocol that serves as a scaffold to guide users through perspective-taking simulations, allowing them to step into different agent roles and experience perspectival differences in institutional dynamics and land use change contexts.

Result: In the illustrative experiment, users experienced the frustration of being researchers whose technically sound policy recommendations were not implemented due to competing stakeholder advocacies, mirroring real-world researcher-policymaker misalignment, while still showing high motivation to explore alternative narrative strategies.

Conclusion: The HoPeS system demonstrates potential for exploring different perspectives in socio-ecological systems, with users gaining subjective insights into stakeholder challenges, and further refinement of the system and protocol could enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse
stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable
alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder
perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)
modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models
(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles
to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a
"scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting
users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across
perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the
context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both
narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a
user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher
- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform
evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various
institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound
policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and
implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world
misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's
reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment
as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political
neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user
exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing
strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different
perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new
forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

### [114] [Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17695)
*Ilias Chatzistefanidis,Navid Nikaein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces "symbiotic agents" that combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time optimization algorithms for 6G networks, achieving a fivefold reduction in decision errors compared to standalone LLM agents while maintaining near-real-time performance with significantly reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to transition from specialized AI algorithms handling isolated tasks to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks capable of real-time decision-making for network management and service provisioning in 6G networks, while ensuring trustworthy AI operation.

Method: Development of symbiotic agents combining LLMs with dual-level optimization: input-level optimizers providing bounded uncertainty steering for numerical precision, and output-level optimizers supervised by LLMs for adaptive real-time control. Implementation includes Radio Access Network optimizers and multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements.

Result: Symbiotic agents achieved fivefold reduction in decision errors compared to standalone LLM agents. Smaller language models demonstrated similar accuracy with 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and near-real-time performance (82ms loops). Multi-agent demonstration showed 44% reduction in RAN over-utilization with improved flexibility in service-level agreements.

Conclusion: The symbiotic paradigm combining LLMs with optimization algorithms provides a foundation for next-generation AGI-driven network systems that remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy, offering significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency for 6G network management.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a
vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time
decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users.
This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach,
where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to
artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess
broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with
real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic
agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty
steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers
supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and
implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,
and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We
further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on
a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show
that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone
LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy
with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of
82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world
testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and
resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.
Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the
symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven
networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even
as LLMs advance.

### [115] [Thinking Isn't an Illusion: Overcoming the Limitations of Reasoning Models via Tool Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17699)
*Zhao Song,Song Yue,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges recent findings that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) don't improve reasoning by showing that when augmented with tools like Python interpreters and scratchpads, LRMs consistently outperform non-reasoning models across all complexity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent empirical studies suggested that LRMs' step-by-step thinking processes may not actually enhance reasoning ability, with non-reasoning LLMs sometimes outperforming LRMs. The authors wanted to investigate whether these limitations persist when tool augmentations are introduced to LRMs.

Method: The researchers incorporated two types of tools (Python interpreters and scratchpads) and evaluated three representative LLMs and their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles across different complexity levels.

Result: With proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperformed their non-reasoning counterparts across all levels of task complexity, contradicting previous findings that suggested reasoning processes were ineffective.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion in LLMs and highlight the potential of tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems, suggesting that the combination of reasoning processes and appropriate tools can enhance performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large
language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a
step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle
complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,
[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not
actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning
actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we
revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist
when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,
Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and
their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show
that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the
recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of
tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated online competition system that streamlines the submission and evaluation process for research competitions by using isolated environments to handle large volumes of submissions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research communities face challenges in tracking progress across different venues and publications claiming state-of-the-art results. Traditional competitions have high operational burdens for organizers who must manage many submissions, and participants face compatibility issues due to diverse development environments.

Method: Development of an online competition system that automates submission and evaluation processes using isolated environments to evaluate submissions, allowing organizers to efficiently manage large numbers of submissions.

Result: The system has been successfully deployed and used for several competitions, including the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners competition, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The automated online competition system effectively addresses the operational challenges of research competitions by providing efficient submission management and evaluation through isolated environments, as evidenced by its successful implementation in multiple real-world competitions.

Abstract: Research communities have developed benchmark datasets across domains to
compare the performance of algorithms and techniques However, tracking the
progress in these research areas is not easy, as publications appear in
different venues at the same time, and many of them claim to represent the
state-of-the-art. To address this, research communities often organise periodic
competitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques,
thereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a
significant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large
volume of submissions. Furthermore, participants typically develop their
solutions in diverse environments, leading to compatibility issues during the
evaluation of their submissions. This paper presents an online competition
system that automates the submission and evaluation process for a competition.
The competition system allows organisers to manage large numbers of submissions
efficiently, utilising isolated environments to evaluate submissions. This
system has already been used successfully for several competitions, including
the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners
competition.

### [117] [A Unifying Scheme for Extractive Content Selection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16922)
*Shmuel Amar,Ori Shapira,Aviv Slobodkin,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework called instruction-guided content selection (IGCS) that uses language models with instructions to handle diverse text span selection tasks, introduces a benchmark and synthetic dataset, and demonstrates improved performance through transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content selection tasks (selecting relevant text spans from source texts) have been studied in isolation with separate modeling approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics, despite sharing the same core objective. There's a need for a unified framework to leverage commonalities across these tasks.

Method: The authors propose instruction-guided content selection (IGCS) framework where task definitions and instance-specific requests are encapsulated as instructions to language models. They create IGCSBench (a unified benchmark) and a large generic synthetic dataset for training across diverse content selection tasks.

Result: Transfer learning with the synthetic datasets often boosts performance across content selection tasks, both when dedicated training data is available and when it's not. The framework successfully unifies diverse content selection tasks under a single modeling approach.

Conclusion: The IGCS framework, benchmark, and synthetic datasets provide valuable resources for future content selection models. The unified approach addresses generic inference time issues in LLM-based content selection and demonstrates the utility of instruction-guided modeling for these tasks.

Abstract: A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given
source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection}
tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling
approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose
\textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified
framework for such settings, where the task definition and any
instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model.
To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified
benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large
generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection
tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts
performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or
not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based
modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall
propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection
models. Models and datasets available at https://github.com/shmuelamar/igcs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluated AI Consult, an LLM-based clinical decision support tool, in partnership with Penda Health clinics in Kenya. The tool reduced diagnostic errors by 16% and treatment errors by 13% across 39,849 patient visits, with all participating clinicians reporting improved care quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the real-world impact of large language model-based clinical decision support systems in live healthcare settings, addressing the need for tools that can reduce clinical errors while preserving clinician autonomy and integrating seamlessly into existing workflows.

Method: A quality improvement study was conducted across 15 primary care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits with and without AI Consult access. Independent physicians rated visits to identify clinical errors, and clinicians were surveyed about their experience with the tool. AI Consult was designed to activate only when needed and serve as a safety net for documentation and clinical decision-making.

Result: Clinicians using AI Consult made 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors compared to those without access. The tool would prevent approximately 22,000 diagnostic errors and 29,000 treatment errors annually at Penda Health alone. All surveyed clinicians reported that AI Consult improved care quality, with 75% describing the improvement as "substantial".

Conclusion: LLM-based clinical decision support tools like AI Consult can effectively reduce clinical errors in real-world healthcare settings when properly integrated into clinical workflows. The study provides a practical framework for responsible adoption of AI in healthcare, demonstrating that such tools can enhance care quality while maintaining clinician autonomy.

Abstract: We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision
support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary
care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a
safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical
decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,
activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a
quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits
performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.
Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.
Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer
diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the
introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and
treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of
clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the
quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial".
These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation
and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study
demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to
reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for
advancing responsible adoption.

### [119] [Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951)
*Shuyuan Lin,Lei Duan,Philip Hughes,Yuxuan Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SALU, a self-aware LLM that integrates unanswerability detection within its generative process to prevent hallucinations in conversational information retrieval systems by learning when to abstain from answering questions it cannot answer reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational Information Retrieval systems face the challenge of reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent generating misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches using external classifiers create inconsistencies with the core generative LLMs, necessitating a more integrated solution.

Method: SALU uses a multi-task learning framework that trains the LLM for both standard Question Answering and explicit abstention generation. It incorporates confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) that penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, integrating unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process.

Result: SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines including hybrid LLM-classifier systems in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions on the C-IR_Answerability dataset. Human evaluation shows superior reliability with high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and dramatic reduction in hallucination.

Conclusion: SALU demonstrates the ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'" by fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries, providing a more reliable solution for conversational information retrieval systems that reduces hallucination while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive
access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling
unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated
content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can
introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a
novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within
the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning
framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention
generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a
confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards
appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge
boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built
C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines,
including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly
answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms
SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate
abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination,

### [120] [Text-to-SPARQL Goes Beyond English: Multilingual Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs through Human-Inspired Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16971)
*Aleksandr Perevalov,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that uses coordinated LLM agents to convert multilingual natural language questions into SPARQL queries for knowledge graph question answering, achieving first place in the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accessing knowledge through multilingual natural-language interfaces is challenging in information retrieval. Prior approaches combined components for downstream tasks but lacked modularity and interpretability in transforming natural language into structured queries like SPARQL.

Method: The paper presents mKGQAgent, a modular framework that breaks down natural language to SPARQL conversion into interpretable subtasks using coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement, guided by an experience pool for in-context learning.

Result: mKGQAgent achieved first place among participants in the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, evaluated on DBpedia-based and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks, demonstrating effective handling of multilingual knowledge graph question answering.

Conclusion: The work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning systems in multilingual semantic parsing by providing a modular, interpretable approach to natural language to SPARQL query conversion using coordinated LLM agents.

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of
the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.
Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific
query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform
natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior
approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or
neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the
end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the
task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,
interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for
planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool
for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.
Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the
Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other
participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning
systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

*Rishemjit Kaur,Arshdeep Singh Bhankhar,Surangika Ranathunga,Jashanpreet Singh Salh,Sudhir Rajput,Vidhi,Kashish Mahendra,Bhavika Berwal,Ritesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study improves agricultural question-answering systems by creating multilingual synthetic datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs, resulting in more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services for diverse linguistic communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs provide generic agricultural advice lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Farmers need accurate agriculture-related information in their native languages for agricultural success.

Method: The researchers generated multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets from agriculture-specific documents in English, Hindi, and Punjabi, then fine-tuned language-specific LLMs using these synthetic datasets for improved agricultural question-answering performance.

Result: Evaluation on curated multilingual datasets showed significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in multilingual and low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning is an effective strategy to improve LLM performance in agriculture, enabling more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services and bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their
native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the
agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to
implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available
general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking
precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient
domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific
datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual
synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from
agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our
evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the
fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results
highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning
as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture,
especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate
and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful
step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for
diverse linguistic communities.

*Giulio Pelosio,Devesh Batra,Noémie Bovey,Robert Hankache,Cristovao Iglesias,Greig Cowan,Raad Khraishi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a name-based benchmarking approach to investigate nationality bias in LLMs by substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, finding that smaller models exhibit more bias and lower accuracy than larger counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can exhibit latent biases towards specific nationalities even without explicit demographic markers. The authors aim to investigate how substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names (reflecting real-world usage) affects bias and accuracy in LLMs.

Method: The researchers developed a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset, substituting explicit nationality references with culturally indicative names to examine bias magnitude and accuracy across various LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

Result: Small models showed higher bias and lower accuracy compared to larger models. Claude Haiku exhibited 9% stereotypical bias vs 3.5% for Claude Sonnet, with Sonnet outperforming by 117.7% in accuracy. GPT-4o retained 68% of error rate vs 76% for GPT-4o-mini when names replaced nationality references in ambiguous contexts.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the stubborn resilience of biases in LLMs, highlighting significant implications for AI system development and deployment in diverse, global contexts. Smaller models consistently exhibit more pronounced biases and retain higher error rates compared to their larger counterparts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific
nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this
work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the
Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting
explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more
reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this
substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs
from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments
show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to
their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the
ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku
exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for
its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by
117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger
portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after
substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of
the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other
model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn
resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the
development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

### [123] [Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17009)
*Ming Huang,Zehan Li,Yan Hu,Wanjing Wang,Andrew Wen,Scott Lane,Salih Selek,Lokesh Shahani,Rodrigo Machado-Vieira,Jair Soares,Hua Xu,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses generative large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5) for multi-label classification of suicidality-related factors from psychiatric electronic health records, achieving strong performance with finetuned GPT-3.5 (0.94 partial match accuracy) and demonstrating the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a global health crisis affecting over 720,000 deaths annually. Early identification of suicidality-related factors (including suicide ideation, attempts, exposure, and non-suicidal self-injury) is critical for timely intervention. Previous AI studies treated suicidality as binary classification, overlooking the complexity of co-occurring risk factors in clinical settings.

Method: The researchers developed a novel end-to-end generative multi-label classification pipeline using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5 models on psychiatric electronic health records. They introduced advanced evaluation methods including label set level metrics and multilabel confusion matrices for error analysis. The approach involved finetuning GPT-3.5 and using guided prompting with GPT-4.5.

Result: Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score. GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, particularly for rare or minority label sets, indicating more balanced and robust performance. The study revealed systematic error patterns such as conflation of suicide ideation and suicide attempts, and models' tendency toward cautious over-labeling.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks and provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large-scale clinical research and evidence-based medicine. The multi-label approach better captures the complexity of co-occurring suicidality risk factors compared to traditional binary classification methods.

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths
annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide
attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),
including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied
AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary
classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.
This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs
from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to
end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,
including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error
analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match
accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior
performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,
indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal
systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight
the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only
demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical
classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured
EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

### [124] [Can External Validation Tools Improve Annotation Quality for LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17015)
*Arduin Findeis,Floris Weers,Guoli Yin,Ke Ye,Ruoming Pang,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a tool-using agentic system that augments AI annotators with web search and code execution capabilities to improve pairwise preference evaluation of LLM responses, particularly for factual, math, and code domains where standard annotation approaches may be inadequate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pairwise preference annotation systems struggle with domains requiring factual accuracy, mathematical reasoning, or code correctness, as annotators may focus on superficial qualities like writing style rather than underlying correctness. High-quality pairwise comparisons are difficult to obtain from both human and AI annotators in these challenging domains.

Method: The authors develop a tool-using agentic system that enhances AI annotators with external validation tools including web search and code execution. This system grounds evaluations in external sources rather than relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge and biases, providing more objective feedback for factual, mathematical, and coding tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluation across RewardBench, RewardMath, and three new datasets shows that external tools improve annotation performance in many cases, though not universally. The results also reveal high sensitivity to simple parameters like prompts and highlight the need for better, non-saturated annotator benchmarks.

Conclusion: External tools can enhance AI annotator performance for challenging response domains, but the improvement is not guaranteed across all cases. The work emphasizes the importance of parameter sensitivity in annotation systems and the need for improved evaluation benchmarks that are not saturated by existing methods.

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate
and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative
model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better"
response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded
metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping
model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise
comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for
responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh
writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore
augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve
performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and
code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality
feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to
ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal
knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our
method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation
tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as
three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our
results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many,
but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity
of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved
(non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at

### [125] [Evolutionary Feature-wise Thresholding for Binary Representation of NLP Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17025)
*Soumen Sinha,Shahryar Rahnamayan,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework to find optimal feature-specific thresholds for converting continuous text embeddings (like BERT) into binary representations, achieving better performance than traditional fixed-threshold binarization methods while maintaining storage and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale NLP applications require efficient text embeddings where storage and computational efficiency are crucial. Traditional binarization methods use fixed thresholds across all features, which may not be optimal for different features that have varying characteristics and importance.

Method: The authors develop a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that identifies optimal thresholds for each individual feature rather than using a single fixed threshold. This approach creates feature-specific thresholds for converting continuous embeddings (such as BERT embeddings) into binary representations (barcodes).

Result: Extensive experiments and statistical tests across different NLP tasks and datasets show that binary embeddings generated using optimal feature-specific thresholds outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy while maintaining efficiency. The method demonstrates promising results across various NLP applications and shows versatility for application beyond just NLP embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed coordinate search optimization for feature-specific threshold selection successfully improves binary text representation accuracy compared to traditional fixed-threshold methods. The technique is versatile and applicable to any features beyond NLP embeddings, making it valuable for diverse machine learning applications requiring efficient binary representations.

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language
processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are
key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations
(barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings
derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common
method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often
using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate
Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal
threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead
to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary
representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across
various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising
results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform
text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests
on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to
other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal
thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in
accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and
can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it
useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

*Cheng Liu,Yifei Lu,Fanghua Ye,Jian Li,Xingyu Chen,Feiliang Ren,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogDual is a novel Role-Playing Language Agent that uses a cognize-then-respond reasoning paradigm, modeling both external situational awareness and internal self-awareness to improve character consistency and contextual alignment in role-playing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Role-Playing Language Agents rely mainly on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning but neglect the underlying cognitive mechanisms that drive character behaviors, leading to suboptimal performance in character consistency and contextual alignment.

Method: CogDual adopts a cognize-then-respond reasoning paradigm inspired by cognitive psychology, jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness. The approach is further optimized using reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on CoSER benchmark, Cross-MR, and LifeChoice datasets show that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

Conclusion: CogDual successfully addresses the limitations of existing RPLAs by incorporating cognitive mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in character consistency and contextual alignment while showing strong generalization capabilities across different role-playing scenarios.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant
application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches
typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models
to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the
underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by
cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a
\textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external
situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses
with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further
optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two
general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.
Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and
LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing
baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

### [127] [SKA-Bench: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Knowledge Understanding of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17178)
*Zhiqiang Liu,Enpei Niu,Yin Hua,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SKA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' understanding of structured knowledge (KG, Tables, KG+Text, Table+Text) across four fundamental abilities: noise robustness, order insensitivity, information integration, and negative rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for structured knowledge understanding in LLMs are non-rigorous, lacking specific capability assessments and focusing only on single types of structured knowledge. There's a need for more comprehensive and rigorous benchmarks to diagnose LLM shortcomings in structured knowledge understanding.

Method: The authors develop SKA-Bench using a three-stage pipeline to construct instances containing questions, answers, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. They evaluate four types of structured knowledge (KG, Table, KG+Text, Table+Text) across four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1) reveal that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge. Performance is notably influenced by factors such as noise amount, knowledge unit ordering, and hallucination phenomena.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have substantial limitations in structured knowledge understanding despite recent advances. The proposed SKA-Bench provides a rigorous framework for fine-grained evaluation of these capabilities and reveals specific areas where LLMs struggle, particularly with noise handling, order sensitivity, and hallucination issues.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations
for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific
capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a
more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to
diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a
Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used
structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a
three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a
question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To
evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we
expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,
Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical
evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,
indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding
structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as
the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination
phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FinGAIA, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents in financial tasks, containing 407 tasks across 7 financial sub-domains with 3 difficulty levels, revealing that even the best AI agent (ChatGPT) only achieves 48.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The financial sector's potential for AI agent automation remains underexplored despite the booming development of AI agents with multi-step, multi-tool collaboration capabilities, necessitating a specialized benchmark to evaluate their practical abilities in financial domains.

Method: Created FinGAIA benchmark with 407 meticulously crafted tasks spanning 7 financial sub-domains (securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts, asset management) organized into 3 hierarchical difficulty levels (basic business analysis, asset decision support, strategic risk management), then evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in zero-shot settings.

Result: ChatGPT achieved the best performance with 48.9% overall accuracy, which exceeds non-professionals but falls short of financial experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis identified 5 recurring failure patterns including Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial Terminological Bias, and Operational Process Awareness Barrier.

Conclusion: Current AI agents significantly underperform compared to financial experts, with identified failure patterns providing crucial directions for future research. FinGAIA serves as the first agent benchmark specifically designed for financial domain assessment and development.

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for
automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step,
multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain
underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed
to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain.
FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major
financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts,
and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels
of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and
strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot
setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of
48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial
experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five
recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial
Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These
patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the
first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to
objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

### [129] [The Pluralistic Moral Gap: Understanding Judgment and Value Differences between Humans and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17216)
*Giuseppe Russo,Debora Nozza,Paul Röttger,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark dataset of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas to evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) align with human moral judgments, finding significant gaps in both judgment distribution and moral value diversity, then proposes Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP) to improve alignment by 64.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As people increasingly rely on LLMs for moral advice that may influence human decisions, there is a critical need to understand how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments, particularly given the lack of existing knowledge about this alignment.

Method: The researchers created the Moral Dilemma Dataset with 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with human judgments (binary evaluations and rationales), treated alignment as a pluralistic distributional task, built a 60-value taxonomy from 3,783 value expressions, and developed Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP) - a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles.

Result: LLMs only reproduce human judgments under high consensus and alignment deteriorates when human disagreement increases. LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans, revealing a "pluralistic moral gap" in both distribution and diversity of values. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity.

Conclusion: There exists a significant pluralistic moral gap between LLMs and humans in both judgment distribution and moral value diversity. The proposed Dynamic Moral Profiling method offers a promising approach toward achieving more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice,
which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely
LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral
Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a
distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a
free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional
alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across
dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high
consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In
parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions
extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral
values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch
in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,
we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method
that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves
alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more
pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

### [130] [CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234)
*Kyeongkyu Lee,Seonghwan Yoon,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARIFID is a novel framework for automatic radiology report generation that mimics expert radiologists' two-step workflow (Findings → Impression) and uses multi-view chest X-rays with reinforcement learning to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic radiology report generation methods struggle with clinical reliability, focusing on fluent text generation rather than factual correctness, and are limited by single-view image analysis, which reduces diagnostic comprehensiveness.

Method: CLARIFID employs: (1) section-aware pretraining to learn Findings-to-Impression logical flow, (2) Proximal Policy Optimization fine-tuning with CheXbert F1 score as reward, (3) reasoning-aware decoding that completes Findings before Impression synthesis, (4) vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder for chest X-ray fusion, and (5) inference-time reasoning-aware next-token forcing with report-level re-ranking.

Result: Experimental results on MIMIC-CXR dataset show CLARIFID achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on both standard natural language generation metrics and clinically aware scores.

Conclusion: CLARIFID successfully addresses the clinical reliability challenge in automatic radiology report generation by directly optimizing diagnostic correctness through expert workflow mimicry, multi-view integration, and reasoning-aware generation strategies.

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate
radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver
clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on
producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of
the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic
comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly
optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts.
Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression
through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy
Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as
the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings"
before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views
via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a
reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level
re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings
section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent
clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing
baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

text-based large language models while incorporating domain-specific
adaptations. To further enhance multilingual recognition performance, we
adopted a meticulously designed multi-stage training strategy leveraging
extensive multilingual audio datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves competitive Word Error Rate (WER) performance on both dev
and test sets, obtaining second place in the challenge ranking.

*Zhili Shen,Chenxin Diao,Pascual Merita,Pavlos Vougiouklis,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper adapts the state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution GeAR for the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge to evaluate its general applicability beyond specific tasks like multi-hop QA and query-focused summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based retrieval-augmented generation methods are typically designed for specific tasks (multi-hop question answering, query-focused summarization) with limited evidence of general applicability across broader datasets, creating a need to evaluate their performance in more diverse scenarios.

Method: The authors adapt GeAR, a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution that leverages structured/semi-structured information (entities and relations extracted from documents), and test it on the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge dataset.

Result: The paper explores the performance and limitations of the adapted GeAR system on the LiveRAG Challenge, though specific performance metrics are not provided in this abstract.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the general applicability of graph-based RAG approaches beyond their original specific task domains, revealing both capabilities and limitations when applied to broader datasets through the LiveRAG Challenge evaluation.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented
generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as
entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval.
However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such
as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore,
there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader
datasets. In this paper, we aim to adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG
solution: $\text{GeAR}$ and explore its performance and limitations on the
SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

### [133] [Investigating Subjective Factors of Argument Strength: Storytelling, Emotions, and Hedging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17409)
*Carlotta Quensel,Neele Falk,Gabriella Lapesa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how subjective factors (emotions, storytelling, and hedging) impact argument strength across objective quality and subjective persuasion dimensions through regression analysis on annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale analyses examining the relationship between subjective features and argument strength, despite the growing recognition of subjectivity as valuable in NLP and the existence of studies on individual subjective features.

Method: The authors conduct regression analysis to quantify the impact of three subjective factors (emotions, storytelling, and hedging) on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality and subjective persuasion. They also compare and evaluate automated annotation methods for each subjective feature.

Result: Storytelling and hedging show contrasting effects on objective versus subjective argument quality. The influence of emotions on argument strength depends on their rhetorical utilization rather than the specific domain. Different patterns of impact emerge for subjective features across the two facets of argument strength.

Conclusion: Subjective factors have measurable and distinct impacts on different dimensions of argument strength, with storytelling and hedging showing opposing effects on objective and subjective quality, while emotional impact varies based on rhetorical usage rather than domain-specific factors.

Abstract: In assessing argument strength, the notions of what makes a good argument are
manifold. With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and
not a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although
studies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is
a lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and
argument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to
quantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and
hedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality
and subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level
of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied
dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for
each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression
analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the
two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that
storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective
argument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric
utilization rather than the domain.

### [134] [Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442)
*Shiting Chen,Zijian Zhao,Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by combining multiple embedding models: Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG, with Confident RAG showing superior performance by selecting responses with highest confidence levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different embedding models in RAG systems exhibit varying benefits across domains due to heterogeneous training data and architectures, leading to inconsistent similarity calculations and varying response quality from LLMs. The authors aim to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple embedding models to improve RAG performance.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) Mixture-Embedding RAG - sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity scores, and (2) Confident RAG - generates multiple responses using different embedding models and selects the response with the highest confidence level.

Result: Mixture-Embedding RAG does not outperform vanilla RAG. However, Confident RAG demonstrates significant improvements with approximately 10% better performance over vanilla LLMs and 5% improvement over standard RAG. The results are consistent across different LLMs and embedding models.

Conclusion: Confident RAG emerges as an efficient plug-and-play approach that can be applied across various domains to enhance RAG performance by leveraging multiple embedding models through confidence-based response selection, while the simpler mixture approach proves ineffective.

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various
fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or
adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered
wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an
inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort
for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model
architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different
benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity
calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To
address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by
combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding
RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects
retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;
however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG
generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then
selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average
improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,
respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models
indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various
domains. We will release our code upon publication.

### [135] [MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476)
*Alexander R. Fabbri,Diego Mares,Jorge Flores,Meher Mankikar,Ernesto Hernandez,Dean Lee,Bing Liu,Chen Xing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiNRC, a multilingual reasoning benchmark with over 1,000 native questions in French, Spanish, and Chinese to evaluate LLMs' multilingual reasoning capabilities. Results show that current LLMs struggle with native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50%, and perform significantly better in English than in original languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are biased towards English by simply translating English benchmarks, failing to capture authentic linguistic and cultural reasoning contexts. There is a need for genuine multilingual evaluation that reflects native speakers' reasoning patterns and cultural knowledge across different languages.

Method: The authors created MultiNRC with 1,000+ native reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese across four categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and culturally relevant math reasoning. They provided English translations for some categories to enable direct comparison and systematically evaluated 14 leading LLMs on both the original multilingual questions and English equivalents.

Result: All 14 evaluated LLMs scored below 50% on MultiNRC, demonstrating poor native multilingual reasoning performance. LLMs showed varying strengths across different reasoning categories (linguistic, cultural, logical). Most models performed substantially better (+10%) on math reasoning in English compared to original languages, revealing persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in native multilingual reasoning capabilities, particularly struggling with culturally grounded knowledge and language-specific reasoning tasks. The substantial performance gap between English and original languages indicates that LLMs have not yet achieved truly multilingual reasoning competency, highlighting the need for better multilingual training approaches.

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on
reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual
reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains
limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed
by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks
towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this
work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a
benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and
culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,
Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:
language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition
reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition
reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English
equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation
from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can
provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.
English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14
leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent
set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native
multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and
logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math
reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating
persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 is an end-to-end simultaneous interpretation model that achieves high-quality, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech translation with voice cloning, reducing latency by ~70% (from 10s to 3s) while maintaining over 70% translation accuracy in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic simultaneous interpretation systems suffer from poor transcription/translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and speech inflation issues, especially in long-form discourses. There's a need for a product-level solution that can deliver high-fidelity, real-time interpretation.

Method: The paper introduces a novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework combined with large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning to create an end-to-end simultaneous interpretation model with voice cloning capabilities.

Result: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 achieves over 70% correctness in complex scenarios as validated by human interpreters, outperforms commercial SI solutions in translation quality, and reduces average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to 3 seconds (approximately 70% reduction).

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses the key challenges in simultaneous interpretation by achieving a superior balance between translation accuracy and latency, making it a viable product-level solution that significantly enhances practical usability for real-time interpretation applications.

Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting
frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems
long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation
quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and
translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study,
we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers
high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning
capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret
2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech
understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that
through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves
a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency,
validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios.
Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by
significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency
of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is
around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.

### [137] [Synthetic Voice Data for Automatic Speech Recognition in African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17578)
*Brian DeRenzi,Anna Dixon,Mohamed Aymane Farhi,Christian Resch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic assessment of using synthetic voice data for African language Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrating that synthetic data can significantly reduce costs while maintaining or improving ASR performance across multiple African languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech technology is inaccessible for most of the 2300+ African languages due to lack of training data. Real speech data collection is expensive and time-consuming, creating a barrier for developing ASR systems for low-resource African languages.

Method: A three-step approach: (1) LLM-driven text creation for generating training content, (2) TTS voice synthesis to create artificial speech data, and (3) ASR fine-tuning using Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models with combinations of real and synthetic data across three African languages (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa).

Result: Created over 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at <1% cost of real data. For Hausa, 250h real + 250h synthetic data matched 500h real-data baseline performance. Best results achieved with 579h real + 450-993h synthetic data. Chichewa showed 6.5% relative WER improvement with 1:2 real-to-synthetic ratio. Results varied for very low-resource languages like Dholuo.

Conclusion: Synthetic voice data can effectively augment real data for African ASR systems at dramatically reduced costs. However, effectiveness varies by language and data ratios. The study reveals need for more robust evaluation protocols and better evaluation datasets. All data and models are publicly released to advance African language speech technology.

Abstract: Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in
Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic
voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text
creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages
for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of
7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created
more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real
data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h
synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and
450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present
gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource
languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2
real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on
some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability,
ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer
protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly
released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African
languages.

### [138] [A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17618)
*Bowen Zheng,Ming Ma,Zhongqiao Lin,Tianming Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPADE, a novel decoding method that improves early-exit algorithms for large language models by aligning intermediate layer representations with output layers, significantly reducing inference costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep structures, and existing early-exit algorithms suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations, leading to decoding inaccuracy.

Method: SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding) aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence of only the start token and answer token. The method also includes training a linear approximation that computes entropy-based confidence metrics for optimized early-exit decision-making, creating a hybrid early-exit algorithm.

Result: The hybrid early-exit algorithm with SPADE successfully reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, providing a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models.

Conclusion: SPADE offers an effective approach to address the computational challenges of large language models by improving early-exit strategies through better representation alignment, enabling practical deployment in real-world applications while maintaining performance quality.

Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep
structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain
sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development
of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation
at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance
due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that
lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE
(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate
layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced
sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further
optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear
approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting
them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence
levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate
high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs
without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for
deploying large language models in real-world applications.

*Mohammed Bouri,Adnane Saoud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Growth Bound Matrices (GBM), a novel regularization technique to improve adversarial robustness of NLP models against synonym substitution attacks, with focus on LSTM, S4 state space models, and CNNs, achieving up to 8.8% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks like synonym substitutions, and while robustness has been studied for feed-forward and convolutional architectures, recurrent networks and modern state space models (SSMs) like S4 are understudied due to their sequential processing and complex parameter dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a novel regularization technique based on Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to reduce the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. They compute GBM for three specific architectures: LSTM, State Space models (S4), and CNNs to enhance model robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark datasets show that the GBM method improves adversarial robustness by up to 8.8% over existing baselines, outperforming several state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods while also improving generalization on clean text.

Conclusion: The Growth Bound Matrices regularization technique effectively enhances adversarial robustness for NLP models, particularly for understudied architectures like S4 state space models, providing both improved defense against word substitution attacks and better generalization, representing the first systematic analysis of SSM robustness.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

*Changxin Tian,Jiapeng Wang,Qian Zhao,Kunlong Chen,Jia Liu,Ziqi Liu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WSM (Warmup-Stable and Merge) is a framework that replaces traditional learning rate decay with model merging techniques, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks by treating decay strategies as principled model averaging schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning rate scheduling relies on decay phases, but recent decay-free approaches using model merging have shown promise. There's a need for a unified theoretical framework that connects learning rate decay with model merging to achieve competitive performance without traditional decay.

Method: The paper presents WSM (Warmup-Stable and Merge), a framework that emulates various decay strategies (cosine, linear, inverse square root) as principled model averaging schemes. The method focuses on merge duration (training window for checkpoint aggregation) as the key factor, while being compatible with diverse optimization methods.

Result: WSM consistently outperforms the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach with significant improvements: +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The framework also shows advantages in supervised fine-tuning scenarios. Merge duration was identified as the most critical factor, more important than checkpoint interval and merge quantity.

Conclusion: WSM provides a unified theoretical foundation for connecting learning rate decay and model merging, demonstrating that decay strategies can be effectively replaced by model averaging schemes. The framework's superior performance and compatibility with various optimization methods highlight its potential for long-term model refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the
effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay
phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have
emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present
Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal
connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a
unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including
cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model
averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization
methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training
window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model
performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge
quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving
significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on
MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning
scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

*Victor Hartman,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning and uses this method to analyze 18 million tweets from parliamentarians across 19 European countries, revealing that governing parties use less negative messaging while extreme and populist parties (especially radical right) engage in more negativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on negative campaigning has been limited by high costs and scalability issues of traditional classification methods, creating a need for more efficient and scalable approaches to study political communication across different languages and countries.

Method: The study employs zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning, benchmarked against datasets in ten languages and compared with human coders and conventional supervised machine learning approaches. This method is then applied to analyze 18 million tweets from parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017-2022.

Result: LLMs achieved performance comparable to native-speaking human coders and outperformed conventional supervised machine learning approaches. The analysis revealed consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties, particularly those on the radical right, engage in significantly higher levels of negativity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLMs can enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts, while advancing understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems.

Abstract: Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet
empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of
existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,
it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for
cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets
in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with
native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine
learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the
largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18
million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017
and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing
parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme
and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in
significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our
understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication
in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of
LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political
communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

### [142] [Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17702)
*Changxin Tian,Kunlong Chen,Jia Liu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Efficiency Leverage (EL) as a metric to predict the computational advantage of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models over dense models, deriving scaling laws through training 300+ models up to 28B parameters and validating with a pilot model that achieves 7x computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures efficiently scale Large Language Models by decoupling total parameters from computational cost, but predicting model capacity for different MoE configurations remains an unresolved challenge that hinders optimal architecture design.

Method: The authors define Efficiency Leverage (EL) as a metric to quantify MoE computational advantage, conduct large-scale empirical study training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, systematically investigate relationships between MoE configurations and EL, and derive unified scaling laws based on expert activation ratio, compute budget, and expert granularity.

Result: EL follows predictable power laws driven by expert activation ratio and total compute budget, with expert granularity acting as a non-linear modulator with optimal range. The pilot model Ling-mini-beta (0.85B active parameters) matched performance of 6.1B dense model while using 7x fewer computational resources, validating the derived scaling laws.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled, empirically-grounded foundation for scaling efficient MoE models by providing unified scaling laws that accurately predict computational efficiency based on architectural configurations, enabling better MoE design decisions.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large
Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from
computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:
predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert
activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address
this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the
computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a
large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to
systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural
configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the
expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following
predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator
with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified
scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its
configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained
Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active
parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an
identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance
of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,
thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a
principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE
models.

### [143] [TyDi QA-WANA: A Benchmark for Information-Seeking Question Answering in Languages of West Asia and North Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17709)
*Parker Riley,Siamak Shakeri,Waleed Ammar,Jonathan H. Clark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyDi QA-WANA is a new question-answering dataset with 28K examples across 10 language varieties from western Asia and northern Africa, designed to evaluate models' ability to answer information-seeking questions using large text contexts without relying on translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA datasets lack representation of western Asian and northern African languages, and many datasets rely on translation which can cause cultural relevance issues. There's a need for authentic, culturally relevant QA data collected directly in native languages to better evaluate multilingual QA systems.

Method: The researchers collected 28K question-answer examples across 10 language varieties from western Asia and northern Africa. The data collection was designed to elicit genuine information-seeking questions where askers are truly curious about the answers. Each question is paired with entire articles that may or may not contain the answer, creating a challenging context-based QA task. Importantly, all data was collected directly in each target language without using translation.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive multilingual QA dataset spanning 10 underrepresented language varieties with 28K examples. Two baseline models were evaluated on the dataset, establishing initial performance benchmarks. The relatively large article contexts create a challenging evaluation scenario for testing models' long-context reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: TyDi QA-WANA provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual QA research in underrepresented languages from western Asia and northern Africa. By avoiding translation and collecting data directly in native languages, the dataset addresses cultural relevance issues while offering a challenging evaluation benchmark for long-context QA models. The release of code and data aims to facilitate further research community improvements.

Abstract: We present TyDi QA-WANA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 28K
examples divided among 10 language varieties of western Asia and northern
Africa. The data collection process was designed to elicit information-seeking
questions, where the asker is genuinely curious to know the answer. Each
question in paired with an entire article that may or may not contain the
answer; the relatively large size of the articles results in a task suitable
for evaluating models' abilities to utilize large text contexts in answering
questions. Furthermore, the data was collected directly in each language

### [144] [From Feedback to Checklists: Grounded Evaluation of AI-Generated Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17717)
*Karen Zhou,John Giorgi,Pranav Mani,Peng Xu,Davis Liang,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a systematic pipeline to convert real physician feedback into structured checklists for evaluating AI-generated clinical notes, using data from over 21,000 clinical encounters to create more reliable and interpretable evaluation metrics that better align with clinician preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI-generated clinical notes is challenging due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review, while existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences, creating a need for better evaluation methodologies.

Method: The researchers propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured, interpretable checklists for note evaluation, using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters from a deployed AI medical scribe system and implementing LLM-based evaluators to enforce these checklists.

Result: The feedback-derived checklist outperformed baseline approaches in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings, demonstrated robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, showed significant alignment with clinician preferences, and proved effective at identifying notes likely to fall below quality thresholds.

Conclusion: The structured checklist methodology provides a practical and robust evaluation framework for AI-generated clinical notes that bridges the gap between automated metrics and physician preferences, offering a scalable solution for quality assessment in healthcare AI applications.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but
evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and
limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to
align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a
pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured
checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be
interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based
evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,
prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI
medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms
baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and
predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the
checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant
alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation
methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify
notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

*Danny D. Leybzon,Shreyas Tirumala,Nishant Jain,Summer Gillen,Michael Jackson,Cameron McPhee,Jennifer Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an AI telephone survey system using LLMs, ASR, and speech synthesis to conduct quantitative surveys with human-like interactivity while maintaining methodological rigor, showing that shorter instruments and responsive AI lead to better completion rates and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional telephone surveys face scalability challenges, and while IVR systems exist, they lack natural conversational ability. The rise of voice AI presents an opportunity to create more human-like, adaptive survey experiences that can handle speech interruptions and corrections while maintaining research standards.

Method: Built an AI survey system combining large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was designed specifically for quantitative research, incorporating best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording adherence. Conducted two pilot surveys with SSRS Opinion Panel followed by human-administered follow-up surveys.

Result: Evaluated the system using three metrics: survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Results indicated that shorter survey instruments and more responsive AI interviewers contributed to improvements across all three measured metrics.

Conclusion: AI telephone surveying represents a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering scalable quantitative data collection with human-like interactivity. The study demonstrates that voice AI can maintain methodological rigor while providing a more natural respondent experience, with performance improvements linked to survey length and AI responsiveness.

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI
telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can
scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like
interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used
interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI
enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust
to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on
large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech
synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative
research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order
randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot
surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate
human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three
key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent
satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more
responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three
metrics studied.

Abstract: We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model
architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel
cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total
parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers
while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated

Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and
further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with

Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to
larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding,
instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These

### [147] [Pretraining on the Test Set Is No Longer All You Need: A Debate-Driven Approach to QA Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17747)
*Linbo Cao,Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a debate-driven evaluation method that converts existing QA datasets into adversarial debates between models, where one defends the correct answer and another defends an alternative, judged by a blind model. This approach increases difficulty, reduces memorization effects, and provides a cost-effective way to evaluate language models' genuine reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard QA benchmarks are becoming saturated by frontier language models, raising concerns about data contamination, memorization, and the high costs of creating new evaluation datasets. There's a need for evaluation methods that can assess genuine reasoning ability rather than memorized knowledge while being cost-effective and scalable.

Method: The authors develop an evaluation pipeline that systematically converts QA tasks into structured adversarial debates. In this framework, one model defends the official correct answer while another constructs and defends an alternative answer. A judge model, blind to the correct solution, adjudicates the multi-round argumentation. This transforms existing QA datasets into more challenging assessments without requiring new dataset creation.

Result: Empirical validation shows the method's robustness and effectiveness against data contamination. A Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements on standard QA (50% to 82%) but performed worse in debates. The results demonstrate that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, and the method successfully penalizes shallow memorization while increasing evaluation difficulty.

Conclusion: The debate-driven evaluation paradigm offers a sustainable and cost-effective path for measuring genuine reasoning abilities of advanced language models. It demonstrates that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need" and provides a scalable solution that can adapt to future, more capable systems while maintaining evaluation rigor at a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,
concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset
creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that
transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where
one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and
defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the
correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach
substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet
reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:
(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based
assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's
effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized
protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of
the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model
fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)
but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can
reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based
evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a
fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework
underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,"
offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of
advanced language models.

### [148] [Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for the Standardization of Transtibial Prosthetic Socket Shape Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16818)
*C. H. E. Jordaan,M. van der Stelt,T. J. J. Maal,V. M. A. Stirler,R. Leijendekkers,T. Kachman,G. A. de Jong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops AI approaches to standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design by training algorithms on 118 patient datasets to predict socket shapes from residual limb scans, with random forest showing best performance when predicting prosthetist adaptations rather than final socket shapes directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quality of transtibial prosthetic sockets depends heavily on individual prosthetist skills and manual fitting expertise, creating inconsistencies in socket design. The study aims to use AI to help standardize the prosthetic socket design process and reduce reliance on manual expertise.

Method: The researchers collected 3D scans of residual limbs and corresponding prosthetist-designed sockets from 118 patients in the Dutch healthcare system. They applied data preprocessing including alignment, standardization, and compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis. Three AI algorithms were developed: 3D neural network, feedforward neural network, and random forest, tested on two prediction approaches - direct socket shape prediction and prosthetist adaptation prediction.

Result: All algorithms performed better when predicting prosthetist adaptations rather than directly predicting final socket shapes. The random forest model achieved the best performance with a median surface-to-surface distance error of 1.24mm, first quartile of 1.03mm, and third quartile of 1.54mm when applied to adaptation prediction.

Conclusion: AI approaches, particularly random forest models predicting prosthetist adaptations, can effectively assist in standardizing transtibial prosthetic socket design with clinically acceptable accuracy, potentially reducing dependence on individual prosthetist expertise and improving consistency in socket fitting.

Abstract: The quality of a transtibial prosthetic socket depends on the prosthetist's
skills and expertise, as the fitting is performed manually. This study
investigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help
standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were
collected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data
consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a
corresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data
pre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and
optionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.
Afterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural
network, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final
socket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the
socket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's
performance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the
AI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.
First, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface
error between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.
Second, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are
utilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the
required adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.
The random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest
error with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first
quartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an automated workflow to detect and correct noisy features in self-driving laboratories for materials discovery, using kNN imputation to recover correct feature values and improve data quality in automated experimental platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) show promise for accelerating materials discovery through ML and automated experiments, but errors in input parameter capture can corrupt features used for modeling, compromising both current and future experimental campaigns. There's a need for systematic approaches to handle noisy data in automated materials discovery.

Method: The authors develop an automated workflow that: (1) systematically detects noisy features, (2) determines which sample-feature pairings can be corrected, and (3) recovers correct feature values using kNN imputation. They conduct systematic studies examining how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value distribution affect noise detectability and recoverability.

Result: High-intensity noise and large training datasets facilitate better detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity noise reduces detection/recovery performance but can be compensated by larger clean datasets. Features with continuous and dispersed distributions show greater recoverability compared to discrete or narrow distributions. The framework provides a model-agnostic approach for data recovery and establishes benchmarks for kNN imputation in materials datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a robust framework for rational data recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and varying feature distributions in automated materials discovery. This approach enhances data quality and experimental precision in self-driving laboratories, providing both practical tools and theoretical insights for handling noisy data in materials research.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that combines hyperbolic Transformers with reinforcement learning to improve multi-step reasoning tasks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy (32-45%) and computational efficiency (16-32%) compared to vanilla transformer-based RL on mathematical and control problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL methods struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to credit assignment problems, high-dimensional state representations, and stability issues. While RL shows promise for multi-step reasoning through long-term reward optimization, there's a need for better approaches that can handle hierarchical structures more effectively.

Method: The paper proposes integrating hyperbolic Transformers into reinforcement learning frameworks. The approach uses hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively, combining recent advancements in Transformer architectures with hyperbolic geometry to address the limitations of conventional RL methods.

Result: The hyperbolic RL framework achieves substantial improvements over vanilla transformer-based RL: 32-44% accuracy improvement on FrontierMath benchmark, 43-45% on nonlinear optimal control benchmark, while reducing computational time by 16-32% on FrontierMath and 16-17% on nonlinear optimal control problems.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that hyperbolic Transformers have significant potential in reinforcement learning, especially for multi-step reasoning tasks involving hierarchical structures. The framework successfully addresses key challenges in RL while providing both accuracy and computational efficiency gains.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence,
with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making
in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in
enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term

architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these
challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic
Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages
hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present
theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that
include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL
with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by
(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control

Conclusion: DiffCarl represents a practical and forward-looking solution for intelligent microgrid operation that successfully combines environmental consciousness with operational efficiency, offering a flexible design that supports real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware

### [154] [Confidence Optimization for Probabilistic Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16881)
*Pengjiu Xia,Yidian Huang,Wenchao Wei,Yuwen Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Confidence optimization Probabilistic Encoding (CPE), a model-agnostic method that improves probabilistic encoding in neural networks by introducing confidence-aware distance calculations and replacing KL divergence with L2 regularization to enhance classification performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic encoding with Gaussian noise enhances generalization but distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks due to the randomness of the noise, creating reliability issues in distance calculations that need to be addressed.

Method: The CPE method uses two key strategies: (1) a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations for consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification, and (2) replacing KL divergence-based variance regularization with simpler L2 regularization to directly constrain variance without relying on unreliable prior assumptions.

Result: Extensive experiments on natural language classification tasks show that CPE significantly improves performance and generalization on both BERT and RoBERTa models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model-agnostic approach.

Conclusion: The confidence optimization probabilistic encoding method successfully addresses the distance measurement distortion problem in probabilistic encoding, providing a model-agnostic solution that enhances both classification performance and generalization ability across different neural network architectures.

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks,
enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and
enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise
distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE)
method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning.
Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First,
we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations,
ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification
tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance
regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2
regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is
model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification
tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and
generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

*Yi Guo,Wei Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Rong Cao,Kuan Chen,Zhengyang Chen,Yuanyuan Huo,Yang Zhang,Yuping Wang,Shouda Liu,Yuxuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplitMeanFlow introduces a novel algebraic approach to learning average velocity fields for fast generative modeling, replacing differential formulations with interval splitting consistency, achieving 20x speedups in real-world speech synthesis applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models like Flow Matching suffer from computationally expensive iterative sampling processes. While MeanFlow addressed this by learning average velocity fields through differential identities, the differential formulation is computationally expensive and represents a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle.

Method: The authors derive a purely algebraic identity called "Interval Splitting Consistency" based on the additivity property of definite integrals. This establishes a self-referential relationship for average velocity fields across different time intervals without differential operators. SplitMeanFlow enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective, eliminating the need for JVP (Jacobian-Vector Product) computations.

Result: SplitMeanFlow demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency with simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step models achieve 20x speedups and have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products like Doubao. The method formally recovers MeanFlow's differential identity as a limiting case.

Conclusion: SplitMeanFlow provides a more general and efficient foundation for learning average velocity fields in generative models. The algebraic approach eliminates computational bottlenecks while maintaining theoretical rigor, making it practical for large-scale deployment with substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art
performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative
sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or
one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps
noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by
enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous
velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a
limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first
principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite
integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term
Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential
relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals
without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we
introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic
consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the
differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit
of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This
establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning
average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is
significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,
resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware
compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been
successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as
Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

*Steven K. Esser,Jeffrey L. McKinstry,Deepika Bablani,Rathinakumar Appuswamy,Dharmendra S. Modha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple quantization-aware training approach for large language models that achieves superior performance compared to existing methods with minimal training overhead (less than 0.1% increase) and no additional operations beyond quantization itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of quantizing large language models to reduce inference latency, model size, and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Existing quantization methods either suffer from significant accuracy loss or require mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators, creating a need for better quantization techniques.

Method: The paper proposes an end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that is simple and generalizable across different model architectures. The method can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and crucially requires no additional operations beyond the quantization process itself, making it compatible with specialized inference accelerators.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, tested on both base and instruct model variants. This superior performance is achieved with only a minimal increase (less than 0.1%) in the total model training budget.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that effective quantization of large language models can be achieved through a simple, end-to-end training approach that maintains compatibility with inference accelerators while delivering significant performance improvements over existing methods with negligible additional training cost.

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

### [157] [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Walking Control Using General Value Functions of Lower-Limb Sensor Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16983)
*Sonny T. Jones,Grange M. Simpson,Patrick M. Pilarski,Ashley N. Dalrymple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning approach for adaptive lower-limb exoskeleton control using predictive sensor information from General Value Functions to improve terrain classification and decision-making during walking across varied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance mobility and autonomy for individuals with motor impairments by developing adaptive control strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons that can effectively handle the complex task of terrain adaptation during ambulation.

Method: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with two levels: higher-level terrain strategy adaptation and lower-level predictive information provision through continual learning of General Value Functions (GVFs). GVFs generate temporal abstractions from multiple wearable sensors (EMG, pressure insoles, goniometers) to provide predictive information for policy network decision-making.

Result: Adding GVF predictions increased overall network accuracy and improved terrain-specific performance on even ground, uneven ground, ramps, and turns - terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. Predictive information particularly aided decision-making during uncertainty and high misclassification scenarios.

Conclusion: Predictive information from GVFs can significantly improve exoskeleton control decision-making during terrain uncertainty, contributing new insights into HRL applications and advancing the development of safer exoskeletons for transitioning across different walking environments.

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning
and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the
use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control
strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy
for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of
biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down
the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level
framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for
providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the
continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal
abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,
including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated
two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy
network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control
system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As
a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs
increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were
seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,
terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This
suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during
uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified.
This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the
future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and
traversing across different walking environments.

### [159] [Should Bias Always be Eliminated? A Principled Framework to Use Data Bias for OOD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17001)
*Yan Li,Guangyi Chen,Yunlong Deng,Zijian Li,Zeyu Tang,Anpeng Wu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework that strategically leverages bias instead of eliminating it to improve out-of-distribution domain adaptation, using bias both directly and indirectly to complement invariant representations during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing OOD domain adaptation methods focus on eliminating biased features through invariant representation learning, but this raises fundamental questions about whether bias should always be eliminated and how it could be beneficially leveraged when retained.

Method: The framework has two key components: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate environmental conditions and explore appropriate bias-aware predictors to bridge environment gaps.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization benchmarks consistently show the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating superior robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: Strategic leveraging of bias can complement invariant representations effectively for OOD domain adaptation, challenging the conventional wisdom of always eliminating bias and providing a new paradigm for handling domain shifts.

Abstract: Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)
domains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of
biased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when
should it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,
we first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under
which biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on
this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically
leverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The
framework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and
indirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive
ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the
environmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware
predictors to alleviate environment gaps. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization
benchmarks. Results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, underscoring its robustness and adaptability.

*Omid Orang,Patricia O. Lucas,Gabriel I. F. Paiva,Petronio C. L. Silva,Felipe Augusto Rocha da Silva,Adriano Alonso Veloso,Frederico Gadelha Guimaraes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CGF-LLM, a novel framework that combines GPT-2 with fuzzy time series and causal graphs for multivariate time series forecasting, converting numerical data into interpretable text representations for improved LLM-based prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have gained attention for time series forecasting, but existing approaches lack interpretability and structural understanding. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating a more interpretable framework that combines semantic understanding with structural insights for better time series prediction.

Method: The proposed CGF-LLM framework uses GPT-2 as the base model and applies parallel fuzzification and causal analysis to convert numerical time series data into interpretable textual representations. This involves fuzzy time series (FTS) techniques for semantic understanding and causal graph analysis for structural insights, which are then fed into the pretrained GPT-2 model.

Result: The CGF-LLM model demonstrated effectiveness across four different multivariate time series datasets, showing that the proposed approach successfully converts complex time series dynamics into interpretable forms while maintaining forecasting performance.

Conclusion: This work represents the first architecture combining GPT-2, fuzzy time series, and causal graphs for multivariate time series forecasting. The framework successfully creates interpretable textual representations of time series data and opens promising future directions for LLM-based time series forecasting using fuzzy time series approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time
series forecasting (TSF) has garnered significant attention among researchers.
This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with
fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series,
marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to
convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel
application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic
understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model.
The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the
complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results
confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting
model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets.
This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using
LLMs based on FTS.

### [162] [BiLO: Bilevel Local Operator Learning for PDE Inverse Problems. Part II: Efficient Uncertainty Quantification with Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17019)
*Ray Zirui Zhang,Christopher E. Miles,Xiaohui Xie,John S. Lowengrub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) to Bayesian inference for PDE-constrained optimization, using a two-level approach where neural networks approximate local solution operators at the lower level while sampling PDE parameters from posterior distributions at the upper level through gradient-based MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by PDEs are crucial in scientific and engineering applications, but existing Bayesian neural network methods face challenges with high-dimensional weight sampling and require prior distributions on neural network solutions. There's a need for more efficient and accurate methods that can naturally propagate uncertainty through PDE constraints.

Method: The method uses a bilevel optimization framework: (1) Lower level - trains neural networks to approximate local solution operators by minimizing local operator loss, (2) Upper level - samples PDE parameters from posterior distributions using gradient-based MCMC methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). This approach enforces strong PDE constraints and bypasses sampling in high-dimensional neural network weight spaces.

Result: The method demonstrates accurate parameter inference and uncertainty quantification while maintaining high computational efficiency across various PDE models. The authors analyze both dynamic error in MCMC gradient sampling and static error in posterior distribution due to inexact lower-level minimization, establishing a direct relationship between lower-level tolerance and uncertainty quantification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed BiLO extension to Bayesian inference successfully improves accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty quantification by naturally propagating uncertainty through PDE constraints rather than requiring priors on neural network solutions. The method offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing Bayesian neural network approaches for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) are central to a wide range of scientific and
engineering applications. In this second part of a two part series, we extend
Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization
problems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower
level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by
minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural
network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior
distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with
existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the
challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights
and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network
solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the
PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method
improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty
quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC
sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact
minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between
the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the
resulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a
variety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate
inference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high
computational efficiency.

### [163] [Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17056)
*Anton Matsson,Yaochen Rao,Heather J. Litman,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an interpretable alternative to offline reinforcement learning for deriving treatment policies by using tree-based models to identify the most frequently chosen actions in patient states, addressing challenges in interpretability and evaluation in safety-critical healthcare domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL has potential for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but faces significant challenges in safety-critical domains: (1) interpretability issues due to black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, and (2) evaluation difficulties with off-policy methods that are sensitive to deviations from data-collecting behavior policies, especially when using importance sampling methods.

Method: The authors propose deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state using an interpretable tree-based model of the behavior policy. The tree structure naturally groups states with respect to treatment and ensures interpretability by design. The approach controls overlap with the behavior policy by varying the number of actions considered, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation.

Result: Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, the policies derived under this framework demonstrated superior performance compared to current practice. The approach successfully captures collective clinical judgment embedded in the data while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: This pragmatic approach to policy development offers an interpretable alternative to offline RL methods by standardizing frequent treatment patterns. It addresses key limitations of traditional offline RL in safety-critical domains while maintaining practical applicability and superior performance over current practice.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal
policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability
and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains.
Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL
policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to
large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when
using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from
the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an
interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which
is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural
grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures
interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered
controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable
off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development
standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical
judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid
arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this
framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives
to those obtained via offline RL.

### [164] [Risk In Context: Benchmarking Privacy Leakage of Foundation Models in Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17066)
*Jessup Byun,Xiaofeng Lin,Joshua Ward,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) for synthetic tabular data generation in low-data settings, revealing significant privacy risks where these models can leak sensitive information through membership inference attacks, and proposes prompt optimization strategies to improve the privacy-utility tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art generative models require large datasets and can overfit in low-data settings where synthetic data is most needed. While foundation models using in-context learning avoid retraining, they introduce new privacy risks by potentially repeating seed rows verbatim. The severity of this privacy risk in tabular data synthesis, where single rows may identify individuals, has not been systematically studied.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive benchmark comparing three foundation models against four baseline methods on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy domains. They evaluate models across three dimensions: statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage. Additionally, they perform a factorial study testing prompt optimization strategies including batch size adjustment, temperature tuning, and summary statistics usage.

Result: Foundation models consistently showed the highest privacy risk, with LLaMA 3.3 70B achieving up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at 1% false-positive rate compared to the safest baseline. CTGAN and GPT-4o-mini offered better privacy-utility tradeoffs. The proposed prompt tweaks (small batch size, low temperature, summary statistics) reduced worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up to 39 points while maintaining over 90% statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: Foundation models pose significant privacy risks for tabular data synthesis, but careful prompt engineering can substantially improve the privacy-utility tradeoff. The benchmark provides practical guidance for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models, highlighting the need for privacy-aware approaches when using these powerful but potentially risky tools for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows,
especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models
(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of
examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic
data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent
retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows
via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no
parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,
introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity
of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a
person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three
foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four
baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate
statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.
Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.
LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at
1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly
vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and
GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three
zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary
statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up
to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a
practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an ensemble-based defense architecture to protect Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models in autonomous driving from adversarial attacks, achieving significant improvements in robustness with over 213% increase in mean reward and 82% reduction in collision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While DRL has shown success across various domains including autonomous driving, there is a critical research gap regarding the robustness of DRL models against adversarial attacks, particularly the integration of multiple defense mechanisms in autonomous driving scenarios where safety is paramount.

Method: The authors propose a novel ensemble-based defense architecture that integrates multiple defense mechanisms to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving scenarios, building upon existing defenses like adversarial training and distillation.

Result: The ensemble method significantly outperforms baseline and standalone defense strategies under FGSM attacks: mean reward improved from 5.87 to 18.38 (213% increase) and mean collision rate reduced from 0.50 to 0.09 (82% decrease) in highway and merge scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble-based defense architecture effectively enhances the robustness of DRL models in autonomous driving against adversarial attacks, demonstrating superior performance compared to individual defense strategies and establishing a promising direction for securing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated
its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare,
energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question
remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While
existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation
enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap
regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios
specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based
defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances
the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our
ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213%
increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82%
decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all
standalone defense strategies.

### [166] [Sensor Drift Compensation in Electronic-Nose-Based Gas Recognition Using Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17071)
*Juntao Lin,Xianghao Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a novel method for compensating sensor drift in electronic nose systems, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods with up to 18% improvement in accuracy through rigorous statistical validation on the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic nose systems suffer from sensor drift due to environmental changes and sensor aging, which degrades gas classification performance in real-world deployment. Previous drift compensation studies lacked robust statistical validation and may have overcompensated, losing important class-related variance.

Method: The authors designed two domain adaptation tasks using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset and systematically tested three methods: a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, the benchmark Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid KD-DRCA method across 30 random test set partitions for statistical rigor.

Result: Knowledge Distillation consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA methods, achieving up to 18% improvement in accuracy and 15% improvement in F1-score. This represents the first successful application of KD for electronic nose drift mitigation.

Conclusion: The proposed Knowledge Distillation method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art DRCA method for sensor drift compensation, enhancing the reliability of electronic nose systems in real-world environments through superior drift compensation effectiveness.

Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the
performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world
deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset
reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical
experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing
class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift
compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation
tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to
predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and
predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous
training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three
methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark
method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method
KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed
that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%
improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior
effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for
electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift
compensation in real-world environments.

*Olivia Dry,Timothy L. Molloy,Wanxin Jin,Iman Shames*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ZORMS-LfD, a zeroth-order optimization method for learning optimal control problems from expert demonstrations that doesn't require gradient computation and works for both continuous and discrete time systems with constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing first-order methods for learning from demonstrations require gradient computation of costs, constraints, dynamics, and learning loss, which may not always be available or computationally feasible. Additionally, most methods focus on discrete time systems, leaving constrained continuous-time problems underexplored.

Method: ZORMS-LfD (Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations) uses gradient-free optimization to learn costs, constraints, and dynamics of constrained optimal control problems from expert demonstrations, working for both continuous and discrete time systems without requiring smoothness assumptions.

Result: ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods in learning loss and compute time across various benchmarks. For unconstrained continuous-time problems, it achieves similar performance with over 80% reduction in compute time. For constrained continuous-time problems, it outperforms gradient-free methods like Nelder-Mead.

Conclusion: ZORMS-LfD provides an effective gradient-free alternative for learning from demonstrations in optimal control, particularly excelling in continuous-time constrained problems where traditional first-order methods may struggle or specialized methods don't exist.

Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations
(ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of
constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to
be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the
learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order
methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs,
constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls
and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time,
with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention.
We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across
a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark
problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art
first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On
constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized
state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used
gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.

### [168] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tunes a Sparse Subnetwork in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17107)
*Andrii Balashov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discovers that reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models naturally creates sparse parameter updates, modifying only 5-30% of weights while leaving most parameters unchanged, and demonstrates that training only this sparse subnetwork can achieve equivalent performance to full model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors challenge the common assumption that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, investigating whether there might be more efficient approaches to aligning LLMs with human preferences through RL.

Method: The researchers analyze parameter update patterns across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (OpenAI, Meta, open-source LLMs), examining which weights change during RL fine-tuning and testing whether fine-tuning only the identified sparse subnetworks can maintain performance.

Result: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only 5-30% of model weights across different algorithms and models, with substantial overlap in updated subnetworks across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms. Fine-tuning only the sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and produces parameters nearly identical to fully fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: RL adapts models by focusing on a small, consistently updated subnetwork rather than shifting all weights, which occurs because RL operates near the model's original distribution requiring only targeted changes. This finding enables more efficient RL methods and connects sparsity to the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large
language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods
and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARIA is an LLM agent framework that continuously learns and adapts to changing domain knowledge during operation through self-assessment, human interaction, and systematic knowledge repository updates, showing significant improvements in dynamic environments like regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle in environments with frequently changing rules and domain knowledge (like regulatory compliance and risk screening) because offline fine-tuning and standard prompting cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation.

Method: ARIA uses structured self-dialogue to assess uncertainty and identify knowledge gaps, proactively requests targeted explanations from human experts, maintains a timestamped internal knowledge repository, and resolves conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries.

Result: ARIA demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents on customer due diligence name screening tasks and dynamic knowledge tasks. Successfully deployed in TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users.

Conclusion: ARIA effectively addresses the challenge of continuous learning in dynamic environments by combining self-assessment, human-AI interaction, and systematic knowledge management, proving its practical value in real-world applications with rapidly evolving requirements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules
and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance
and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and
standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to
new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose
the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework
designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test
time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,
proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or
corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,
timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and
resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and
clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence
name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic
knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability
and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and
existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over
150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness
for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

*Ting Jiang,Yixiao Wang,Hancheng Ye,Zishan Shao,Jingwei Sun,Jingyang Zhang,Zekai Chen,Jianyi Zhang,Yiran Chen,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SADA (Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration), a novel method that accelerates diffusion model sampling by adaptively applying sparsity decisions based on sampling trajectory stability, achieving 1.8x+ speedups with minimal quality loss across multiple models and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models suffer from high computational costs due to iterative sampling and quadratic attention costs. Current training-free acceleration methods reduce computation but show low faithfulness because they don't consider varying denoising trajectories for different prompts and ignore the underlying ODE formulation's numerical solution requirements.

Method: SADA unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions using a single stability criterion for ODE-based generative models. It adaptively allocates sparsity based on sampling trajectory and introduces principled approximation schemes that leverage precise gradient information from numerical ODE solvers to maintain fidelity while accelerating inference.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux with EDM and DPM++ solvers show consistent ≥1.8x speedups with minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS ≤0.10, FID ≤4.5). SADA outperforms prior methods and adapts seamlessly to other pipelines like ControlNet and MusicLDM (1.8x speedup with ~0.01 spectrogram LPIPS).

Conclusion: SADA successfully addresses the fidelity-speed trade-off in diffusion model acceleration by considering prompt-specific denoising trajectories and ODE numerical solutions. The method demonstrates superior performance across multiple models and modalities while maintaining seamless integration with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Anant Khandelwal,Mucong Ding,Radu Balan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PICore is an unsupervised coreset selection framework that reduces training data requirements for neural operators solving PDEs by selecting the most informative samples using physics-informed loss, achieving up to 78% improvement in training efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators for solving PDEs face two major bottlenecks: they require large amounts of training data and expensive labeled data generated through numerical simulations. Current methods need both extensive data and costly ground-truth solutions, making training inefficient and expensive.

Method: PICore uses an unsupervised coreset selection framework that leverages physics-informed loss to identify the most informative unlabeled training samples based on their potential contribution to operator learning. Only the selected compact subset of inputs is then simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels, reducing both annotation costs and training time.

Result: Across four diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency compared to supervised coreset selection methods while maintaining minimal changes in accuracy. The method significantly reduces both data labeling costs and training time.

Conclusion: PICore successfully addresses the dual challenges of data efficiency and labeling costs in neural operator training by using physics-informed unsupervised coreset selection. This approach enables more practical and cost-effective training of neural operators for PDE solving while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We

*Vinura Galwaduge,Jagath Samarabandu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that provides actionable explanations to help understand and counter cyberattacks, demonstrating superior performance in generating minimal, diverse explanations compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern NIDS rely on complex deep learning models that act as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand detection decisions, build trust, and implement timely countermeasures against attacks. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods don't provide explanations that can be easily converted into actionable countermeasures for network security.

Method: The authors developed a diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework specifically designed for network intrusion detection. The method generates counterfactual explanations that can be summarized into global rules, providing actionable insights at both instance and global levels for intrusion attacks.

Result: The proposed algorithm was evaluated against several publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3 modern network intrusion datasets. It demonstrated superior performance by providing minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations in a more efficient manner with reduced explanation generation time. The method also successfully created global counterfactual rules that can effectively filter out incoming attack queries.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework successfully addresses the opacity problem in NIDS by providing actionable explanations that can be converted into practical countermeasures. The global rules derived from counterfactual explanations prove effective for filtering attack queries, making this approach crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the
predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box"
nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders
the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and
prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)
methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the
causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide
explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable
countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based
counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations
for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against
several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3
modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also
presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation
algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our
proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the
tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by
reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how
counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing
them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at
instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global
counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack
queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense
mechanisms.

*Shaohan Li,Hao Yang,Min Chen,Xiaolin Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Met2Net, an implicit two-stage training method for weather prediction that uses separate encoders/decoders for each weather variable and a translator to capture inter-variable interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 28.82% and 23.39% MSE reduction for temperature and humidity predictions respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end deep learning methods for weather prediction face limitations of representation inconsistency in multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture dependencies between variables in complex weather systems. Existing two-stage approaches from multimodal models are suboptimal due to inconformity in training tasks between stages.

Method: The paper proposes an implicit two-stage training method with separate encoders and decoders for each weather variable. Stage 1: Translator is frozen while Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space. Stage 2: Encoders and Decoders are frozen while the Translator captures inter-variable interactions for prediction. A self-attention mechanism is introduced for multivariable fusion in the latent space.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in weather prediction, specifically reducing MSE by 28.82% for near-surface air temperature predictions and 23.39% for relative humidity predictions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed implicit two-stage training approach with separate variable-specific encoders/decoders and a translator effectively addresses representation inconsistency and inter-variable dependency issues in weather prediction, demonstrating significant performance improvements over current methods.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate
change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been
made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques,
but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in
multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency
between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating
different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage
training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue,
but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the
results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an
implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders
for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen
while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second
stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures
inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a
self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the
performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments
show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces
the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by
28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to transform generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into efficient video content moderation classifiers using a router-ranking cascade system, achieving 66.50% F1 score improvement while reducing computational costs to 1.5% of direct deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video classification models struggle with complex content moderation scenarios like implicit harmful content and contextual ambiguity. While MLLMs offer superior cross-modal reasoning, their high computational cost and the challenge of adapting generative models for discriminative classification hinder industrial adoption.

Method: The authors propose two key components: (1) an efficient method to transform generative MLLMs into multimodal classifiers using minimal discriminative training data, and (2) a router-ranking cascade system that integrates MLLMs with lightweight router models for scalable deployment.

Result: Offline experiments show 66.50% F1 score improvement over traditional classifiers with only 2% of the fine-tuning data required. Online evaluations demonstrate 41% increase in automatic content moderation volume, while the cascade system reduces computational cost to just 1.5% of direct full-scale deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the computational and adaptation challenges of MLLMs for video content moderation, enabling practical industrial deployment while maintaining superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard
user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video
classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they
struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and
contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a
promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal
reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder
their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes
full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for
discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,
we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a
multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable
industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that
integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over
traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online
evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume
by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5%
of direct full-scale deployment.

*Youneng Bao,Yiping Liu,Zhuo Chen,Yongsheng Liang,Mu Li,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset distillation that achieves up to 170× greater compression than standard methods while maintaining comparable accuracy by parameterizing synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes and trading off storage efficiency with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on either maximizing performance under fixed storage budgets or finding suitable synthetic data representations for redundancy removal, but fail to jointly optimize both storage efficiency and performance objectives in the era of increasingly large datasets and models.

Method: The authors parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes decoded by extremely lightweight networks, estimate Shannon entropy of quantized latents as the rate measure, use existing distillation loss as utility measure, and trade them off via Lagrange multiplier optimization. They also introduce bits per class (bpc) as a precise storage metric.

Result: The method achieves up to 170× greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128 datasets. It consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs across diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed joint rate-utility optimization approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing dataset distillation methods by simultaneously optimizing storage efficiency and performance, demonstrating significant compression improvements while maintaining competitive accuracy across multiple datasets and experimental settings.

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Xiaochang Li,Huajie Shao,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P3SL is a personalized privacy-preserving split learning framework that allows heterogeneous edge devices to customize their privacy protection and model training while optimizing split points locally without sharing sensitive information with servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split learning frameworks for heterogeneous environments fail to address personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions, while neglecting the need for devices to maintain privacy about their computational resources and environmental constraints.

Method: The paper proposes P3SL with two key components: (1) a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that enables customized privacy protection and personalized local models, and (2) a bi-level optimization technique that allows clients to determine optimal split points locally without sharing sensitive information with the server.

Result: P3SL was implemented and evaluated on a testbed of 7 devices (4 Jetson Nano P3450, 2 Raspberry Pis, 1 laptop) using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions, demonstrating the framework's ability to balance energy consumption, privacy leakage risks, and model accuracy.

Conclusion: P3SL successfully addresses the limitations of existing heterogeneous split learning by providing personalized privacy protection and enabling local optimization of split points without compromising sensitive device information, making it suitable for resource-constrained edge environments with varying privacy requirements.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning
technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in
model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side
sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it
encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices
vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental
conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored
heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying
resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and
local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split
Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device
systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a
personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to
achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models
tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and
privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers
clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without
sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,
environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach
balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high
model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7
devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,
using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental
conditions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning that reduces environmental impact by optimizing data selection and federated node choice, demonstrating promising results in time series classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of AI/ML has significant environmental impact through energy consumption and carbon emissions. While Federated Learning offers advantages like reduced data transmission and enhanced privacy, it introduces challenges related to data heterogeneity and environmental impact that need to be addressed.

Method: The methodology involves: (1) analyzing characteristics of federated datasets, (2) selecting optimal data subsets based on quality metrics, (3) choosing federated nodes with lowest environmental impact, and (4) developing an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction to minimize environmental impact during training.

Result: The methodology was applied to time series classification and demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of Federated Learning tasks through data-centric optimization approaches.

Conclusion: The paper successfully contributes to Green AI by providing a comprehensive data-centric methodology that can minimize the environmental footprint of Federated Learning while maintaining training performance, offering a practical solution for sustainable ML deployment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the
environmental impact of FL tasks.

*Haolin Jin,Mengbai Xiao,Yuan Yuan,Xiao Zhang,Dongxiao Yu,Guanghui Zhang,Haoliang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistrAttention is a novel self-attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity from quadratic to more efficient by grouping data on embedding dimensions using locality-sensitive hashing, achieving 37% speedup over FlashAttention-2 while maintaining full contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core self-attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which limits scalability. Existing optimization approaches either lose full-contextual information or lack flexibility, creating a need for an efficient yet comprehensive solution.

Method: DistrAttention groups data on embedding dimensionality using locality-sensitive hashing to identify similar data points. It employs a lightweight sampling and fusion method with a block-wise grouping framework to minimize errors from the hashing process. The method is optimized for integration with FlashAttention-2 through careful block size selection.

Result: DistrAttention achieves 37% faster computation than FlashAttention-2 for self-attention calculations. In ViT inference, it demonstrates the fastest speed and highest accuracy among approximate self-attention mechanisms. For Llama3-1B, it achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: DistrAttention successfully addresses the scalability limitations of Transformer self-attention by providing an efficient mechanism that maintains full contextual information while achieving significant speedups across different model architectures and tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the
state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,
self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence
length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches
on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack
of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and
flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention
achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually
referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and
fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A
block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors
introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block
sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining
high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive
experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than
FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,
DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate
self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the
lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

*Songxuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how Autoencoders can be made generative by connecting VAEs and VQ-VAEs through a new training framework that uses clustering centers instead of KL divergence, revealing insights about encoding space structure in generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Autoencoders have limited generative capabilities due to undefined regions in their encoding space. The authors aim to bridge the gap between VAEs and VQ-VAEs while addressing the compactness issues in latent representations without relying on traditional regularization techniques.

Method: The authors propose a VAE-like training method that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness in latent space, avoiding traditional KL divergence and reparameterization techniques. They extend this approach to multiple learnable vectors and analyze the progression toward VQ-VAE-like models in continuous space.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, CelebA, and FashionMNIST show smooth interpolative transitions, though with persistent blurriness. The method naturally progresses toward VQ-VAE-like behavior when extended to multiple vectors, but degenerates into a discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE) that combines image fragments without semantic learning when the encoder outputs multiple vectors.

Conclusion: The study reveals the critical importance of encoding space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling, establishes intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, and provides new perspectives on their design principles and inherent limitations in generative tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the generative capabilities of Autoencoders (AEs) and
establishes connections between Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Vector
Quantized-Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) through a reformulated training
framework. We demonstrate that AEs exhibit generative potential via latent
space interpolation and perturbation, albeit limited by undefined regions in
the encoding space. To address this, we propose a new VAE-like training method
that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness and ensure
well-defined latent spaces without relying on traditional KL divergence or
reparameterization techniques. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA, and
FashionMNIST datasets show smooth interpolative transitions, though blurriness
persists. Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a
natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However,
when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a
discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning
semantic representations. Our findings highlight the critical role of encoding
space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling and provide insights
into the intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, offering a new
perspective on their design and limitations.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that combines Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to automatically analyze complex warehouse simulation data, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies through iterative reasoning and self-correction, achieving near-perfect performance in operational analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations (DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a critical yet challenging task that often demands significant manual effort or specialized analytical tools, creating a need for automated intelligent analysis solutions.

*Aritz Pérez,Carlos Echegoyen,Guzmán Santafé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decentralized federated learning approach for training probabilistic generative classifiers where nodes share local statistics with neighbors and iteratively update local models that converge to a global model without requiring a central server.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable federated learning in decentralized architectures where users can collaborate directly without relying on a central server, while maintaining privacy by not sharing raw data and handling heterogeneous user environments with non-i.i.d. data distributions.

Method: The method involves a communication network of local nodes where each node shares local statistics (not raw data) with neighboring nodes, aggregates neighbors' information, and uses a local updating rule to iteratively learn its own classifier that progressively converges to a global model.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally competitive model across various conditions including different network topologies, network sizes, local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized federated learning framework successfully enables collaborative learning of probabilistic generative classifiers without central coordination, demonstrating robust convergence performance across diverse network conditions and data distributions.

Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of increasing relevance in real world
applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of
heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on
model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate
directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In
this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively
learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The
framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes,
each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal
involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node
aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local
classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally
competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes,
local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

### [185] [R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307)
*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch is a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by intelligently switching between small and large language models during inference, achieving up to 85% latency reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning enhances LLM problem-solving but introduces substantial computational overhead due to autoregressive decoding over long sequences. Existing acceleration methods have limitations: early stopping reduces quality, and speculative decoding suffers from low agreement between models and fails to exploit small models' advantages in concise reasoning.

Method: R-Stitch employs a confidence-based hybrid decoding approach that uses a small language model (SLM) by default and switches to a large language model (LLM) only when the SLM's confidence drops below a threshold. This avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM only on uncertain reasoning steps. The framework is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.

Result: Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks show R-Stitch achieves up to 85% reduction in inference latency while maintaining negligible accuracy drop, demonstrating significant speedup without compromising reasoning quality.

Conclusion: R-Stitch provides an effective solution for accelerating CoT reasoning by strategically combining small and large models based on confidence levels, offering substantial computational savings while preserving answer quality, making it practically viable for efficient reasoning applications.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

### [186] [Confounded Causal Imitation Learning with Instrumental Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17309)
*Yan Zeng,Shenglan Nie,Feng Xie,Libo Huang,Peng Wu,Zhi Geng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes C2L (Confounded Causal Imitation Learning), a two-stage framework that uses instrumental variables to address unmeasured confounders in imitation learning, enabling better policy estimation from biased demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imitation learning suffers from confounding effects of unmeasured variables that influence states and actions, leading to biased policy estimation. Existing methods cannot handle confounders that affect actions across multiple timesteps beyond immediate temporal dependencies.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) First stage develops a testing criterion based on pseudo-variables to identify valid instrumental variables (IV) with sufficient and necessary identifiability conditions; (2) Second stage uses the identified IV for policy optimization through either simulator-based or offline learning approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of both the valid IV identification process and the subsequent policy learning performance, validating the approach's ability to handle multi-timestep confounding effects.

Conclusion: The C2L model successfully leverages instrumental variables to break the confounding gap in imitation learning, providing a principled approach to learn unbiased policies from confounded demonstrations while accommodating complex temporal confounding patterns.

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding
effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states
and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be
entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of
the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal
Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that
influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to
immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning
framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular,
in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined
pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L
models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability
conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we
propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,
while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of
identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

*Rui Wu,Nikola Kovachki,Burigede Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) that uses pre-trained neural operators to efficiently solve PDEs on complex geometries, demonstrating superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods like Finite Element Method struggle with computational cost and scalability for large, geometrically complex problems, while existing neural network approaches are limited to simple domains and cannot handle real-world PDEs with complex geometries.

Method: The authors develop a learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) that employs a single pre-trained neural operator (originally trained on simple domains) as a surrogate model within a domain decomposition framework, enabling efficient handling of large and complicated domains.

Result: The method successfully approximates solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous microstructures in complex geometries using physics-pretrained neural operators (PPNO), outperforming state-of-the-art methods while providing resolution-invariance and strong generalization to unseen microstructural patterns.

Conclusion: L-DDM bridges the gap between neural network efficiency and complex domain applicability, offering a scalable solution for real-world PDE problems with complex geometries while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical performance advantages.

Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have
driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at
much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical
methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle
with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and
geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods
have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate
nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely
limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs
involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain
decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a
single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a
surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle
large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical
result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of
domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method
by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous
microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural
operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers
resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns
unseen during training.

*Xianbiao Qi,Marco Chen,Wenjie Xiao,Jiaquan Ye,Yelin He,Chun-Guang Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT) that strategically places normalization techniques to enable effective training with vanilla momentum SGD instead of requiring adaptive optimizers like AdamW, while maintaining comparable performance to standard Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers require advanced adaptive optimizers like AdamW for training due to heavy-tailed gradient distributions, making them incompatible with simpler momentum SGD optimizers. This limitation restricts optimization flexibility and potentially increases computational overhead.

Method: The authors strategically integrate normalization techniques at specific positions within Transformer architectures to modulate Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights and activations, and concentrate gradient distributions, enabling training with vanilla momentum SGDW.

Result: DNT outperforms standard Transformer counterparts (ViT and GPT) and can be effectively trained using vanilla momentum SGDW optimizer, achieving comparable performance to Transformers trained with AdamW while using a simpler optimization approach.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that careful placement of normalization techniques in Transformer architectures can resolve the gradient distribution issues that previously necessitated adaptive optimizers, enabling successful training with simpler momentum-based methods without performance degradation.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

*Rongwei Lu,Jingyan Jiang,Chunyang Li,Haotian Dong,Xingguang Wei,Delin Cai,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DeCo-SGD, a distributed machine learning optimizer that dynamically adjusts gradient compression and staleness based on real-time network conditions to overcome throughput degradation in high-latency, low-bandwidth networks, achieving up to 5.07x speedup over standard distributed SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed machine learning suffers severe throughput degradation in challenging network environments with high latency and low, varying bandwidth. While distributed SGD remains mainstream due to low communication requirements, it still experiences significant performance reduction. Existing approaches use gradient compression and delayed aggregation but rely on static heuristic strategies without theoretical guidance, failing to optimally balance the three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness, and model convergence rate under varying network conditions.

Method: The authors introduce a new theoretical framework that decomposes the joint optimization problem into traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable noise terms. They develop DeCo-SGD, which integrates convergence rate analysis with network-aware time minimization conditions to dynamically adjust compression ratio and staleness parameters based on real-time network conditions and training task requirements.

Result: DeCo-SGD achieves significant performance improvements: up to 5.07x speedup over distributed SGD and 1.37x speedup over static strategies in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks. The theoretical analysis reveals that staleness exponentially amplifies the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, providing critical insights into how compressed and delayed gradients affect training.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the theoretical gap in understanding the interaction between gradient compression and delayed aggregation in distributed machine learning. DeCo-SGD's dynamic adaptation strategy effectively balances the trade-offs in challenging network environments, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing approaches and providing the first theoretical foundation for adaptive parameter adjustment in distributed training.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying
bandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to
its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the
mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from
significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing
approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to
alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both
challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a
complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed
synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance
under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to
dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on
static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which
prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical
gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization
problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable
noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies
the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a
critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect
training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware
time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the
compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and
training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and
static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,
respectively.

Motivation: The ordinal classification field lacks a comprehensive set of standardized datasets for benchmarking novel approaches, hindering robust validation and comparison of new methodologies in this important area of machine learning.

Method: Creation of TOC-UCO repository containing 46 tabular ordinal datasets preprocessed under a common framework, with ensured reasonable pattern numbers and appropriate class distributions, plus 30 randomized train-test partitions for reproducible experiments.

Result: A publicly available repository (TOC-UCO) with 46 preprocessed tabular ordinal datasets, complete with sources, preprocessing steps, and standardized evaluation protocols including predefined train-test splits for reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: TOC-UCO provides the ordinal classification community with a much-needed standardized benchmarking resource, enabling robust validation and fair comparison of novel approaches while facilitating reproducible research in the field.

Abstract: An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of
classification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship
among the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world
applications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal
methodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that
the development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of
a comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature
have to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript
from the University of C\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the
OC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of
tabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO
(Tabular Ordinal Classification repository of the UCO). Specifically, this
repository includes a set of $46$ tabular ordinal datasets, preprocessed under
a common framework and ensured to have a reasonable number of patterns and an
appropriate class distribution. We also provide the sources and preprocessing
steps of each dataset, along with details on how to benchmark a novel approach

Conclusion: DynaSearcher successfully addresses key challenges in multi-step retrieval systems by leveraging structured knowledge and multi-objective optimization, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve competitive performance with proper architectural design and training strategies.

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks.
However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical
applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate
queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning
deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose
DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs
and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system
leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search
process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual
consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for
fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy,
efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of
high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while
discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or
redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets,
matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited
computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and

*Hao Dai,Chong Tang,Jagmohan Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ViRN is a continual learning framework that combines variational inference with distributional trilateration to handle long-tailed data distributions, achieving 10.24% accuracy improvement over existing methods by modeling class-conditional distributions and reconstructing tail-class representations through geometric fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI systems face the challenge of continual learning with long-tailed data distributions where models must sequentially adapt to new classes while retaining old knowledge despite severe class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity, often failing under extreme sample scarcity conditions.

Method: The paper proposes ViRN, which integrates two key components: (1) A Variational Autoencoder to model class-conditional distributions and mitigate bias toward head classes, and (2) Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval with geometric fusion to reconstruct tail-class distributions for sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations.

Result: ViRN was evaluated on six long-tailed classification benchmarks including speech tasks (rare acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 10.24% over state-of-the-art continual learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ViRN framework successfully addresses the critical challenge of continual learning with long-tailed distributions by effectively combining variational inference and distributional trilateration, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks and establishing a robust approach for real-world AI applications.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with long-tailed data distributions remains a
critical challenge for real-world AI systems, where models must sequentially
adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of old ones, despite severe
class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity,
often collapsing under extreme sample scarcity. To address this, we propose
ViRN, a novel CL framework that integrates variational inference (VI) with
distributional trilateration for robust long-tailed learning. First, we model
class-conditional distributions via a Variational Autoencoder to mitigate bias
toward head classes. Second, we reconstruct tail-class distributions via
Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval and geometric fusion,
enabling sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations. Evaluated on
six long-tailed classification benchmarks, including speech (e.g., rare
acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, ViRN achieves a 10.24% average
accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

### [194] [Rubrics as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17746)
*Anisha Gunjal,Anthony Wang,Elaine Lau,Vaskar Nath,Bing Liu,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Rubrics as Rewards" (RaR), a framework that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for reinforcement learning training of language models, achieving up to 28% improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to traditional preference-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks often lack clear ground truth for defining reliable reward signals in RLVR, while traditional preference-based methods use opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious correlations. There's a need for more interpretable and reliable reward signals for post-training language models.

Method: The paper proposes Rubrics as Rewards (RaR), a framework that employs structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). This approach treats rubrics as structured reward signals to enable better alignment with human preferences.

Result: The best RaR method achieves up to 28% relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based approaches, while matching or surpassing performance of reward signals derived from expert-written references. The method enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and maintains robust performance across different model scales.

Conclusion: RaR successfully addresses the interpretability and reliability issues of traditional preference-based reward methods by using structured rubrics as reward signals. The framework demonstrates superior performance and enables better human preference alignment while maintaining robustness across model scales, offering a promising solution for RLVR in real-world applications.

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

*Hao Dai,Jagmohan Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes VB-CGCD, a variational Bayesian framework for Continual Generalized Category Discovery that addresses catastrophic forgetting by analyzing covariance misalignment between old and new classes, achieving +15.21% improvement over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Continual Generalized Category Discovery methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting when incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving knowledge of old classes, particularly when unlabeled data contains both known and novel categories.

Method: The paper proposes Variational Bayes C-GCD (VB-CGCD), which integrates variational inference with covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. The method uses Bayesian analysis to understand forgetting dynamics, identifies covariance misalignment as the key issue, and employs stochastic variational updates to adaptively align class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise.

Result: VB-CGCD achieves +15.21% improvement in overall accuracy compared to prior art on standard benchmarks. On a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data, VB-CGCD achieves 67.86% final accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (38.55%).

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in C-GCD by identifying and solving covariance misalignment through variational Bayesian methods, demonstrating robust performance across diverse scenarios and establishing a new state-of-the-art for continual generalized category discovery.

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD

### [196] [A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417)
*Yutong Liu,Cairong Zhao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review and fair comparison of post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for large language models, decoupling existing methods into pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation components, and evaluating the latest MXFP4 data format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of model quantization lacks fair comparisons since different methods contain multiple components and are not evaluated on the same ground. Additionally, there is a need to understand theoretical connections among existing quantization methods for better insight into the field.

Method: The authors conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art quantization methods and perform comprehensive evaluations on the same experimental ground. They decouple quantization methods into two steps: (1) pre-quantization transformation (preprocessing to reduce outlier impact and flatten data distribution) and (2) quantization error mitigation (techniques to offset quantization errors). They also evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format.

Result: Optimized rotation and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation. Combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone for quantization error mitigation. The optimal pre-quantization transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4 format.

Conclusion: The study provides a fair comparison framework for quantization methods and reveals that different quantization formats (INT4 vs MXFP4) may require different optimization strategies. The decoupling approach helps understand the theoretical connections between methods and identifies the most effective component combinations.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can
significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model
quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have
reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same
ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In
addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is
crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an
extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive
evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,
this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet
underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple
the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization
transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a
preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of
outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for
quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the
errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We
evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization
methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and
its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation
and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and
combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ
alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential
of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization
transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring
further investigation.

*Arsha Niksa,Hooman Zare,Ali Shahrabi,Hanieh Hatami,Mohammadreza Razvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel topological approach for emotion recognition using eye-tracking data, applying persistent homology to analyze gaze trajectories and achieving 75.6% accuracy in classifying four emotion categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional emotion recognition methods may not fully capture the complex temporal dynamics of gaze patterns. The authors aim to leverage topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology, to better understand and classify emotions from eye-tracking data by analyzing the geometric structure of gaze trajectories.

Method: The pipeline uses delay embeddings to transform gaze trajectories into higher-dimensional spaces, applies persistent homology to analyze topological features, extracts shape-based features (mean persistence, maximum persistence, and entropy) from persistence diagrams, and trains a random forest classifier on these topological features.

Result: The approach achieved up to 75.6% accuracy in classifying four emotion classes corresponding to the quadrants of the Circumplex Model of Affect. The persistence diagram geometry successfully encoded discriminative information about gaze dynamics across different emotional states.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that topological features from persistent homology can effectively capture emotion-relevant patterns in eye-tracking data, suggesting that this topological approach is promising for affective computing and human behavior analysis applications.

Abstract: We present a topological pipeline for automated multiclass emotion
recognition from eye-tracking data. Delay embeddings of gaze trajectories are
analyzed using persistent homology. From the resulting persistence diagrams, we
extract shape-based features such as mean persistence, maximum persistence, and
entropy. A random forest classifier trained on these features achieves up to
$75.6\%$ accuracy on four emotion classes, which are the quadrants the
Circumplex Model of Affect. The results demonstrate that persistence diagram
geometry effectively encodes discriminative gaze dynamics, suggesting a
promising topological approach for affective computing and human behavior
analysis.

### [198] [Efficient Neural Network Verification via Order Leading Exploration of Branch-and-Bound Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17453)
*Guanqin Zhang,Kota Fukuda,Zhenya Zhang,H. M. N. Dilum Bandara,Shiping Chen,Jianjun Zhao,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Oliva, a novel neural network verification framework that improves the efficiency of branch-and-bound (BaB) methods by intelligently prioritizing sub-problems that are more likely to contain counterexamples, achieving up to 25X speedup on MNIST and 80X on CIFAR10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing branch-and-bound verification methods explore sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, leading to inefficiency in reaching verification conclusions. There's a need to intelligently prioritize which sub-problems to explore first to accelerate the verification process.

Method: The paper introduces an ordering system over sub-problems based on their likelihood of containing counterexamples. Two variants are proposed: Oliva^GR (greedy strategy that always prioritizes high-likelihood sub-problems) and Oliva^SA (balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation).

Result: Experimental evaluation on 690 verification problems across 5 models with MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets shows significant speedups: up to 25X improvement on MNIST and up to 80X improvement on CIFAR10 compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Oliva framework successfully addresses the inefficiency issue in neural network verification by intelligently ordering sub-problem exploration, demonstrating substantial performance improvements while maintaining the same verification guarantees as existing methods.

Abstract: The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the
quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is
a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to
sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the
sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these
sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from
an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this
gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,
concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.
Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that
explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more
likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of
the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it
only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead
to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including
$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that
are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy
inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to
exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally
evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5
models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up
to 80X in CIFAR10.

### [199] [C3RL: Rethinking the Combination of Channel-independence and Channel-mixing from Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17454)
*Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C3RL is a novel representation learning framework for multivariate time series forecasting that combines channel-mixing (CM) and channel-independence (CI) strategies using contrastive learning, achieving significant performance improvements across different model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multivariate time series forecasting approaches face a trade-off: channel-mixing (CM) strategies capture inter-variable dependencies but miss variable-specific patterns, while channel-independence (CI) strategies capture variable-specific patterns but fail to exploit cross-variable dependencies. Hybrid feature fusion approaches have limited generalization and interpretability.

Method: C3RL uses a siamese network architecture inspired by contrastive learning from computer vision. It treats CM and CI strategy inputs as transposed views, with one strategy as the backbone and the other as complement. The framework jointly optimizes contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting to balance representation learning and forecasting performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven models demonstrate that C3RL significantly improves performance: boosting best-case performance rate to 81.4% for CI-based models and 76.3% for CM-based models, showing strong generalization across different model architectures.

Conclusion: C3RL successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by effectively combining CM and CI strategies through contrastive learning, providing a generalizable framework that enhances both representation learning and forecasting performance across various model types.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains like university admissions is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten fairness and long-term outcomes, despite relying on expertise and heuristics. There is a need for enhanced decision-making workflows that can mitigate these biases while maintaining interpretability.

Method: The authors propose BGM-HAN (Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network), which integrates hierarchical learning with various enhancements to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. The method captures multi-level representations through hierarchical attention mechanisms combined with byte-pair encoding and gated multi-head attention.

Result: Experimental results on real admissions data show that BGM-HAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines ranging from traditional machine learning methods to large language models. The model demonstrates improved both interpretability and predictive performance for nuanced assessment tasks.

Conclusion: BGM-HAN offers a promising framework for augmenting decision-making in high-stakes domains where structure, context, and fairness are critical considerations. The approach successfully addresses cognitive bias issues while maintaining superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains often relies on expertise and
heuristics, but is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten

*Nazar Buzun,Daniil Shlenskii,Maxim Bobrin,Dmitry V. Dylov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOTA introduces a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method for optimal transport that optimizes trajectories directly through Kantorovich potentials without requiring explicit density modeling, outperforming existing methods on both standard and non-differentiable cost benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models using optimal transport assume trivial geometry and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions, resulting in trajectories that don't respect true optimality principles in the underlying manifold. There's a need for methods that can handle complex geometries and non-smooth cost functionals without explicit density modeling.

Method: Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection (HOTA) uses a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based approach to tackle the dual dynamical optimal transport problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials. This enables efficient and scalable trajectory optimization while avoiding the need for explicit density modeling and handling non-smooth cost functionals.

Result: HOTA outperforms all baseline methods in standard benchmarks and custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, demonstrating superior performance in both feasibility and optimality metrics. The method effectively handles cases where cost functionals are non-smooth.

Conclusion: HOTA provides an effective solution for optimal transport in generative modeling by directly optimizing trajectories through Kantorovich potentials, eliminating density estimation requirements and successfully handling complex geometries and non-smooth cost functions with superior empirical performance.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the
probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial
geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,
yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in
the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection
(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical
OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and
scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for
explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are
non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,
as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of
feasibility and optimality.

### [202] [Generalized Low-Rank Matrix Contextual Bandits with Graph Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17528)
*Yao Wang,Jiannan Li,Yue Kang,Shanxing Gao,Zhenxin Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel matrix contextual bandit framework that integrates both low-rank structure and graph information using UCB algorithm with nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization, achieving better cumulative regret bounds than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matrix contextual bandit methods only utilize low-rank structure but fail to exploit additional graph information that naturally exists in real-world scenarios like online advertising and recommender systems, where user/item similarities can be captured through graph connectivity.

Method: The framework builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) and involves two key steps: (1) solving a joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem to incorporate both low-rank and graph structures, and (2) implementing a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB algorithm.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows the proposed method achieves better cumulative regret bounds compared to popular alternatives due to effective utilization of graph information. Synthetic and real-world experiments further demonstrate the superior performance of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed matrix contextual bandit framework successfully integrates low-rank structure and graph information in a unified manner, leading to improved decision-making policies with better theoretical guarantees and empirical performance in sequential decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: The matrix contextual bandit (CB), as an extension of the well-known
multi-armed bandit, is a powerful framework that has been widely applied in
sequential decision-making scenarios involving low-rank structure. In many
real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and recommender systems,
additional graph information often exists beyond the low-rank structure, that
is, the similar relationships among users/items can be naturally captured
through the connectivity among nodes in the corresponding graphs. However,
existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby
making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill
in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework
that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new
framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph
information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a
joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the
implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB
algorithm. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that our procedure
outperforms several popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound,
owing to the effective utilization of graph information. A series of synthetic
and real-world data experiments are conducted to further illustrate the merits
of our procedure.

### [203] [Generalized Advantage Estimation for Distributional Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17530)
*Shahil Shaik,Jonathon M. Smereka,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Distributional Generalized Advantage Estimation (DGAE), which extends traditional GAE to handle value distributions in distributional reinforcement learning using optimal transport theory and a Wasserstein-like directional metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GAE is not designed to handle value distributions that are integral to distributional RL, which can better capture system stochasticity and provide more robustness to system noises compared to single-value estimates.

Method: The authors utilize optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional metric that measures both distance and directional discrepancies between probability distributions. They then apply exponentially weighted estimation with this metric to derive distributional GAE (DGAE).

Result: DGAE was integrated into three different policy gradient methods and evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments, showing improved performance compared to baselines using traditional GAE.

Conclusion: DGAE successfully extends GAE to distributional RL while maintaining low-variance advantage estimates with controlled bias, making it suitable for policy gradient algorithms and demonstrating superior performance in experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the
computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an
exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the
variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not
designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can
capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to
system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional
metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies
between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,
we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional
GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a
low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for
policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy
updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.
Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared
with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.

*Aymeric Dieuleveut,Gersende Fort,Mahmoud Hegazy,Hoi-To Wai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for federated learning optimization based on Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, introducing SSMM algorithm and its federated extension QSMM that aggregates surrogate function information rather than parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning algorithms face challenges with data heterogeneity, partial participation, and communication constraints. There is a need for a unified approach that can robustly scale stochastic optimization algorithms to federated settings while addressing these common bottlenecks.

Method: The authors develop a framework based on Majorize-Minimization problems with linearly parameterized surrogate functions. They propose SSMM (Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM) as a unifying algorithm, then extend it to QSMM for federated settings. The key innovation is aggregating information about surrogate majorizing functions locally rather than aggregating original parameters.

Result: The framework encompasses various algorithms including proximal gradient methods, Expectation Maximization, and variational surrogate MM. SSMM generalizes previous stochastic MM procedures, and QSMM successfully addresses federated learning challenges. The methodology's flexibility is demonstrated through an application to federated optimal transport map computation.

Conclusion: The proposed MM-based framework provides a unified approach for federated optimization that effectively handles common federated learning bottlenecks. The novel approach of aggregating surrogate function information rather than parameters offers advantages over classical federated algorithms, with demonstrated applicability beyond the theoretical setting.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization
algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work
studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a
linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework
encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth
objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as
variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying
algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM),
which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then
extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common
bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and
communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to
learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the
\textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which
learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the
flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to
design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated
setting.

*Amandeep Singh Bhatia,Sabre Kais*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) algorithm that uses Fisher information to identify and preserve critical parameters during model aggregation, addressing challenges like communication costs and data heterogeneity in federated quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges including high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged processing times, and privacy vulnerabilities. While quantum federated learning shows promise, existing methods don't effectively handle parameter importance during aggregation. Fisher information can quantify information content in quantum states under parameter changes, providing insights into geometric and statistical properties that can be leveraged to improve federated quantum learning.

Method: The authors propose a QFL algorithm that computes Fisher information on local client models with heterogeneously distributed data. The method identifies critical parameters that significantly influence quantum model performance and ensures these important parameters are preserved during the federated aggregation process, rather than treating all parameters equally.

Result: Experimental evaluation on ADNI and MNIST datasets shows that the proposed Fisher information-based QFL approach achieves better performance and robustness compared to quantum federated averaging methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of incorporating Fisher information in quantum federated learning settings.

Conclusion: The Fisher information-based QFL algorithm successfully addresses key challenges in federated quantum learning by intelligently preserving critical parameters during aggregation. This approach outperforms existing quantum federated averaging methods, showing improved performance and robustness on standard datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-preserving collaborative quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different
sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model
without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication
between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several
challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged
processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent
years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits
has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for
fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of
quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance
model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that
Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state
carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric
and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the
aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on
local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.
This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence
the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the
aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of
QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the
benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental
results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum
federated averaging method.

TL;DR: XStacking is an explainable ensemble machine learning framework that combines stacking techniques with Shapley additive explanations to maintain predictive accuracy while providing interpretability, tested on 29 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble Machine Learning techniques like stacking improve predictive performance but suffer from lack of interpretability, creating a need for methods that can maintain accuracy while being explainable for responsible ML applications.

Method: XStacking framework integrates dynamic feature transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to create inherently explainable stacked models that combine multiple base models while preserving interpretability.

Result: The framework was validated on 29 datasets and demonstrated improvements in both predictive effectiveness of the learning space and interpretability of the resulting models, showing it can maintain stacking's predictive benefits while adding explainability.

Conclusion: XStacking provides a practical and scalable solution for responsible machine learning by successfully addressing the interpretability limitation of ensemble methods without sacrificing predictive performance, making it suitable for applications requiring both accuracy and explainability.

Abstract: Ensemble Machine Learning (EML) techniques, especially stacking, have been
shown to improve predictive performance by combining multiple base models.
However, they are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this
paper, we introduce XStacking, an effective and inherently explainable
framework that addresses this limitation by integrating dynamic feature
transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations. This enables
stacked models to retain their predictive accuracy while becoming inherently
explainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on 29 datasets,
achieving improvements in both the predictive effectiveness of the learning
space and the interpretability of the resulting models. XStacking offers a
practical and scalable solution for responsible ML.

*Alexander David Goldie,Zilin Wang,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Shimon Whiteson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper empirically compares different meta-learning approaches (evolution, LLMs) for automatically designing reinforcement learning algorithms, evaluating their performance, interpretability, and efficiency to provide guidelines for future meta-learned RL algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparison between different meta-learning algorithms for RL despite growing interest in automatically learning algorithms from data rather than manual design. Existing RL algorithms are often suboptimally adapted from supervised/unsupervised learning, making meta-learning particularly promising for RL.

Method: Empirical comparison of different meta-learning approaches including evolutionary optimization over black-box functions and large language models (LLMs) for code generation. The comparison evaluates meta-learned algorithms targeting different parts of the RL pipeline across multiple metrics including performance, interpretability, sample cost, and training time.

Result: The study provides comprehensive evaluation results comparing meta-learning approaches on meta-train and meta-test performance, along with analysis of interpretability, sample efficiency, and computational costs. The findings reveal trade-offs between different meta-learning methods for RL algorithm design.

Conclusion: Based on the empirical findings, the authors propose guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms to help ensure future learned algorithms achieve optimal performance. The work establishes a foundation for systematic comparison and development of meta-learned RL algorithms.

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on
manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the
performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise
for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from
supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.
However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different
meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box
functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical
comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned
algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to
meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the
interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.
Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL
algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as
performant as possible.

### [208] [Generalized Dual Discriminator GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17684)
*Penukonda Naga Chandana,Tejas Srivastava,Gowtham R. Kurri,V. Lalitha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces D2 α-GANs and generalized dual discriminator GANs that combine dual discriminators with tunable loss functions to address mode collapse, providing theoretical analysis showing the optimization reduces to minimizing linear combinations of f-divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the mode collapse problem in generative adversarial networks by building upon dual discriminator GANs (D2 GANs) and enhancing them with more flexible loss functions to improve training stability and generation quality.

Method: The method introduces dual discriminator α-GANs (D2 α-GANs) that combine dual discriminators with tunable α-loss functions, then generalizes this to arbitrary functions on positive reals, creating generalized dual discriminator GANs. Two discriminators are used - one rewarding high scores for real data and another favoring generator samples.

Result: The theoretical analysis shows that the min-max optimization of these models reduces to minimizing a linear combination of an f-divergence and reverse f-divergence, generalizing the known result for D2-GANs. Experiments on 2D synthetic data demonstrate the advantages using multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed generalized dual discriminator GANs successfully extend D2-GANs with flexible loss functions, providing theoretical guarantees that the optimization simplifies to divergence minimization, and experimental validation shows improved performance on synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced
to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In
D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one
discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution,
while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first
introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines
the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss
function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary
functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we
refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For
each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that
the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear
combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes
the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear
combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we
perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics
to capture various advantages of our GANs.

### [209] [Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687)
*Jiazhen Chen,Zheng Ma,Sichao Fu,Mingbin Feng,Tony S. Wirjanto,Weihua Ou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes OGCIL, a framework for open-set graph class-incremental learning that addresses catastrophic forgetting and unknown class detection in graph neural networks through pseudo-sample generation and prototypical hypersphere classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph class-incremental learning methods assume a closed-set scenario where all test samples belong to known classes, which is unrealistic since unknown classes naturally emerge in real-world applications. This limitation restricts their practical applicability and creates two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes and inadequate open-set recognition.

Method: The OGCIL framework uses: (1) A prototypical conditional variational autoencoder to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data; (2) A mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings; (3) A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss that anchors in-distribution embeddings to class prototypes while repelling OOD embeddings, modeling unknown samples as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that OGCIL outperforms existing graph class-incremental learning and open-set GNN methods, effectively addressing both catastrophic forgetting and unknown class detection in the open-set scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed OGCIL framework successfully tackles the challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning problem by combining pseudo-sample embedding generation with prototypical hypersphere classification, providing a robust solution for real-world graph analytical tasks where unknown classes emerge during inference.

Abstract: Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)
to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class
knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods
primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed
to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge
during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a
more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two
intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs
the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which
destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,
a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding
generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust
detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional
variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old
classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle
unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node
embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further
proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class
prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all
unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly
models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a
robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN
methods.

### [210] [Joint Asymmetric Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17692)
*Jialiang Wang,Xianming Liu,Xiong Zhou,Gangfeng Hu,Deming Zhai,Junjun Jiang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL), a novel robust loss framework that combines asymmetric losses with the Active Passive Loss optimization framework to better handle noisy labels in deep neural network training, overcoming limitations of existing symmetric and asymmetric loss approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetric losses for handling noisy labels suffer from underfitting due to overly strict constraints, while asymmetric losses show superior theoretical properties but are incompatible with advanced optimization frameworks like Active Passive Loss (APL), limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The authors extend asymmetric loss to the passive loss scenario by proposing Asymmetric Mean Square Error (AMSE) and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for it to satisfy asymmetric properties. They then substitute the traditional symmetric passive loss in APL with AMSE to create the Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JAL method effectively mitigates label noise and shows improved performance compared to existing approaches in learning with noisy labels.

Conclusion: The Joint Asymmetric Loss framework successfully combines the theoretical advantages of asymmetric losses with the practical benefits of the Active Passive Loss optimization approach, providing an effective solution for training deep neural networks with noisy labels.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

*Taha Ceritli,Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydraOpt is a new model merging technique for LLM adapters that reduces storage requirements by 48% while maintaining competitive performance, outperforming existing merging methods by leveraging similarities between low-rank adapter matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models use adapters for downstream tasks, but storing separate adapters for each task creates significant memory overhead, especially problematic for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices. Existing model merging techniques reduce storage but cause substantial performance drops.

Method: HydraOpt exploits inherent similarities between matrices of low-rank adapters to merge models more effectively. Unlike fixed trade-off methods, HydraOpt provides a navigable spectrum between storage efficiency and performance, allowing flexible optimization based on requirements.

Result: HydraOpt achieves 48% storage reduction compared to storing all adapters separately, with only 0.2-1.8% performance drop. It outperforms existing merging techniques in performance while maintaining similar or slightly worse storage efficiency.

Conclusion: HydraOpt successfully addresses the storage-performance trade-off challenge in LLM adapter deployment by providing a flexible merging approach that significantly reduces memory requirements while preserving competitive performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based
adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a
separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,
posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they
typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we
introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the
inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike
existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and
performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and
performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage
size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving
competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing
merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse
storage efficiency.

*Melih Barsbey,Antônio H. Ribeiro,Umut Şimşekli,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals a fundamental trade-off between neural network compression and adversarial robustness, showing that compressed models create exploitable vulnerabilities regardless of the compression method used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural networks need to be simultaneously accurate, generalizable, efficient, and robust to adversarial attacks, the relationship between compressibility and robustness remains poorly understood, despite both being extensively studied individually.

Method: The authors develop a principled theoretical framework to analyze how different compression forms (neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility) affect adversarial robustness, deriving robustness bounds that connect compression to representation sensitivity.

Result: The analysis shows that compression creates highly sensitive directions in representation space that adversaries can exploit, with vulnerabilities persisting across different compression methods, adversarial training, and transfer learning scenarios. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and realistic tasks confirm the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: There exists a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness in neural networks, suggesting the need for new approaches to design models that can achieve both efficiency and security simultaneously.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of flow matching techniques and their applications in biological domains, covering biological sequence modeling, molecule generation, and protein design, while also summarizing available datasets and tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative models like GANs, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models have transformed biological research, flow matching has emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion-based modeling. However, there was a lack of comprehensive review of flow matching applications in biology and life sciences, necessitating a systematic survey of this rapidly growing field.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic literature review and survey approach, organizing flow matching applications into three major biological categories: biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and protein generation. They also compile and categorize commonly used datasets and software tools in the field.

Result: The paper delivers a comprehensive categorization and review of flow matching foundations, variants, and applications across three key biological domains. It also provides curated resources including datasets and software tools, with all materials made available through a GitHub repository for the research community.

Conclusion: Flow matching represents a promising and efficient alternative to diffusion models for biological applications. The survey establishes a foundation for understanding current progress and identifies potential future research directions in applying flow matching to biology and life sciences.

Abstract: Over the past decade, advances in generative modeling, such as generative
adversarial networks, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models, have
significantly transformed biological research and discovery, enabling
breakthroughs in molecule design, protein generation, drug discovery, and
beyond. At the same time, biological applications have served as valuable
testbeds for evaluating the capabilities of generative models. Recently, flow
matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based
generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in
biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological
domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of
flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas:
biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and
protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress.

*Melih Barsbey,Lucas Prieto,Stefanos Zafeiriou,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that using large learning rates during training can simultaneously achieve robustness against spurious correlations and network compressibility, while also producing beneficial representation properties like invariant features and activation sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern machine learning models need to be both robust and resource-efficient, but achieving these two properties together is challenging. The authors investigate whether large learning rates can serve as a simple solution to address both requirements simultaneously.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate the effects of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, different model architectures, and various optimizers. They analyze representation properties including invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity to understand how large learning rates impact model behavior.

Result: Large learning rates consistently outperform other hyperparameters and regularization methods in achieving both robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. The method produces desirable representation properties and shows effectiveness across multiple datasets, models, and optimizers. The results suggest that previous success of large learning rates in standard classification may be due to addressing hidden spurious correlations.

Conclusion: Large learning rates serve as an effective facilitator for jointly achieving robustness and resource-efficiency in machine learning models. This simple hyperparameter adjustment can replace more complex regularization methods while providing consistent benefits across diverse settings, potentially explaining the broader success of large learning rates in machine learning.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform that uses intrinsic magnetic stochasticity in spintronic devices to efficiently implement probabilistic neural networks for uncertainty-aware AI, achieving seven orders of magnitude improvement over CMOS implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural networks lack uncertainty estimation capabilities, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) can provide uncertainty quantification, traditional CMOS architectures are designed for deterministic operation and suppress randomness, making PNN implementation computationally expensive and inefficient.

Method: The researchers developed a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing platform that leverages intrinsic magnetic stochasticity from spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls. The platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced domain wall stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) to enable fully electrical and tunable probabilistic functionality at the device level.

Result: The MPC platform was demonstrated through implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network for CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS implementations, the approach achieved seven orders of magnitude improvement in overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency, energy consumption, and processing speed.

Conclusion: The MPC platform demonstrates significant potential for enabling reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems by providing an energy-efficient, scalable hardware solution for uncertainty-aware computing that outperforms traditional CMOS approaches by leveraging physics-driven probabilistic processing.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring
reliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks
offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without
inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical
domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have
emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty
quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed
for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This
poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic
processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this
challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an
energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic
magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven
strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and
their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing
for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW
stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic
functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we
implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its
functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS
implementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement
in the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,
energy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's
potential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies prompt programming practices by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks and 51 questions that prompt programmers face, finding that current tools inadequately support these needs with most important questions remaining unanswered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of foundation models and prompt-based programming, developers are embedding prompts in software applications. However, it's unclear what specific tasks and questions prompt programmers encounter during development, and whether existing research and commercial tools adequately address their needs.

Method: The researchers conducted interviews with 16 prompt programmers, observed 8 developers making prompt changes, and surveyed 50 developers to develop a comprehensive taxonomy. They then compared this taxonomy against 48 existing research and commercial prompt programming tools to assess support gaps.

Result: The study identified 25 distinct tasks and 51 questions that prompt programmers deal with. Analysis revealed that all tasks are performed manually, and 16 out of 51 questions (including the majority of the most important ones) remain unanswered by current tools, indicating poor support for prompt programming workflows.

Conclusion: Prompt programming is currently not well-supported by existing tools, with significant gaps in addressing developers' most critical needs. The research outlines important opportunities for developing better prompt programming tools that can automate tasks and answer the key questions identified in their taxonomy.

Abstract: Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have
enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that
previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding
prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt
programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet,
the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the
answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With
the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is
unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We
address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt
programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task
and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make
prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48
research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not
well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions --
including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on
this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of training data detection (TDD) methods for code large language models, introducing CodeSnitch benchmark and testing robustness across different code mutation strategies to assess privacy and intellectual property protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CodeLLMs occasionally produce outputs containing proprietary or sensitive code snippets, raising concerns about non-compliant use of training data and risks to privacy and intellectual property. While TDD methods show promise in natural language, their effectiveness on structured code data remains underexplored, creating a critical gap for responsible CodeLLM deployment.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods across eight CodeLLMs using CodeSnitch, a new function-level benchmark dataset with 9,000 code samples in three programming languages. They design targeted mutation strategies based on Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy to test robustness under different settings.

Result: The study provides systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code, evaluating performance across multiple CodeLLMs and testing robustness under various mutation strategies. CodeSnitch serves as a comprehensive benchmark with explicitly labeled training inclusion/exclusion data for reliable evaluation.

Conclusion: The research offers the first comprehensive evaluation of TDD methods specifically for code data, revealing gaps in current approaches and providing insights to guide development of more effective and robust detection methods for ensuring responsible CodeLLM deployment in the future.

Abstract: Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them
indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models
occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code
snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data,
and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible
and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become
a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural
language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely
underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured
syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To
address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven
state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance
across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a
function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three
programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded
from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design
targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three
distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the
well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study
provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers
insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection
methods in the future.

*Shan Jiang,Pranoy Kovuri,David Tao,Zhixun Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CASCADE is a hybrid JavaScript deobfuscation approach that combines Gemini's AI capabilities with JavaScript IR transformations to effectively recover obfuscated code semantics, eliminating the need for thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving better reliability and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JavaScript obfuscation significantly hinders code comprehension and analysis, creating major challenges for software testing, static analysis, and malware detection. Existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques have limitations and require extensive hardcoded rules, making them inflexible and unreliable.

Abstract: In the design of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, accurately
identifying customer types and offering personalized services are key to
enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, this process faces the
challenge of discerning customer voices and intentions, and general pre-trained
automatic speech recognition (ASR) models make it difficult to effectively

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) and a hierarchical framework (L1-L5) to capture implicit communication signals in speech that go beyond explicit semantics, revealing that current spoken language models struggle to interpret these richer contextual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech technologies like ASR and TTS fail to capture implicit signals and contextual cues that are critical in human communication beyond explicit semantics, limiting their ability to achieve human-like social interaction.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical framework called Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) and formalize Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) using cognitive relevance theories and machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics across five dimensions.

Result: Evaluation across five dimensions reveals that current spoken language models (SLMs) struggle to fully interpret beyond-semantic signals including emotions, contexts, affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity for advancing BoSS research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication that can better understand communicative intentions and scenarios beyond explicit semantic content.

Abstract: Human communication involves more than explicit semantics, with implicit
signals and contextual cues playing a critical role in shaping meaning.
However, modern speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and Text-to-Speech (TTS) often fail to capture these beyond-semantic
dimensions. To better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech
intelligence, we introduce Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5),
a hierarchical framework illustrated the evolution of spoken dialogue systems
from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. To support
these advanced capabilities, we propose Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), which
refers to the set of information in speech communication that encompasses but
transcends explicit semantics. It conveys emotions, contexts, and modifies or
extends meanings through multidimensional features such as affective cues,
contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, thereby enhancing the
understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios. We present a
formalized framework for BoSS, leveraging cognitive relevance theories and
machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics. We
evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions, reveals that
current spoken language models (SLMs) are hard to fully interpret
beyond-semantic signals. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS
research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.

*Tobias Morocutti,Jonathan Greif,Paul Primus,Florian Schmid,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) that improves upon conventional two-stage pipelines by integrating sound event detection with source separation through fine-tuned Transformers and iterative refinement, achieving second place in DCASE Challenge 2025 Task 4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional S5 systems using two-stage pipelines (audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation) are limited by the absence of fine-grained temporal information, which is critical for effective sound source separation from complex acoustic mixtures.

Method: The approach uses three key components: (1) fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer for active sound class detection, (2) utilizing a separate instance of the fine-tuned Transformer for sound event detection (SED) to provide detailed time-varying guidance to the separation module, and (3) implementing an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations.

Result: The system achieved significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, demonstrated by securing second place in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. The enhanced synergy between event detection and source separation stages led to better overall S5 performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of conventional S5 systems by incorporating fine-grained temporal information through sound event detection and iterative refinement, resulting in substantial performance improvements in spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes.

Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate
identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their
sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a
two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source
separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal
information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy
between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions
are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active
sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned
Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation
module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by
recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These
advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source
separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in
Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework combining real-time MRI and speech signals for classifying articulatory-phonological features, achieving state-of-the-art performance with contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion (F1-score of 0.81).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features is crucial for understanding human speech production and developing robust speech technologies, especially in clinical contexts for targeted phonemic analysis, therapy, disease diagnosis, and personalized rehabilitation.

Method: The authors develop a multimodal deep learning framework that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals to classify three articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing. They evaluate four configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio, multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.

Result: The contrastive learning-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the USC-TIMIT dataset with an average F1-score of 0.81, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal baseline. The system successfully classifies 15 phonological classes derived from the three articulatory dimensions.

Conclusion: The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation learning for multimodal articulatory analysis, demonstrating that combining rtMRI and audio signals through contrastive learning significantly improves articulatory-phonological feature classification compared to unimodal approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features plays a vital
role in understanding human speech production and developing robust speech
technologies, particularly in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic

that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals
to classify three key articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of

derived from the aforementioned articulatory dimensions and evaluate the system
with four audio/vision configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio signals,
multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.
Experimental results on the USC-TIMIT dataset show that our contrastive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional heuristic-based methods like BLAST, which struggle with scalability, high computational costs, and poor performance on divergent sequences. There is an urgent need for efficient computational approaches to support large-scale similarity search in bioinformatics.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art vector search libraries (FAISS and ScaNN) using biologically meaningful gene embeddings that capture deeper structural and functional patterns beyond raw sequence alignment. They focus on bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmark their utility for detecting novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking known homologs.

Result: The embedding-based methods demonstrated both computational advantages (improved memory and runtime efficiency) and enhanced retrieval quality compared to traditional alignment-heavy tools, showing promise as an alternative approach for bioinformatics similarity search tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding-based similarity search methods using vector search libraries like FAISS and ScaNN offer a promising alternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools for bioinformatics applications, providing better scalability, computational efficiency, and retrieval quality for large-scale DNA sequence analysis.

Abstract: The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional
heuristic-based methods, which struggle to scale effectively. Efficient
computational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity
search, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology,
functional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences.
Although tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many
scenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and
poor performance on divergent sequences.
  In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn
latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns
beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art
vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene

bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting
novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking
known homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory

*Charlotte Jennings,Andrew Broad,Lucy Godson,Emily Clarke,David Westhead,Darren Treanor*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A systematic review of 48 studies found that multimodal machine learning combining histopathology images and molecular data shows promise for cancer survival prediction, but all studies had methodological limitations and lacked proper clinical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer prognostication could be improved by integrating multiple data types. The authors aimed to systematically evaluate how well multimodal approaches combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics data can predict overall survival in cancer patients.

Method: Systematic review following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Searched EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases plus citation screening. Used CHARMS for data extraction, PROBAST+AI for bias assessment, and SWiM for synthesis. Included studies that combined WSIs with omics data to predict overall survival.

Result: Identified 48 eligible studies (all published since 2017) across 19 cancer types, all using The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Methods included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). C-indices ranged from 0.550-0.857, with multimodal models typically outperforming unimodal approaches. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias risk and had limited external validation.

Conclusion: Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a rapidly growing field with promising performance metrics, but the field requires improved methodological rigor, validation on broader datasets beyond TCGA, and proper clinical evaluation before implementation in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGNITE, a comprehensive multi-stain dataset of 887 annotated NSCLC whole-slide images from 155 patients for developing computational pathology algorithms, featuring the first public annotations of metastatic sites and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital pathology datasets for NSCLC are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent metastatic sites, and lack molecular information like PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, which are crucial for developing computational tools to quantify tumor immune microenvironment characteristics that predict immunotherapy response.

Method: The researchers created a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset called IGNITE with 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique NSCLC patients, providing annotations for three complementary tasks: multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E slides (16 classes), nuclei detection, and PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Result: The IGNITE dataset provides the first public NSCLC dataset with manual annotations of H&E staining in metastatic sites and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, enabling comprehensive computational analysis of tumor immune microenvironment characteristics across primary and metastatic NSCLC sites.

Conclusion: The IGNITE data toolkit addresses critical gaps in available NSCLC digital pathology datasets by providing comprehensive annotations including metastatic sites and molecular markers, which will support the development of computational biomarkers for immunotherapy response prediction in NSCLC patients.

Abstract: The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) histopathology contains morphological and molecular characteristics
predictive of immunotherapy response. Computational quantification of TIME
characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support
biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets
of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation
algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent
metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data
toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated
NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of
interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i)
multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides,
with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection,
and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first public NSCLC dataset with manual
annotations of H&E in metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC.

*Yalda Zafari,Roaa Elalfy,Mohamed Mabrok,Somaya Al-Maadeed,Tamer Khattab,Essam A. Rashed*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework combining CNNs and Visual State Space Models (VSSMs) for multi-view mammography analysis that jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS scores, achieving superior performance compared to baseline models across various classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches for mammography screening are limited by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, which reduces their clinical utility. Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms remains challenging due to subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity, necessitating a more comprehensive approach.

Method: The authors developed a multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four standard mammography views simultaneously. The architecture combines a hybrid CNN-VSSM backbone (CNNs for local feature extraction and VSSMs for global contextual dependencies) with a gated attention-based fusion module that dynamically weights information across views and handles missing data cases.

Result: The hybrid models consistently outperformed baseline CNN and VSSM architectures across all tasks. For binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification, the model achieved AUC of 0.9967 and F1 score of 0.9830. For ternary classification, F1 score reached 0.7790, and for five-class BI-RADS classification, the best F1 score was 0.4904.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively combines the strengths of CNNs and VSSMs for mammography analysis, demonstrating the potential of multitask learning for improving diagnostic performance. However, the results also highlight limitations in more complex classification tasks, indicating areas for future improvement in clinically meaningful mammography analysis.

Abstract: Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual
State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To
improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based
fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively
handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.

TL;DR: This review paper comprehensively examines medical image harmonization techniques, particularly for MRI, focusing on methods to eliminate site-related biases and batch effects that reduce reproducibility and model generalizability across different imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data collected across different scanners, protocols, or sites exhibit substantial heterogeneity (batch/site effects) that obscure biological signals, reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and impair the generalizability of learning models across datasets. There is a critical need for harmonization methods to improve data comparability and consistency.

Method: The paper provides a systematic review categorizing harmonization approaches into: (1) prospective acquisition and reconstruction strategies, (2) retrospective image-level and feature-level methods, and (3) traveling-subject-based techniques. The review covers the full imaging pipeline with particular emphasis on deep learning-based approaches and representative methods rather than exhaustive coverage.

Result: The review presents a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, and current state-of-the-art harmonization techniques in medical imaging, with specific focus on MRI harmonization methods across different categories of approaches.

Conclusion: The paper identifies major remaining challenges in medical image harmonization and outlines promising avenues for future research. Image harmonization is essential for eliminating site-related biases while preserving meaningful biological information to improve data comparability, consistency, and model generalizability in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience
research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across
different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit
substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These
non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals,
reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the
generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization
aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving
meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and
consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts,
methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and
future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging
pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition
and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level
methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an
exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis
on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges
that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.

TL;DR: SmartPath-R1 is a versatile multimodal large language model for computational pathology that combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning to perform both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks with enhanced reasoning capabilities, trained on 2.3M ROI and 188K WSI samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs in pathology have constrained reasoning capabilities due to reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations and are limited to simple visual question answering at ROI level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs including classification, detection, segmentation, and WSI analysis required in clinical practice.

Method: The approach combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning to circumvent chain-of-thought supervision requirements by leveraging intrinsic MLLM knowledge. It integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism for dynamic processing across diverse pathology tasks.

Result: SmartPath-R1 demonstrates robust pathological reasoning capability and can simultaneously address both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach using a curated dataset of 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology that can handle the full spectrum of diagnostic tasks required in clinical practice without expensive chain-of-thought annotations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced

Abstract: Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and
progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in
formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic
homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image
segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics,
resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a
sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global
contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion
regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to
further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a
focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more
precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU
and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion
detection.

*Farnoush Bayatmakou,Reza Taleei,Nicole Simone,Arash Mohammadi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Mammo-Mamba is a novel AI framework for breast cancer detection in mammograms that combines Selective State-Space Models with transformer attention and expert-driven feature refinement, achieving superior performance while being more computationally efficient than traditional Transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. While current state-of-the-art multi-view mammogram classification models use Transformer architectures, their computational complexity scales quadratically with image patches, creating a need for more efficient alternatives for accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation in early detection.

Method: The paper proposes Mammo-Mamba, which integrates Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven feature refinement. It extends the MambaVision backbone by introducing Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE) mechanism through customized SecMamba blocks that enable content-adaptive feature refinement in high-resolution mammographic images with dynamic expert gating.

Result: Mammo-Mamba achieves superior classification performance across all key metrics on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset while maintaining computational efficiency compared to traditional Transformer models.

Conclusion: The proposed Mammo-Mamba framework successfully addresses the computational limitations of Transformer-based models while achieving better performance in breast cancer detection from mammograms, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining SSMs with expert-driven feature refinement for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency.

### [232] [MCM: Mamba-based Cardiac Motion Tracking using Sequential Images in MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17678)
*Jiahui Yin,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan,Yan Pang,Declan O'Regan,Hadrien Reynaud,Qingjie Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MCM, a Mamba-based network for cardiac motion tracking from cine CMR images that uses sequential cardiac cycle information to achieve smoother and more temporally consistent motion estimation compared to existing single image pair methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion tracking methods learn from single image pairs (reference + randomly selected target frame), which overlooks the continuous nature of cardiac motion and produces inconsistent, non-smooth motion estimations that don't capture the temporal dynamics of the cardiac cycle.

Method: The authors develop a Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) with: (1) bi-directional Mamba blocks with bi-directional scanning mechanism for plausible deformation field estimation, (2) a motion decoder that integrates information from frames adjacent to the target frame for temporal coherence, and (3) leverages Mamba's structured state-space formulation to learn continuous myocardium dynamics from sequential images without increased computational complexity.

Result: Experimental evaluation on two public datasets shows the proposed MCM method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods in terms of motion estimation accuracy and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed Mamba-based approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking methods by incorporating sequential temporal information to achieve smooth, temporally consistent motion tracking while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating superior performance for myocardial motion assessment in cine CMR imaging.

Abstract: Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing
methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame
and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these
methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield
inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a
novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly
incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and
temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba
block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates
the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion
decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target
frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking
advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method
learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without
increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two
public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and
state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods. The code is

*Felix Huber,Sebastian Rojas Gonzalez,Raul Astudillo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A Bayesian approach for efficiently identifying preferred solutions from multi-objective optimization Pareto sets using interactive pairwise comparisons and principled query selection to balance exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-makers face difficulty efficiently identifying their preferred solutions from the large Pareto set in multi-objective optimization problems, requiring a systematic approach to discover high-utility solutions with minimal effort.

Method: Uses a Bayesian model to estimate decision-maker's utility function from pairwise comparisons, combined with a principled elicitation strategy that interactively selects queries to balance exploration and exploitation for discovering high-utility solutions.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with few queries on test problems up to nine objectives, and generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions to simplify decision-making.

Conclusion: The flexible approach can work interactively or post-hoc after Pareto front estimation, effectively simplifies multi-objective decision-making, and is made available as open-source implementation for broader adoption.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify
preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization
problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's
utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a
principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance
exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions.
The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after
estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization
techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a
reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making
process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our
method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with
a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our
method to support its adoption by the broader community.

### [234] [Fundamental limits of distributed covariance matrix estimation via a conditional strong data processing inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16953)
*Mohammad Reza Rahmani,Mohammad Hossein Yassaee,Mohammad Reza Aref*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes theoretical limits for distributed covariance matrix estimation when agents observe different features and communicate with limited bits, introducing a novel Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient to derive nearly tight minimax bounds and optimal protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional covariance matrix estimation is crucial across many fields, but existing work often assumes infinite samples or Gaussian distributions. There's a need to understand theoretical limits of distributed estimation when communication is constrained and agents observe different feature components of the data.

Method: The authors introduce the Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, which generalizes the conventional SDPI and quantifies average contraction in state-dependent channels. They use the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and operator Jensen inequality to compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels, then employ it to establish minimax lower bounds.

Result: The paper obtains nearly tight minimax lower bounds for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and Frobenius norm. They present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The analysis shows interaction can significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive schemes.

Conclusion: The framework provides fundamental theoretical understanding of trade-offs among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality in distributed covariance estimation without requiring infinite samples or Gaussian assumptions, making it broadly applicable. Interactive protocols offer substantial communication savings over non-interactive approaches.

Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices is a key task across many
fields. This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance
estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is
constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each
observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random
vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using
a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight
minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and
Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong
data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data
Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI
coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional
SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent
channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient
over the state input.
  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,
we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to
establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs
among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on
this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and
communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.
Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite
samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we
extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can
significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive
schemes.

### [235] [The surprising strength of weak classifiers for validating neural posterior estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17026)
*Vansh Bansal,Tianyu Chen,James G. Scott*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conformal variant of the classifier two-sample test (C2ST) that can reliably validate neural posterior estimates even when using weak or overfit classifiers, providing exact finite-sample p-values and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating neural posterior estimation accuracy have major limitations, particularly the standard C2ST which requires near-Bayes-optimal classifiers that are rarely achievable in practice. There's a need for reliable validation methods that work with practical, potentially weak classifiers.

Method: The authors develop a conformal variant of the C2ST that converts any trained classifier's scores into exact finite-sample p-values. This approach builds on conformal prediction theory to provide statistical guarantees regardless of classifier quality.

Result: The conformal C2ST achieves: (1) finite-sample Type-I error control, (2) non-trivial statistical power that degrades gracefully with classifier error, and (3) superior empirical performance compared to classical discriminative tests across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can provide powerful and reliable tests for neural posterior validation. The conformal C2ST establishes a practical and theoretically grounded diagnostic tool for modern simulation-based inference.

Abstract: Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has emerged as a powerful approach for
amortized Bayesian inference when the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ is
intractable or difficult to sample. But evaluating the accuracy of neural
posterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from
major limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier
two-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples
from the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation
$q(\theta \mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its
theoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a
near-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,
difficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still
be useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.
Building on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a
conformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores
-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample
p-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:
(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that
degrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot
is that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and
reliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical
discriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks. These results reveal
the under appreciated strength of weak classifiers for validating neural
posterior estimates, establishing the conformal C2ST as a practical,
theoretically grounded diagnostic for modern simulation-based inference.

### [236] [CoLT: The conditional localization test for assessing the accuracy of neural posterior estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17030)
*Tianyu Chen,Vansh Bansal,James G. Scott*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conditional Localization Test (CoLT), a new method for validating neural posterior estimates by learning a localization function that adaptively identifies regions where the neural posterior deviates most from the true posterior, outperforming existing classifier-based and divergence-based validation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating neural posterior estimate quality (such as classifier-based tests and divergence measures) suffer from practical drawbacks when validating whether a neural posterior q(θ|x) accurately approximates the true posterior p(θ|x). There is a need for a more principled and scalable approach that can detect discrepancies across the full range of conditioning inputs without requiring exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every point.

Method: The Conditional Localization Test (CoLT) learns a localization function that adaptively selects points θ_l(x) where the neural posterior q deviates most strongly from the true posterior p for each conditioning input x. This approach leverages the typical simulation-based inference setting where only a single draw from the true posterior is observed but the neural posterior can be sampled arbitrarily many times.

Result: CoLT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods at comparing neural and true posteriors. The method successfully pinpoints regions of significant divergence between the distributions and provides actionable insights for model refinement. Theoretical results establish necessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality across all conditioning inputs.

Conclusion: CoLT offers both rigorous theoretical guarantees and practical scalability for validating neural posterior estimates. By providing better performance than existing methods and the ability to identify specific regions of divergence, CoLT positions itself as a state-of-the-art solution for neural posterior validation in simulation-based inference settings.

Abstract: We consider the problem of validating whether a neural posterior estimate \(
q(\theta \mid x) \) is an accurate approximation to the true, unknown true
posterior \( p(\theta \mid x) \). Existing methods for evaluating the quality
of an NPE estimate are largely derived from classifier-based tests or
divergence measures, but these suffer from several practical drawbacks. As an
alternative, we introduce the \emph{Conditional Localization Test} (CoLT), a
principled method designed to detect discrepancies between \( p(\theta \mid x)
\) and \( q(\theta \mid x) \) across the full range of conditioning inputs.
Rather than relying on exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every \(
x \), CoLT learns a localization function that adaptively selects points
$\theta_l(x)$ where the neural posterior $q$ deviates most strongly from the
true posterior $p$ for that $x$. This approach is particularly advantageous in
typical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \( \theta
\sim p(\theta \mid x) \) from the true posterior is observed for each
conditioning input, but where the neural posterior \( q(\theta \mid x) \) can
be sampled an arbitrary number of times. Our theoretical results establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality
across all \( x \), offering both rigorous guarantees and practical
scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoLT not only performs better
than existing methods at comparing $p$ and $q$, but also pinpoints regions of
significant divergence, providing actionable insights for model refinement.
These properties position CoLT as a state-of-the-art solution for validating
neural posterior estimates.

*Dirk van der Hoeven,Julia Olkhovskaia,Tim van Erven*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the problem of estimating discrete distributions with finite support, providing both upper and lower bounds for KL divergence with high probability, and introduces an efficient estimator that nearly matches the lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the fundamental limits of discrete distribution estimation in terms of KL divergence and to develop computationally efficient estimators that achieve near-optimal performance with high probability guarantees.

Method: The authors prove lower bounds using information-theoretic techniques and introduce a computationally efficient estimator called p^OTB based on Online to Batch conversion and suffix averaging. They also analyze the maximum likelihood estimator's performance using chi-squared divergence bounds.

Result: They establish a lower bound showing any estimator has KL divergence at least C·max{K, ln(K)ln(1/δ)}/n with probability δ. Their p^OTB estimator achieves KL divergence at most C(K·log(log(K)) + ln(K)ln(1/δ))/n with probability 1-δ, nearly matching the lower bound. For MLE, they provide chi-squared to KL divergence relationships.

Conclusion: The paper provides nearly tight characterization of discrete distribution estimation in KL divergence, with the proposed p^OTB estimator being computationally efficient and achieving near-optimal performance that almost matches the fundamental lower bounds.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a discrete distribution $p$ with
support of size $K$ and provide both upper and lower bounds with high
probability in KL divergence. We prove that in the worst case, for any
estimator $\widehat{p}$, with probability at least $\delta$, $\text{KL}(p \|
\widehat{p}) \geq C\max\{K,\ln(K)\ln(1/\delta) \}/n $, where $n$ is the sample
size and $C > 0$ is a constant. We introduce a computationally efficient
estimator $p^{\text{OTB}}$, based on Online to Batch conversion and suffix
averaging, and show that with probability at least $1 - \delta$ $\text{KL}(p \|
\widehat{p}) \leq C(K\log(\log(K)) + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)) /n$.
  Furthermore, we also show that with sufficiently many observations relative
to $\log(1/\delta)$, the maximum likelihood estimator $\bar{p}$ guarantees that
with probability at least $1-\delta$ $$
  1/6 \chi^2(\bar{p}\|p) \leq 1/4 \chi^2(p\|\bar{p}) \leq \text{KL}(p|\bar{p})
\leq C(K + \log(1/\delta))/n\,, $$ where $\chi^2$ denotes the
$\chi^2$-divergence.

*Rashika Raina,Nidhi Simmons,David E. Simmons,Michel Daoud Yacoub,Trung Q. Duong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the calibration performance of ML-based outage predictors in multi-resource allocation systems, establishing theoretical properties of outage probability under perfect calibration and demonstrating that well-calibrated models improve system reliability in communication networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation communication networks require ML models that provide not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores reflecting the true likelihood of correct decisions. Understanding how calibration affects outage probability in multi-resource allocation systems is crucial for meeting specific reliability requirements in communication networks.

Method: The authors establish theoretical properties of outage probability under perfect calibration for single-user, multi-resource allocation frameworks. They derive conditions for perfectly calibrated predictors, analyze the relationship between calibration and system performance, and conduct simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques (Platt scaling and isotonic regression) with outage loss functions on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation.

Result: Key findings include: (1) As the number of resources grows, outage probability of perfectly calibrated predictors approaches the expected output conditioned on being below the classification threshold, (2) With one resource, system outage probability equals the model's overall expected output, (3) Post-processing calibration cannot improve minimum achievable outage probability, and (4) Well-calibrated models belong to a class of predictors that necessarily improve outage probability through a monotonicity condition on the accuracy-confidence function.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical guidance for choosing classification thresholds to achieve desired outage probabilities in communication systems. Well-calibrated ML models fundamentally improve system reliability, and the established theoretical framework helps system designers meet specific reliability requirements in next-generation communication networks.

Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models
are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated
confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This
paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor
within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish
key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under
perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources
grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected
output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,
when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall
expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated
predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to
achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability
requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot
improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new
information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that
well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that
necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition
that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to
occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous
simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt
scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is
trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.
Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with
temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver
mobility.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel differentially private kernel learning algorithm using random projection in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces that achieves minimax-optimal excess risk while providing dimension-free generalization bounds for private linear ERM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize differentially private kernel learning within empirical risk minimization framework while balancing privacy protection and learning utility, addressing limitations of existing approaches that yield suboptimal generalization performance.

Method: A differentially private kernel ERM algorithm based on random projection in reproducing kernel Hilbert space using Gaussian processes, combined with objective perturbation techniques rather than noisy gradient-based mechanisms.

Result: The algorithm achieves minimax-optimal excess risk for squared loss and Lipschitz-smooth convex loss functions under local strong convexity. Derives first dimension-free generalization bounds for objective perturbation-based private linear ERM and obtains sharper bounds for existing differentially private kernel ERM algorithms.

Conclusion: Random projection enables statistically efficient and optimally private kernel learning, outperforming alternative dimension reduction techniques like random Fourier features or ℓ2 regularization. The work highlights dimension reduction as central to balancing privacy and utility in differentially private algorithms.

Abstract: Differential privacy has become a cornerstone in the development of
privacy-preserving learning algorithms. This work addresses optimizing
differentially private kernel learning within the empirical risk minimization
(ERM) framework. We propose a novel differentially private kernel ERM algorithm
based on random projection in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space using
Gaussian processes. Our method achieves minimax-optimal excess risk for both
the squared loss and Lipschitz-smooth convex loss functions under a local
strong convexity condition. We further show that existing approaches based on
alternative dimension reduction techniques, such as random Fourier feature
mappings or $\ell_2$ regularization, yield suboptimal generalization
performance. Our key theoretical contribution also includes the derivation of
dimension-free generalization bounds for objective perturbation-based private
linear ERM -- marking the first such result that does not rely on noisy
gradient-based mechanisms. Additionally, we obtain sharper generalization
bounds for existing differentially private kernel ERM algorithms. Empirical
evaluations support our theoretical claims, demonstrating that random
projection enables statistically efficient and optimally private kernel
learning. These findings provide new insights into the design of differentially
private algorithms and highlight the central role of dimension reduction in
balancing privacy and utility.

*Takashi Hayakawa,Satoshi Asai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning-based alternative to the Cox model for causal inference in survival analysis, addressing the uninterpretability of hazard ratios by explicitly modeling risk set changes and using debiased maximum-likelihood estimators based on Neyman orthogonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed that hazard ratios from Cox models are uninterpretable because the indefinite baseline hazard fails to identify temporal changes in risk set composition due to treatment assignment and unobserved factors. This problem is particularly severe in observational studies with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time covariate measurement.

Method: The authors propose abandoning the baseline hazard and using machine learning to explicitly model changes in the risk set with or without latent variables. They develop a method based on Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of hazard ratios, which is more computationally efficient than weighted regression with marginal structural Cox models.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the ground truth with minimal bias and is computationally more efficient than existing approaches based on marginal structural Cox models.

Conclusion: The results establish a foundation for developing an alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled, observational data in modern epidemiology, providing a more interpretable and efficient approach to survival analysis in complex observational settings.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that hazard ratios between treatment groups
estimated with the Cox model are uninterpretable because the indefinite
baseline hazard of the model fails to identify temporal change in the risk set
composition due to treatment assignment and unobserved factors among multiple,
contradictory scenarios. To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based
on observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time
measurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and
using machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or
without latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which
hazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on
Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of
hazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than
computing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox
models. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the
ground truth with minimal bias. These results lay the foundation for developing
a useful, alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled,
observational data in modern epidemiology.

### [241] [Sequential Bayesian Design for Efficient Surrogate Construction in the Inversion of Darcy Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17713)
*Hongji Wang,Hongqiao Wang,Jinyong Ying,Qingping Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes SBD-LAS, a sequential Bayesian design method that creates locally accurate surrogate models for solving inverse problems in PDEs (particularly Darcy flow equations) by focusing on high-probability likelihood regions, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian methods for solving PDE inverse problems require numerous evaluations of expensive forward solvers. While surrogate models can reduce computational costs, constructing globally accurate surrogates for high-dimensional complex problems demands high model capacity and large training datasets, which is computationally prohibitive.

Method: The paper develops SBD-LAS (Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate), which creates locally accurate surrogates focusing on high-probability regions of the true likelihood rather than global accuracy. A sequential Bayesian design strategy is used to identify these high-probability regions, treating the posterior evolution as a Gaussian process and using one-step ahead prior for algorithmic acceleration.

Result: Three experiments based on Darcy flow equations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both inversion accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches, requiring relatively low model complexity and fewer training data.

Conclusion: The SBD-LAS framework successfully addresses the computational challenges of Bayesian inverse problems by strategically focusing surrogate model accuracy on the most important regions, providing an efficient solution for PDE inverse problems in fluid mechanics and other applications.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) play a
crucial role in various fields, including computational science, image
processing, and engineering. Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental
equation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid
flow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for
solving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires
numerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,
the adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.
However, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional
complex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To
address this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate
surrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood
in inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data
requirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy
to acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the
likelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of
sequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic
acceleration through one-step ahead prior. The complete algorithmic framework
is referred to as Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate
(SBD-LAS). Finally, three experiments based the Darcy flow equation demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both inversion accuracy and
computational speed.

### [242] [Budget Allocation Policies for Real-Time Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16874)
*Raz Beck,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses Real-Time Multi-Agent Pathfinding (RT-MAPF) by exploring different policies for allocating planning budgets in windowed MAPF algorithms, finding that distributing budgets across agents outperforms shared budget approaches in constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RT-MAPF solutions use windowed MAPF algorithms without explicitly considering planning budget allocation. Real-world scenarios require agents to make planning decisions within fixed time constraints, but current approaches inefficiently share computational resources among all agents, leading to poor performance in over-constrained situations.

Method: The authors explore different policies for allocating planning budgets in windowed versions of standard MAPF algorithms, specifically Prioritized Planning (PrP) and MAPF-LNS2. They compare baseline shared budget pooling approaches against policies that distribute the planning budget across individual agents.

Result: The baseline approach where all agents draw from a shared planning budget pool proves ineffective in over-constrained situations. Policies that distribute the planning budget over individual agents are able to solve more problems with smaller makespan compared to shared budget approaches.

Conclusion: Distributing planning budgets across agents rather than using a shared pool significantly improves RT-MAPF performance, enabling better problem-solving capabilities and reduced makespan in constrained scenarios. This suggests that individualized resource allocation is crucial for effective real-time multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of
agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding
collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run
offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them.
Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot
wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to
move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must
commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time,
referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively
call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without
explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and
explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed
versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and
MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents
draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained
situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the
agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.

*Chengxuan Xia,Qianye Wu,Sixuan Tian,Yilun Hao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new coordination framework for multi-agent LLM systems that enables dynamic adaptation through task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel evaluation, showing improved performance over static approaches in collaborative task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited communication, which reduces their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. There is a need for more adaptive coordination mechanisms that can handle dynamic task allocation and complex inter-agent interactions.

Method: The framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) dynamic task routing that allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, (2) bidirectional feedback enabling agents to exchange structured critiques for iterative improvement, and (3) parallel agent evaluation where multiple agents compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the best results.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency compared to static and partially adaptive baselines when implemented in a modular architecture.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems, showing that dynamic coordination mechanisms can enhance collaborative task completion performance over traditional static approaches.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for
collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often
rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication,
reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper
proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core
mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent
evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence
and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and
crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of
the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular
architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage,
coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our
findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and
structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.

*Mariam ALMutairi,Hyungmin Kim*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining blockchain technology with LLM-powered multi-agent systems to improve medical supply chain resilience during health emergencies like COVID-19, enabling autonomous agents to negotiate resource allocation while ensuring transparency and accountability through smart contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global health emergencies like COVID-19 have revealed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficient resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions, necessitating a more resilient and accountable system for crisis management.

Method: The authors develop a hybrid framework integrating blockchain technology with a decentralized LLM-powered multi-agent negotiation system, where autonomous agents representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions engage in structured negotiations facilitated by LLMs, with off-chain adaptive reasoning and on-chain enforcement via smart contracts, supported by a formal cross-layer communication protocol.

Result: Simulation experiments in pandemic scenarios demonstrate improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of resource allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability compared to traditional approaches, validating the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates that synergizing blockchain trust guarantees with LLM-driven agent intelligence provides a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty, offering an innovative approach to enhance medical supply chain resilience during global health emergencies.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed
critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including
inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor
adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid
framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large
language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the
resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this
system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and
healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and
decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical
allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports
adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain
layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions
via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer
communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional
enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates
the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency,
fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This
research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust
guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a
robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under
uncertainty.

*Hugh Adams,Srijoni Majumdar,Evangelos Pournaras*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach with branching neural networks to support decision-making in participatory budgeting, helping voters develop better voting strategies and policymakers design fairer elections by finding compromises through smaller-cost projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Participatory budgeting suffers from "choice overload" where citizens struggle to make decisions on numerous projects when voting on budget allocation. There's a need for decision support tools that can help voters make better choices while ensuring fair distribution of public funds and enabling policymakers to design more equitable election processes.

Method: The paper employs multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with a novel branching neural network architecture to model participatory budgeting scenarios. The approach works in a decentralized manner to overcome scalability challenges and optimizes voter actions to achieve greater representation of voter preferences in winning project sets.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real-world participatory budgeting data shows that fair compromises can be achieved, with a notable pattern emerging that fair compromise is attainable through projects with smaller costs. The approach successfully identifies voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of votes.

Conclusion: The multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with branching neural networks provides an effective, ethically aligned solution for participatory budgeting decision support. It enables both voters to make better-informed decisions and policymakers to design fairer election processes, with smaller-cost projects being key to achieving fair compromises.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and
addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it
is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds.
Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can
lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to
decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying
voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This
novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of
election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a
novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a
branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of
multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are
found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter
preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world
participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is
achievable through projects with smaller cost.

### [246] [Towards Robust Speech Recognition for Jamaican Patois Music Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16834)
*Jordan Madden,Matthew Stone,Dimitri Johnson,Daniel Geddez*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Researchers created a 40+ hour manually transcribed Jamaican Patois music dataset to improve speech recognition systems, which currently perform poorly on Patois audio, and fine-tuned state-of-the-art ASR models to develop scaling laws for Whisper models on Jamaican Patois.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech recognition systems perform poorly on Jamaican Patois music, producing inaccurate captions that limit accessibility and hinder downstream applications for this widely spoken language.

Method: Data-centric approach involving curation of more than 40 hours of manually transcribed Patois music dataset, followed by fine-tuning state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and developing scaling laws for Whisper models on Jamaican Patois audio.

Result: Successfully created a substantial Jamaican Patois music dataset and established scaling laws for Whisper model performance on Jamaican Patois audio through fine-tuning experiments.

Conclusion: This work aims to positively impact the accessibility of Jamaican Patois music and advance the future of Jamaican Patois language modeling by addressing the gap in speech recognition performance for this underrepresented language.

Abstract: Although Jamaican Patois is a widely spoken language, current speech
recognition systems perform poorly on Patois music, producing inaccurate
captions that limit accessibility and hinder downstream applications. In this
work, we take a data-centric approach to this problem by curating more than 40
hours of manually transcribed Patois music. We use this dataset to fine-tune
state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, and use the results

### [247] [Segmentation-free Goodness of Pronunciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16838)
*Xinwei Cao,Zijian Fan,Torbjørn Svendsen,Giampiero Salvi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes improved methods for automatic pronunciation assessment in language learning systems by developing alignment-free approaches that work with modern CTC-based acoustic models, achieving state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mispronunciation detection systems rely on Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) methods that require pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic units, which limits accuracy and prevents the use of modern CTC-based acoustic models. There is a need for more flexible approaches that can leverage advanced ASR models without requiring precise alignment.

Method: The authors propose two novel approaches: (1) Self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables CTC-trained ASR models for mispronunciation detection, and (2) Alignment-free GOP (GOP-AF) that considers all possible alignments of target phonemes. They provide theoretical foundations, numerical implementation solutions, and proper normalization techniques to handle different acoustic model characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The GOP-AF method achieves state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment. The study also analyzes the dependency of GOP-AF on acoustic model peakiness and context around target phonemes.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment-free GOP methods successfully overcome limitations of traditional approaches by enabling the use of modern CTC-based acoustic models for pronunciation assessment. The GOP-AF method particularly shows superior performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results in phoneme-level pronunciation evaluation for computer-aided language learning systems.

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in
modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD,
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve
their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of
pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic
units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use
modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first
propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR
models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes
all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a
theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves
potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the
method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We
provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762
datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the
dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount
of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with
recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors
derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

*Nima Yazdani,Ali Ansari,Aruj Mahajan,Amirhossein Afsharrad,Seyed Shahabeddin Mousavi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale empirical comparison of different STT x LLM x TTS combinations for voice-based conversational AI systems using data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews, finding that Google STT with GPT-4.1 performs best technically but objective metrics poorly correlate with user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice-based conversational AI systems using cascaded STT-LLM-TTS architectures lack systematic evaluation of different component combinations in real production settings, making it difficult to optimize system performance and user experience.

Method: The researchers developed an automated evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities across four production configurations of STT x LLM x TTS stacks, analyzing data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews.

Result: Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly outperformed other combinations in conversational and technical quality metrics. However, objective quality metrics showed weak correlation with user satisfaction scores, indicating that user experience depends on factors beyond technical performance.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for component selection in multimodal conversational AI systems and establishes a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions, while revealing the complexity of optimizing for actual user satisfaction versus technical metrics.

Abstract: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded
architectures combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and
text-to-speech (TTS) components. However, systematic evaluation of different
component combinations in production settings remains understudied. We present
a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data from
over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We develop an automated evaluation
framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical
accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of four production
configurations reveals that Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly
outperforms alternatives in both conversational and technical quality metrics.
Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user
satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems
depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and
contribute a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions.

### [249] [Does Language Matter for Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease from Speech?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16832)
*Peter Plantinga,Briac Cordelle,Dominique Louër,Mirco Ravanelli,Denise Klein*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study investigates the role of language in detecting Parkinson's disease from speech samples by comparing different pretrained models across various data types and tasks, finding that language-based models can match vocal-feature performance and that multilingual approaches outperform monolingual ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is considerable disagreement in the literature about optimal methods for collecting and analyzing speech data as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease detection and monitoring. The field needs clarity on whether linguistic content or vocal features are more important for PD detection.

Method: The researchers tested pretrained models with varying data types (text-only vs. vocal features) and pretraining objectives, comparing performance across different speech tasks including sustained vowel phonation (SVP) and spontaneous speech. They evaluated multilingual vs. monolingual Whisper models and assessed the impact of AudioSet pretraining.

Result: Key findings include: (1) text-only models achieved performance equivalent to vocal-feature models, (2) multilingual Whisper significantly outperformed self-supervised models while monolingual Whisper performed worse, and (3) AudioSet pretraining enhanced performance on sustained vowel phonation but not on spontaneous speech tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that language plays a critical role in early detection of Parkinson's disease from speech samples, suggesting that linguistic content is as valuable as traditional vocal acoustic features for PD detection purposes.

Abstract: Using speech samples as a biomarker is a promising avenue for detecting and
monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is
considerable disagreement in the literature about how best to collect and
analyze such data. Early research in detecting PD from speech used a sustained
vowel phonation (SVP) task, while some recent research has explored recordings
of more cognitively demanding tasks. To assess the role of language in PD
detection, we tested pretrained models with varying data types and pretraining
objectives and found that (1) text-only models match the performance of
vocal-feature models, (2) multilingual Whisper outperforms self-supervised
models whereas monolingual Whisper does worse, and (3) AudioSet pretraining
improves performance on SVP but not spontaneous speech. These findings together
highlight the critical role of language for the early detection of Parkinson's
disease.

*Peter Plantinga,Jen-Kai Chen,Roozbeh Sattari,Mirco Ravanelli,Denise Klein*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to make deep learning models for Parkinson's disease detection from speech more interpretable, revealing clinically relevant biomarkers that correlate with brain imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning systems for speech-based Parkinson's disease detection are effective but lack interpretability, which hinders their clinical adoption. There's a need to understand what these black-box models are learning to make them more trustworthy for medical applications.

Method: The authors apply sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with a novel mask-based activation to extract interpretable representations from a speech-based PD detection system. They adapt SAEs specifically for small biomedical datasets to create sparse disentangled dictionary representations that can be mapped to clinical features.

Result: The SAE dictionary entries show strong associations with characteristic speech deficits in PD, including reduced spectral flux and increased spectral flatness in low-energy regions. The spectral flux measurements correlate with putamen volumetric measurements from MRI scans, establishing a connection between speech features and brain structure.

Conclusion: SAEs can successfully reveal clinically relevant and interpretable biomarkers from deep learning models trained on speech data for PD detection. This approach bridges the gap between model performance and clinical interpretability, potentially enabling better disease monitoring and diagnosis tools.

Abstract: Speech holds promise as a cost-effective and non-invasive biomarker for
neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). While deep learning
systems trained on raw audio can find subtle signals not available from
hand-crafted features, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption. To
address this, we apply sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to uncover interpretable
internal representations from a speech-based PD detection system. We introduce
a novel mask-based activation for adapting SAEs to small biomedical datasets,
creating sparse disentangled dictionary representations. These dictionary
entries are found to have strong associations with characteristic articulatory
deficits in PD speech, such as reduced spectral flux and increased spectral
flatness in the low-energy regions highlighted by the model attention. We
further show that the spectral flux is related to volumetric measurements of
the putamen from MRI scans, demonstrating the potential of SAEs to reveal
clinically relevant biomarkers for disease monitoring and diagnosis.

Motivation: Traditional lung disease diagnostic methods are costly, time-consuming, and invasive. There are challenges in lung sound detection including individual differences, feature variations, and insufficient labeled data. The study aims to develop a more efficient diagnostic approach that reduces dependence on manual annotations.

Method: The researchers used a combination of MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) as the base model, then enhanced it with semi-supervised learning modules including MixMatch, Co-Refinement, and Co-Refurbishing to improve lung sound signal detection performance.

Result: The MFCC+CNN model with semi-supervised learning modules achieved an accuracy rate of 92.9%, representing a 3.8% improvement compared to the baseline model without these additional modules.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning methods can effectively enhance lung sound detection performance while reducing the need for extensive manual annotations. This approach addresses key challenges in lung disease diagnosis and contributes to more efficient detection of conditions like lung cancer and COPD.

Abstract: Lung diseases, including lung cancer and COPD, are significant health
concerns globally. Traditional diagnostic methods can be costly,
time-consuming, and invasive. This study investigates the use of semi
supervised learning methods for lung sound signal detection using a model
combination of MFCC+CNN. By introducing semi supervised learning modules such
as Mix Match, Co-Refinement, and Co Refurbishing, we aim to enhance the
detection performance while reducing dependence on manual annotations. With the
add-on semi-supervised modules, the accuracy rate of the MFCC+CNN model is
92.9%, an increase of 3.8% to the baseline model. The research contributes to

*Isha Pandey,Pranav Gaikwad,Amruta Parulekar,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper investigates duration prediction strategies in speech generation for low-resource Indian languages, comparing different approaches using a Continuous Normalizing Flow-based model to understand trade-offs between intelligibility and speaker preservation in multilingual settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality speech generation for low-resource Indian languages faces challenges due to limited data and diverse linguistic structures. While recent generative approaches often omit explicit duration modeling, the authors want to retain and explore this module to understand its impact in linguistically rich but data-scarce Indian language contexts.

Method: The authors train a non-autoregressive Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) based speech model using publicly available Indian language data and evaluate multiple duration prediction strategies for zero-shot, speaker-specific generation through comparative analysis on speech-infilling tasks.

Result: The comparative analysis reveals nuanced trade-offs between different duration prediction strategies: infilling-based predictors improve intelligibility in some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors better preserve speaker characteristics in others, showing language-specific performance variations.

Conclusion: The findings inform the design and selection of duration strategies tailored to specific languages and tasks, demonstrating the continued value of interpretable components like duration prediction in adapting advanced generative architectures to low-resource, multilingual settings.

Abstract: High-quality speech generation for low-resource languages, such as many
Indian languages, remains a significant challenge due to limited data and
diverse linguistic structures. Duration prediction is a critical component in
many speech generation pipelines, playing a key role in modeling prosody and
speech rhythm. While some recent generative approaches choose to omit explicit
duration modeling, often at the cost of longer training times. We retain and
explore this module to better understand its impact in the linguistically rich
and data-scarce landscape of India. We train a non-autoregressive Continuous
Normalizing Flow (CNF) based speech model using publicly available Indian
language data and evaluate multiple duration prediction strategies for
zero-shot, speaker-specific generation. Our comparative analysis on
speech-infilling tasks reveals nuanced trade-offs: infilling based predictors
improve intelligibility in some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors
better preserve speaker characteristics in others. These findings inform the
design and selection of duration strategies tailored to specific languages and
tasks, underscoring the continued value of interpretable components like

### [253] [Clustering-based hard negative sampling for supervised contrastive speaker verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17540)
*Piotr Masztalski,Michał Romaniuk,Jakub Żak,Mateusz Matuszewski,Konrad Kowalczyk*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes CHNS, a clustering-based hard negative sampling method for supervised contrastive learning in speaker verification that clusters similar speaker embeddings and optimizes batch composition to improve verification performance by up to 18% relative improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker verification traditionally relies on classification-based approaches, but contrastive learning is emerging as a promising alternative. However, effective use of hard negative pairs (similar-sounding speakers from different classes) remains challenging. Existing methods don't optimally balance hard and easy negatives during training, limiting the potential of contrastive learning for speaker verification.

Method: The paper introduces CHNS (Clustering-based Hard Negative Sampling), which clusters embeddings of similar speakers and strategically adjusts batch composition during training. The method calculates an optimal ratio of hard negatives (challenging similar speakers) to easy negatives during contrastive loss computation, ensuring more effective supervised contrastive learning for speaker representation.

Result: CHNS achieves up to 18% relative improvement in Equal Error Rate (EER) and minimum Detection Cost Function (minDCF) on the VoxCeleb dataset compared to baseline supervised contrastive approaches and state-of-the-art classification-based methods. The improvements were demonstrated using two lightweight model architectures, showing consistent performance gains.

Conclusion: The clustering-based hard negative sampling approach effectively enhances supervised contrastive learning for speaker verification by intelligently managing the difficulty balance in training pairs. CHNS demonstrates superior performance over both traditional classification-based methods and existing contrastive approaches, making it a promising technique for improving speaker verification systems.

Abstract: In speaker verification, contrastive learning is gaining popularity as an
alternative to the traditionally used classification-based approaches.
Contrastive methods can benefit from an effective use of hard negative pairs,
which are different-class samples particularly challenging for a verification
model due to their similarity. In this paper, we propose CHNS - a
clustering-based hard negative sampling method, dedicated for supervised
contrastive speaker representation learning. Our approach clusters embeddings
of similar speakers, and adjusts batch composition to obtain an optimal ratio
of hard and easy negatives during contrastive loss calculation. Experimental
evaluation shows that CHNS outperforms a baseline supervised contrastive
approach with and without loss-based hard negative sampling, as well as a
state-of-the-art classification-based approach to speaker verification by as
much as 18 % relative EER and minDCF on the VoxCeleb dataset using two
lightweight model architectures.

TL;DR: OkadaTorch is a PyTorch implementation of the Okada model that enables automatic differentiation for computing gradients and Hessians, making it suitable for fault parameter inversion and scientific machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a differentiable version of the widely used Okada model to enable gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference, and integration with scientific machine learning models for fault parameter inversion problems.

Method: Direct translation of the original Okada model into PyTorch with automatic differentiation capabilities, plus a wrapper interface for efficiently computing gradients and Hessians with respect to observation station coordinates or fault parameters.

Result: A fully differentiable PyTorch implementation of the Okada model that can compute gradients and Hessians automatically, enabling efficient fault parameter inversion workflows.

Conclusion: OkadaTorch provides a differentiable framework for the Okada model that facilitates gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference, and scientific machine learning applications in geophysics and fault parameter estimation.

Abstract: The Okada model is a widely used analytical solution for displacements and
strains caused by a point or rectangular dislocation source in a 3D elastic
half-space. We present OkadaTorch, a PyTorch implementation of the Okada model,

a convenient wrapper interface for efficiently computing gradients and Hessians
with respect to either observation station coordinates or fault parameters.
This differentiable framework is well suited for fault parameter inversion,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies on UAV network security assume uniform UAV capabilities and overlook energy-security trade-offs. This work addresses the realistic scenario where diverse UAVs with different payloads and computation resources must collaborate to serve ground terminals while maintaining physical layer security against eavesdroppers under propulsion energy constraints.

Method: A hierarchical optimization framework with two layers: (1) Inner layer uses semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex programming for secrecy precoding with fixed UAV positions, (2) Outer layer employs Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization that incorporates expert heuristics without real-time LLM inference overhead.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in both secrecy rate and energy efficiency, showing consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework successfully addresses the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication in heterogeneous networks, achieving superior performance in secrecy rate maximization while maintaining energy efficiency and demonstrating robustness across different network configurations.

Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy
constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or
overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where
UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve
ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex
coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical
optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex
(d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV
positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided
heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for
trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics
policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware,
security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM
calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing
baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness
across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

*Kayhan Latifzadeh,Luis A. Leiva,Klen Čopič Pucihar,Matjaž Kljun,Iztok Devetak,Lili Steblovnik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study used eye and head tracking to assess clinical skills during simulated baby delivery training, showing that these measurements can effectively distinguish between trained and untrained practitioners with high accuracy (F1 scores up to 0.85).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods in clinical training rely heavily on subjective scores, creating a need for objective, computational approaches to assess practitioner skills during medical procedures like baby delivery.

Method: The researchers tracked eye and head movements of 24 practitioners during simulated baby delivery training sessions using eye-tracking glasses, measuring key metrics including pupillary response rate, fixation duration, and angular velocity to differentiate skill levels.

Result: Head-related features achieved superior performance with F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, while pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85, effectively distinguishing between trained and untrained practitioners during labor tasks.

Conclusion: Eye and head tracking using commodity eye-tracking glasses can serve as an effective complementary tool to traditional subjective evaluation methods, providing objective computational models for implicit skill assessment and training support in clinical settings.

Abstract: We examined eye and head movements to gain insights into skill development in
clinical settings. A total of 24 practitioners participated in simulated baby
delivery training sessions. We calculated key metrics, including pupillary
response rate, fixation duration, or angular velocity. Our findings indicate
that eye and head tracking can effectively differentiate between trained and
untrained practitioners, particularly during labor tasks. For example,
head-related features achieved an F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, whereas
pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85. The results
lay the groundwork for computational models that support implicit skill
assessment and training in clinical settings by using commodity eye-tracking
glasses as a complementary device to more traditional evaluation methods such
as subjective scores.

### [257] [HypoChainer: A Collaborative System Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Hypothesis-Driven Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17209)
*Haoran Jiang,Shaohan Shi,Yunjie Yao,Chang Jiang,Quan Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: HypoChainer is a collaborative visualization framework that combines human expertise, large language models, and knowledge graphs to enhance scientific hypothesis generation and validation, addressing the limitations of traditional research methods and AI-only approaches in biomedical discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hypothesis-driven research is limited by human cognitive constraints, biological system complexity, and high experimental costs. While deep learning models like GNNs accelerate prediction generation, the vast output volume makes manual validation unscalable. LLMs show promise but suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability in scientific discovery.

Method: HypoChainer operates through three stages: (1) Exploration and contextualization using retrieval-augmented LLMs and dimensionality reduction to navigate GNN predictions with interactive explanations; (2) Hypothesis chain formation through iterative examination of knowledge graph relationships with LLM and KG suggestions; (3) Validation prioritization by filtering hypotheses based on KG-supported evidence and using visual analytics to strengthen weak reasoning links.

Result: The framework's effectiveness was demonstrated through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, showing its capability to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery in biomedicine and drug development.

Conclusion: HypoChainer successfully integrates human expertise with AI capabilities to overcome the limitations of both traditional research methods and pure AI approaches, providing a practical solution for enhancing scientific hypothesis generation and validation in complex biomedical domains.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and
heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug
development. Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is
constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems,
and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models,
especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction
generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for
validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering
and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in
structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we
propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates
human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance
hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages:
First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented
LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN
predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain
formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions
and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG
suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are
filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates
for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in
reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in
two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support
interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.

*Xiaoan Liu,Difan Jia,Xianhao Carton Liu,Mar Gonzalez-Franco,Chen Zhu-Tian*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Reality Proxy is a Mixed Reality system that creates abstract representations (proxies) of real-world objects to overcome interaction difficulties when objects are crowded, distant, or occluded, enabling more sophisticated interactions without new gestures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interacting with real-world objects in Mixed Reality is challenging when objects are crowded, distant, or partially occluded, making selection and manipulation difficult due to tight coupling between input and physical constraints of objects.

Method: The system decouples interaction from physical constraints by introducing proxies - abstract representations of real-world objects that users can interact with instead of the physical objects directly. AI is used to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical spatial relationships, enabling seamless shifting between physical objects and their proxies during selection.

Result: Reality Proxy enables novel MR interactions including skimming, attribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi-object selections without requiring new gestures or menu systems. The system demonstrated versatility across office information retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control scenarios.

Conclusion: Expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, indicating that proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction paradigm for future Mixed Reality systems, successfully addressing fundamental interaction challenges in MR environments.

Abstract: Interacting with real-world objects in Mixed Reality (MR) often proves
difficult when they are crowded, distant, or partially occluded, hindering
straightforward selection and manipulation. We observe that these difficulties
stem from performing interaction directly on physical objects, where input is
tightly coupled to their physical constraints. Our key insight is to decouple
interaction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract
representations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy,
a system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to
their proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality
Proxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical
spatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel
and previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,
attribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object
selections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate
Reality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office
information retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.
An expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting
that proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction
paradigm for future MR systems.

### [259] [Explainable AI for Collaborative Assessment of 2D/3D Registration Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17597)
*Sue Min Cho,Alexander Do,Russell H. Taylor,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an explainable AI framework to help human operators verify the quality of 2D/3D registration in surgical navigation systems, addressing the critical need for reliable quality assurance when current visualization methods are insufficient for detecting registration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgery is undergoing digital transformation with advanced imaging and robotics, creating new operator roles that must verify complex algorithmic outputs at critical procedure points. Current visualization-based methods are insufficient for humans to reliably detect 2D/3D registration misalignments, which can lead to revision surgery or irreversible errors, necessitating robust quality assurance solutions.

Method: The researchers developed the first AI framework specifically trained for 2D/3D registration quality verification, enhanced with explainability features to clarify the model's decision-making process. They conducted systematic evaluations comparing four conditions: AI-only, human-only, human-AI, and human-XAI through both algorithm-centric and human-centered assessments.

Result: The explainability features modestly improved user trust and willingness to override AI errors, but did not exceed the performance of standalone AI in aggregate performance metrics. The study provided insights into how explainable AI affects human-AI collaboration in surgical quality assurance tasks.

Conclusion: While the current explainable AI approach shows promise for enhancing human decision-making in surgical registration verification, it does not significantly outperform standalone AI. Future work should focus on extending both algorithmic design and human-XAI collaboration elements to achieve more robust quality assurance for 2D/3D registration in surgical applications.

Abstract: As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated
imaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex
sub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for
patient safety. This shift introduces new "operator-type" roles tasked with
verifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of
the procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant
placement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based
surgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D
data. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they
occasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can
lead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical
need for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone
have been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D
registration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial
intelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality
verification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's
decision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed
decision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with
a rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered
evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,
human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features
modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not
exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work
extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements
holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.

*Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,David creswell,Jordan Albert,Patrick O'Connell,Shawn Fallon,Mathew Polowitz,Xuhai "orson" Xu,Bashima islam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper develops a smartphone accelerometer-based system that tracks breathing patterns and estimates mindfulness skills (concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity) to enhance digital meditation apps, achieving high accuracy in respiration tracking (1.6 BPM error) and skill estimation (80-84% F1 scores).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While mindfulness apps are widely accessible, sustaining long-term user engagement remains challenging. The research is motivated by the need to enhance digital mindfulness training through objective feedback mechanisms that can improve system usability and skill development without requiring additional wearable devices.

Method: The researchers developed a smartphone accelerometer-based respiration tracking algorithm specifically designed to capture slow breathing patterns typical of mindfulness meditation. They also created the first quantitative framework to estimate three mindfulness skills (concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity) based on accelerometer-derived respiration data. The system was tested on 261 mindfulness sessions in both controlled and real-world settings.

Result: The respiration tracking model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute compared to ground truth data. The mindfulness skill estimation framework attained F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. A user study comparing groups with and without biosignal feedback demonstrated that respiration feedback enhances system usability.

Conclusion: The integration of respiration tracking and mindfulness skill estimation into smartphone apps demonstrates the potential of using built-in smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness training. The system successfully provides objective feedback without requiring additional wearables, potentially improving long-term user engagement in mindfulness practices.

Abstract: Mindfulness training is widely recognized for its benefits in reducing
depression, anxiety, and loneliness. With the rise of smartphone-based
mindfulness apps, digital meditation has become more accessible, but sustaining
long-term user engagement remains a challenge. This paper explores whether
respiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation enhance system
usability and skill development. We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based
respiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.
Unlike existing methods, our approach accurately captures slow breathing
patterns typical of mindfulness meditation. Additionally, we introduce the
first quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills-concentration,
sensory clarity, and equanimity-based on accelerometer-derived respiration
data. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both
controlled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental
group receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app
shows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration
tracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute,
closely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation
attains F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. By integrating
respiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we
demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness
training.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: StreamME is a fast 3D avatar reconstruction method that synchronously records and reconstructs head avatars from live video streams using on-the-fly training with 3D Gaussian Splatting, eliminating the need for pre-cached data or MLPs while maintaining high rendering quality through a sparse point cloud distribution strategy.

Motivation: The need for fast 3D avatar reconstruction from live video streams without pre-cached data for seamless integration into downstream applications, while protecting facial privacy and reducing communication bandwidth in VR systems and online conferences.

Method: Built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with elimination of MLPs in deformable 3DGS, relying solely on geometry for faster facial expression adaptation. Introduces a simplification strategy based on primary points that distributes point clouds sparsely across facial surfaces to optimize point numbers while maintaining rendering quality.

Conclusion: StreamME successfully demonstrates fast 3D avatar reconstruction through on-the-fly training, offering practical benefits for privacy protection, bandwidth reduction, and direct application to various downstream tasks in VR and online conference systems.

Abstract: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our

### [262] [GhostUMAP2: Measuring and Analyzing (r,d)-Stability of UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17174)
*Myeongwon Jung,Takanori Fujiwara,Jaemin Jo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces (r,d)-stability framework to analyze and address the instability issues in UMAP's stochastic optimization process, using "ghosts" (duplicated data points) to measure how stochastic elements affect projection stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP's stochastic optimization process produces unstable results where data point projections are determined by chance rather than reflecting true neighboring structures, but this impact remains underexplored in the literature.

Method: The authors introduce (r,d)-stability framework that uses "ghosts" (duplicates of data points) to represent potential positional variations due to stochasticity. A data point is (r,d)-stable if ghosts perturbed within radius r in initial projection remain within radius d in final positions. They develop an adaptive dropping scheme for efficient computation and create a visualization tool for interactive exploration.

Result: The adaptive dropping scheme reduces runtime by up to 60% compared to unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable points. The framework successfully demonstrates effectiveness on real-world datasets and provides practical usage guidelines.

Conclusion: The (r,d)-stability framework provides an effective way to analyze and understand UMAP's stochastic behavior, offering both computational efficiency improvements and practical tools for assessing projection stability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP), the impact of its stochastic optimization process on the results
remains underexplored. We observed that it often produces unstable results
where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather
than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we
introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic
positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic
elements, specifically initial projection positions and negative sampling,
impact UMAP results, we introduce "ghosts", or duplicates of data points
representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a
data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle
of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius
d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we
develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared
to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable
points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive
exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of
real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our
framework.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews controllable video generation methods that extend beyond text-to-video generation by incorporating additional non-textual conditions like camera motion, depth maps, and human pose to enable more precise user control over AI-generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text prompts alone are insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements for video generation. Current foundation models struggle to provide precise control, making it challenging for users to generate videos that accurately reflect their intent using text-only inputs.

Method: The paper provides a systematic survey approach covering: (1) introduction of key concepts and open-source video generation models, (2) analysis of control mechanisms in video diffusion models and how different conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process, and (3) categorization of existing methods based on control signal types including single-condition, multi-condition, and universal controllable generation.

Result: The survey presents a comprehensive categorization and analysis of controllable video generation methods, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances. It systematically organizes existing approaches based on the types of control signals they leverage and provides a curated repository of literature on the topic.

Conclusion: The integration of additional non-textual conditions (camera motion, depth maps, human pose) into pretrained video generation models successfully enhances flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems, enabling more controllable video synthesis that better reflects user intent.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation
has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular,
the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand
for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user
intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video
generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,
multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it
challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current
models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of
additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human
pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable
video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical
applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both
theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by
introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation
models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,
analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the
denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods
based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition
generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

### [264] [A Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16826)
*Qikai Wei,Huansheng Ning,Chunlong Han,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes QMKGF, a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion approach that enhances Retrieval Augmented Generation by constructing knowledge graphs from retrieved documents and using multi-path subgraph strategies with query-aware attention to improve semantic relevance and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching while overlooking intrinsic connections between them, which hampers performance in RAG tasks that require understanding relationships and context.

Method: The approach involves: (1) using LLMs with prompt templates to extract entities and relations to build knowledge graphs, (2) implementing multi-path subgraph construction with one-hop, multi-hop, and importance-based relations, (3) applying a query-aware attention reward model to score subgraph triples, (4) selecting and enriching the highest-scoring subgraph, and (5) using the enhanced subgraph to expand the original query for better semantic representation.

Result: QMKGF was evaluated on SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On HotpotQA, it achieved a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98%, surpassing the BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26% to 64.98%), demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF approach in enhancing RAG performance by leveraging knowledge graph structures and query-aware attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships between retrieved documents.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising
paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content
generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies
primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching
methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This
limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,
a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing
Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ
general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a
knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a
multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,
multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the
semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.
Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores
subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we
select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples
from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.
Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are
utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic
representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF
on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA
dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the
BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%).
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF
approach.

*Giovanni De Toni,Erasmo Purificato,Emilia Gómez,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini,Cristian Consonni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper presents a conformal risk control method to provably reduce unwanted content in recommender systems using simple binary user feedback, while maintaining recommendation set size through implicit feedback signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems face criticism for propagating harmful, irrelevant, and unwanted content that degrades user satisfaction and contributes to societal issues like misinformation and radicalization. Existing platform mechanisms are insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to user feedback.

Method: An intuitive, model-agnostic, and distribution-free approach using conformal risk control that leverages simple binary feedback on items to bound unwanted content. The method also uses implicit feedback on consumed items to expand recommendation sets while maintaining robust risk mitigation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on data from a popular online video-sharing platform demonstrates effective and controllable reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal user effort, while addressing the limitation of smaller recommendation sets in traditional conformal risk control.

Conclusion: The proposed conformal risk control method provides a practical solution for mitigating harmful content in recommender systems with provable guarantees, offering better control over unwanted recommendations while maintaining usability through expanded recommendation sets.

Abstract: Recommenders are significantly shaping online information consumption. While
effective at personalizing content, these systems increasingly face criticism
for propagating irrelevant, unwanted, and even harmful recommendations. Such
content degrades user satisfaction and contributes to significant societal
issues, including misinformation, radicalization, and erosion of user trust.
Although platforms offer mechanisms to mitigate exposure to undesired content,
these mechanisms are often insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to users'
feedback. This paper introduces an intuitive, model-agnostic, and
distribution-free method that uses conformal risk control to provably bound
unwanted content in personalized recommendations by leveraging simple binary
feedback on items. We also address a limitation of traditional conformal risk
control approaches, i.e., the fact that the recommender can provide a smaller
set of recommended items, by leveraging implicit feedback on consumed items to
expand the recommendation set while ensuring robust risk mitigation. Our
experimental evaluation on data coming from a popular online video-sharing
platform demonstrates that our approach ensures an effective and controllable
reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal effort. The source code is

### [266] [VL-CLIP: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations via Visual Grounding and LLM-Augmented CLIP Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17080)
*Ramin Giahi,Kehui Yao,Sriram Kollipara,Kai Zhao,Vahid Mirjalili,Jianpeng Xu,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes VL-CLIP, an enhanced CLIP framework that integrates Visual Grounding and LLM-based text enhancement to improve multimodal e-commerce recommendations, achieving significant improvements in CTR (18.6%), ATC (15.5%), and GMV (4.0%) on a major U.S. e-commerce platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models like CLIP face three key challenges in e-commerce: 1) weak object-level alignment where global embeddings miss fine-grained product attributes, 2) ambiguous textual representations due to unclear product descriptions, and 3) domain mismatch as generic models don't generalize well to e-commerce-specific data.

Method: VL-CLIP enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating two components: Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding that localizes key products in images, and an LLM-based agent that generates enriched text embeddings by disambiguating product descriptions to improve cross-modal matching.

Result: The framework significantly improves performance on a major U.S. e-commerce platform with tens of millions of items, achieving 18.6% increase in CTR, 15.5% increase in ATC, and 4.0% increase in GMV. It outperforms existing vision-language models including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL in both precision and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: The combination of object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation demonstrates strong potential for robust multimodal recommendations, effectively addressing the limitations of existing vision-language models in e-commerce applications and delivering substantial business impact.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.

*Conor McNamara,Effirul Ramlan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Deep CCA-based citation recommendation algorithm that uses neural networks to capture non-linear relationships between textual and graph-based representations of scientific articles, achieving significant improvements over linear CCA methods on the DBLP dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing citation recommendation methods using linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have limitations in capturing complex, non-linear relationships between multiple data modalities (textual and graph-based representations) in scholarly documents, which limits their effectiveness in combining complementary information from different views.

Method: The authors propose a Deep CCA (DCCA) approach that extends linear CCA with neural networks to learn non-linear transformations and capture complex relationships between distributed textual and graph-based representations of scientific articles for citation recommendation.

Result: Experiments on the DBLP citation network dataset show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CCA-based methods with relative improvements of over 11% in Mean Average Precision@10, 5% in Precision@10, and 7% in Recall@10, demonstrating more relevant citation recommendations and enhanced ranking quality.

Conclusion: Deep CCA's non-linear transformations yield more expressive latent representations compared to linear CCA projections, leading to improved citation recommendation performance by better capturing complementary information from multiple data modalities while preserving unique characteristics of each modality.

Abstract: Recent advances in citation recommendation have improved accuracy by
leveraging multi-view representation learning to integrate the various
modalities present in scholarly documents. However, effectively combining
multiple data views requires fusion techniques that can capture complementary
information while preserving the unique characteristics of each modality. We
propose a novel citation recommendation algorithm that improves upon linear
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods by applying Deep CCA (DCCA), a
neural network extension capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships
between distributed textual and graph-based representations of scientific
articles. Experiments on the large-scale DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library
Project) citation network dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art CCA-based methods, achieving relative improvements of over 11%
in Mean Average Precision@10, 5% in Precision@10, and 7% in Recall@10. These
gains reflect more relevant citation recommendations and enhanced ranking
quality, suggesting that DCCA's non-linear transformations yield more
expressive latent representations than CCA's linear projections.

*Die Hu,Shuyue Hu,Chunjiang Mu,Shiqi Fan,Chen Chu,Jinzhuo Liu,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how heterogeneous multi-agent systems with diverse initial policies converge to unified behavior through smooth regret-matching, showing that regret variance diminishes over time leading to consensus and quantal response equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting behavior of large-scale multi-agent systems remains a fundamental challenge. The paper aims to examine how heterogeneity affects equilibrium formation and how diverse agents with different initial policies can achieve unified behavior.

Method: The authors model the system state as a probability distribution of regrets and analyze its evolution using the continuity equation. They study smooth regret-matching dynamics in large populations of heterogeneous agents to understand convergence patterns.

Result: The key finding is that the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, causing heterogeneity to disappear and consensus to emerge among agents. This universal result enables proof of convergence to quantal response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative settings.

Conclusion: The work advances theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning by providing a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic scenarios, demonstrating how heterogeneous systems naturally converge to unified behavior through regret-based learning dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in
games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper
examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how
smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with
diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state
as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through
the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent
settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading
to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among
agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal
response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings.
Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and

*April Herwig,Matthew J. Colbrook,Oliver Junge,Péter Koltai,Julia Slipantschuk*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper presents algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators without spectral pollution, extending beyond previous Koopman operator methods to provide robust spectral estimation tools for nonlinear dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer operators suffer from spectral pollution, which introduces spurious eigenvalues that compromise spectral computations. While provably convergent methods exist for Koopman operators, analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited, creating a need for pollution-free spectral computation methods.

Method: The authors develop algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space. The methods address the functional-analytic challenges in defining the "true" Koopman spectrum and handle cases where eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen function space.

Result: Case studies demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the approach, ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to molecular dynamics models of protein folding. The methods successfully identify spectral features even when corresponding eigenfunctions exist outside the chosen space, revealing important functional-analytic subtleties.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad range of applications, offering pollution-free alternatives for transfer operator spectral analysis and advancing the theoretical understanding of Koopman spectrum definition in function spaces.

Abstract: Koopman operator theory enables linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical
systems by lifting their evolution to infinite-dimensional function spaces.
However, finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer
(Frobenius--Perron) operators are prone to spectral pollution, introducing
spurious eigenvalues that can compromise spectral computations. While recent
advances have yielded provably convergent methods for Koopman operators,
analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited. In this paper,
we present algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators
without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space.
Case studies--ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to a
molecular dynamics model of protein folding--demonstrate the accuracy and
flexibility of our approach. Notably, we demonstrate that spectral features can
arise even when the corresponding eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen space,
highlighting the functional-analytic subtleties in defining the "true" Koopman
spectrum. Our methods offer robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad
range of applications.

*Feng Cao,Zishuo Feng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HuiduRep is a self-supervised representation learning framework that improves spike sorting in extracellular neural recordings by combining contrastive learning with denoising autoencoders to create robust features that handle noise, drift, and cross-session variability better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike sorting, which assigns neural spikes to their source neurons, remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio, electrode drift, and cross-session variability. Current methods struggle with these conditions, limiting the reliability of single-neuron resolution brain activity decoding in neuroscience applications.

Method: The authors propose HuiduRep, a self-supervised representation learning framework that combines contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder. This approach extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms, learning latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. They then build an unsupervised spike sorting pipeline that clusters these spike representations.

Result: Experiments on both hybrid and real-world datasets show that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness to challenging conditions. The complete pipeline matches or outperforms state-of-the-art spike sorting tools including KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 in terms of accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that self-supervised spike representation learning can serve as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings, offering significant improvements over existing spike sorting methods in challenging experimental conditions.

Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near
neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity
at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its
source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it
remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and
cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust
self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative
and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining
contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent
representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we
develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without
supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that
HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a
foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular

*Junlang Huang,Hao Chen,Zhong Guan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A neural framework for power and timing prediction in multi-stage data paths that uses pre-trained models to directly infer waveforms and delays from SPICE netlists, achieving SPICE-level accuracy with RMSE below 0.0098 across industrial circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional library-based analytical methods for power and timing prediction rely on driver characterization and load simplifications, which may not accurately capture complex circuit behaviors. There is a need for a more accurate, scalable approach that can handle intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplifications or interpolations.

Method: The approach uses two pre-trained neural models: one for waveform prediction and one for delay estimation that directly process SPICE netlists. It employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding to handle variable input dimensions. A recursive propagation strategy feeds predicted waveforms from each stage into subsequent stages. Specialized subnetworks handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction separately.

Result: The framework achieves SPICE-level accuracy with consistently low RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. It successfully captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects while providing precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways.

Conclusion: The proposed neural framework provides a scalable and structurally adaptable alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors. This represents the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells, offering superior accuracy compared to traditional analytical methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of
multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based
analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load
simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard
cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform
prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and
propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical
parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method
accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without
requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,
we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from
each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across
the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete
waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction
utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level
encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality
constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary
delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate
SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse
industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally
adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,
demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.

*Imad Bouhou,Stefano Fortunati,Leila Gharsalli,Alexandre Renaux*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A power-aware cognitive radar framework using Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in massive MIMO radar systems, with adaptive waveform design that allocates transmit energy based on predicted target positions and power requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uniform power allocation in radar systems is suboptimal when dealing with targets having varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). There is a need for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems that can intelligently allocate power resources to enhance detection of weaker targets while maintaining performance for high-SNR targets.

Method: Extended single-target POMCP algorithm to multi-target case by assigning independent POMCP trees to each target. The approach predicts future angular positions and expected received power based on estimated range and radar cross-section (RCS). Uses constrained optimization for adaptive waveform design and modifies the POMDP reward function to prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.

Result: Simulations with multiple targets at different SNRs showed improved detection probability for low-SNR targets and more accurate tracking performance compared to uniform or orthogonal waveform approaches. The framework demonstrated scalable and efficient planning capabilities for multi-target scenarios.

Conclusion: The POMCP-based cognitive radar framework successfully enables adaptive and efficient multi-target radar systems by intelligently allocating transmit energy based on target characteristics, demonstrating significant improvements in detection and tracking performance over conventional approaches.

Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for
joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target
algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend
it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,
enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with
varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's
future angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated
range and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform
design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to
enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring
sufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to
prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the
effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar
improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate
tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These
results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive,
efficient multi-target radar systems.

### [273] [Integrating Belief Domains into Probabilistic Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17291)
*Damiano Azzolini,Fabrizio Riguzzi,Theresa Swift*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper extends Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) with belief functions to handle epistemic uncertainty through interval probabilities, introducing Capacity Logic Programs that generalize the Distribution Semantics beyond point-probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PLP formulations using the Distribution Semantics rely on point-probabilities, which makes it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty that arises in practical applications like hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. There's a need to handle uncertainty more comprehensively in logic programming frameworks.

Method: The paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs by extending the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions. Belief functions are used as non-additive capacities that generalize probability measures and can represent epistemic uncertainty through interval probabilities rather than point probabilities.

Result: The paper develops a new framework called Capacity Logic Programs that can handle epistemic uncertainty through interval probabilities. The framework maintains properties that make it suitable for practical applications while extending beyond the limitations of point-probability approaches.

Conclusion: The extended framework successfully addresses the limitation of current PLP implementations by incorporating belief functions and interval probabilities, providing a more comprehensive approach to reasoning under uncertainty that can better handle epistemic uncertainty in practical applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a
leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the
Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or
Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely
ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution
Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic
uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications
from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures
as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval
probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs
based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief
functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable
to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: American options pricing in multiple dimensions is computationally challenging due to the free-boundary problem and curse of dimensionality. Traditional Monte Carlo methods are slow, motivating the need for faster neural network-based approaches that can handle up to five dimensions under different market models.

Method: The paper employs two neural network approaches: (1) Time Deep Gradient Flow (TDGF) method extended to handle free-boundary PDEs of American options, and (2) Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). Both methods are implemented with carefully designed sampling strategies during training and tested under BlackScholes and Heston models.

Result: Both TDGF and DGM achieve high accuracy in pricing multidimensional American put options while significantly outperforming conventional Monte Carlo methods in computational speed. TDGF demonstrates faster training times compared to DGM, making it particularly efficient for this application.

Conclusion: Neural network-based methods, particularly TDGF and DGM, provide effective solutions for pricing multidimensional American options, offering superior computational efficiency over traditional Monte Carlo approaches while maintaining high accuracy across different market models.

Abstract: In this research, we explore neural network-based methods for pricing
multidimensional American put options under the BlackScholes and Heston model,
extending up to five dimensions. We focus on two approaches: the Time Deep
Gradient Flow (TDGF) method and the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). We extend the
TDGF method to handle the free-boundary partial differential equation inherent
in American options. We carefully design the sampling strategy during training
to enhance performance. Both TDGF and DGM achieve high accuracy while
outperforming conventional Monte Carlo methods in terms of computational speed.
In particular, TDGF tends to be faster during training than DGM.

Motivation: Large datasets of atomic-resolution microscopic images create opportunities for machine learning to identify subtle physical phenomena. The need exists to automate calculation of magnetic moments and orientations in spin-ice configurations, and to correlate structural and functional aspects for optimized design.

Method: A two-stage workflow: (1) Train machine learning models to predict magnetic moments and directions in spin-ice structures using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic magnetic force microscopy images and extract latent features, reducing experimental errors; (2) Identify and predict frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments to correlate structure and function.

Result: The methodology successfully enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments in honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images.

Conclusion: The developed machine learning approach facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis of spin-ice materials with desired properties.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution
facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze
subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic
images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we
automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations
of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine
learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and
directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an
emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate
high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract
latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation
errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification
and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively
correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This
facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: BucketServe is a bucket-based dynamic batching framework that optimizes LLM inference by grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets, achieving up to 3.58x throughput improvement and 1.93x higher request load handling compared to existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems using static or continuous batching strategies suffer from inefficient GPU memory utilization, increased latency under heterogeneous workloads, poor adaptation to dynamic workload fluctuations, and potential SLO violations, creating a need for better batching approaches.

Method: BucketServe groups requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length to minimize padding overhead, implements real-time batch size adjustments to prevent OOM errors, and uses adaptive bucket splitting/merging with priority-aware scheduling to reduce resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance.

Result: BucketServe achieves up to 3.58x throughput improvement over UELLM, handles 1.93x more request load under 80% SLO attainment compared to DistServe, and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to UELLM.

Conclusion: BucketServe successfully addresses the limitations of existing LLM serving systems by providing a dynamic batching framework that significantly improves throughput, request handling capacity, and SLO compliance through intelligent bucket-based request grouping and adaptive resource management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various
areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to
LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or
latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing
LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which
can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency,
especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to
adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and
potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce
BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM
inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based
on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU
memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory
(OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and
priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO
compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM
in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more
request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and
demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.

TL;DR: ExplainVulD is a graph-based framework for detecting security vulnerabilities in C/C++ code that uses Code Property Graphs with dual-channel embeddings and edge-aware attention mechanisms, achieving 88.25% accuracy and 48.23% F1 score while providing explainable outputs for security workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security vulnerability detection in source code faces significant challenges due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented, existing methods optimize for recall leading to high false positive rates, and many approaches lack explainability which limits their integration into security workflows.

Method: The framework constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information, processes these through an edge-aware attention mechanism with edge-type embeddings to distinguish program relations, and addresses class imbalance using class-weighted cross-entropy loss during training.

Result: ExplainVulD achieves 88.25% mean accuracy and 48.23% F1 score across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset, showing relative improvements of 4.6% in accuracy and 16.9% in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, and outperforms static analysis tools with 14.0-14.1% accuracy gains and 132.2-201.2% F1 score improvements.

Conclusion: ExplainVulD successfully addresses key challenges in vulnerability detection by improving both detection performance and providing explainable outputs that identify the most influential code regions within functions, supporting transparency and trust in security triage workflows.

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging,
particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable
functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise
for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in
development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability,
limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents
ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code.
The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using
dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information.
These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates
edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class
imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss.
ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23
percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results
represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in

framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0
to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond
improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for smart Ponzi scheme detection require large amounts of labeled data which is often scarce, hindering effective model training and increasing operational costs in blockchain fraud detection.

Method: CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER) uses contrastive learning techniques to learn effective representations of smart contract source code from unlabeled datasets, reducing dependency on labeled data for training.

Result: CASPER outperforms baselines by 2.3% F1 score with 100% labeled data, and achieves nearly 20% higher F1 score with only 25% labeled data on the XBlock dataset, demonstrating significant performance gains with reduced data requirements.

Conclusion: CASPER demonstrates potential for effective and cost-efficient detection of smart Ponzi schemes, offering a scalable fraud detection solution that reduces both operational costs and system complexity in blockchain security.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital currency trading, fueled by the integration of

investors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning
typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of
labeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model
training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning
framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more
negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in
blockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER
can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using
unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system
complexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the
baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More
impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly
20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These
results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection
of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions
in the future.

### [280] [SynthCTI: LLM-Driven Synthetic CTI Generation to enhance MITRE Technique Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16852)
*Álvaro Ruiz-Ródenas,Jaime Pujante Sáez,Daniel García-Algora,Mario Rodríguez Béjar,Jorge Blasco,José Luis Hernández-Ramos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynthCTI is a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic CTI sentences to improve automated mapping of threat descriptions to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, achieving significant performance gains (up to 48.6% relative improvement) by addressing data scarcity and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated mapping of cyber threat descriptions to MITRE ATT&CK techniques faces major challenges including scarcity of high-quality labeled CTI data and severe class imbalance where many techniques have very few training examples, while current approaches focus mainly on model architecture rather than addressing these fundamental data limitations.

Method: SynthCTI uses a clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and guides an LLM to generate synthetic CTI sentences that are both lexically diverse and semantically faithful to underrepresented MITRE ATT&CK techniques, specifically targeting data augmentation for minority classes.

Result: Evaluation on CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM datasets shows consistent macro-F1 improvements across different LLMs: ALBERT improved from 0.35 to 0.52 (48.6% relative gain), SecureBERT reached 0.6558 (up from 0.4412), and smaller models with SynthCTI outperformed larger models without augmentation.

Conclusion: SynthCTI effectively addresses data scarcity and class imbalance in CTI classification by generating high-quality synthetic training data, demonstrating that data augmentation methods can be more valuable than simply scaling model size for building efficient CTI classification systems.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining involves extracting structured
insights from unstructured threat data, enabling organizations to understand
and respond to evolving adversarial behavior. A key task in CTI mining is
mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. However, this process
is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort.
Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality
labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few
examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT
have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture
rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI,
a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI
sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. Our method uses a
clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and
guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse
and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI
datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity.
Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for
example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\%), and
SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412). Notably, smaller models augmented
with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation,
demonstrating the value of data generation methods for building efficient and
effective CTI classification systems.

### [281] [Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259)
*Eyal German,Sagiv Antebi,Daniel Samira,Asaf Shabtai,Yuval Elovici*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models trained with tabular data, revealing that LLMs memorize structured data differently across encoding formats and are highly vulnerable to privacy attacks even with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly trained on tabular data containing personally identifiable information (PII) in structured formats, creating privacy risks through data extraction and membership inference attacks. Existing MIA methods focus on textual content, but their effectiveness on structured data with limited content, diverse data types, and column-level semantics remains unclear.

Method: The authors developed Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset comprising five data collections each represented in six different encoding formats. They conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs fine-tuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats, analyzing memorization behavior on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.

Result: LLMs memorize tabular data differently across encoding formats and are highly susceptible to membership inference attacks. Even with minimal fine-tuning (as few as three epochs), models show high vulnerability with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. The memorization patterns vary significantly depending on how the tabular data is encoded.

Conclusion: Tab-MIA provides a systematic framework for evaluating privacy risks in LLMs trained on tabular data and establishes a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods. The benchmark demonstrates that current LLMs pose significant privacy threats when handling structured data, highlighting the urgent need for better privacy protection mechanisms in tabular data processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which,
unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information
(PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks
arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and
exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While
existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and
threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its
limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and
column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset
for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used.
Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different
encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation
of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across
multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization
behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.
Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across
encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when
fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with
AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic
evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing
privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.

### [282] [CompLeak: Deep Learning Model Compression Exacerbates Privacy Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16872)
*Na Li,Yansong Gao,Hongsheng Hu,Boyu Kuang,Anmin Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CompLeak, the first framework to evaluate privacy risks in compressed deep learning models through membership inference attacks, revealing that model compression techniques like pruning, quantization, and weight clustering can increase privacy vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While model compression is essential for reducing memory and accelerating inference in deep learning models including LLMs, the privacy risks introduced by compression operations have been overlooked and are poorly understood, creating a gap in security evaluation for compressed models.

Method: The authors propose CompLeak, a privacy risk evaluation framework with three variants: CompLeakNR (attacks single compressed models), CompLeakSR (leverages both original and compressed models as references), and CompLeakMR (exploits multiple compressed versions). The framework examines pruning, quantization, and weight clustering using membership inference attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven model architectures (ResNet to BERT/GPT-2) and six datasets show that compressed models exhibit different privacy leakage patterns for members vs non-members, and that combining information from multiple compressed versions significantly amplifies overall privacy leakage compared to attacking individual models.

Conclusion: Model compression introduces previously unrecognized privacy vulnerabilities that can be exploited through membership inference attacks, with privacy risks increasing when multiple compressed versions are available, highlighting the need for privacy-aware compression strategies.

Abstract: Model compression is crucial for minimizing memory storage and accelerating
inference in deep learning (DL) models, including recent foundation models like
large language models (LLMs). Users can access different compressed model
versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing
compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between
resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by
compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.
  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we
propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three
widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and
weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of
Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has
three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and
original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a
single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models
influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one
compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a
reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta
information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple
compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model,
CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed
versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct
extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to
foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark
datasets.

### [283] [Revisiting Pre-trained Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887)
*Youpeng Li,Weiliang Qi,Xuyu Wang,Fuxun Yu,Xinda Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents RevisitVD, a comprehensive evaluation of 17 pre-trained language models (PLMs) for vulnerability detection, revealing that code-specific PLMs with syntactic/semantic pre-training outperform general models, but all face significant challenges in real-world scenarios including complex dependencies, code transformations, and context window limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empirical studies of PLMs for vulnerability detection have inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings, undermining the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. There is a critical need to assess PLMs' effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities more thoroughly.

Method: The authors conducted an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs (both smaller code-specific and large-scale models) using newly constructed datasets. They compared performance under fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches, assessed effectiveness across various training/testing settings, and analyzed robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.

Result: PLMs with pre-training tasks designed to capture syntactic and semantic code patterns outperformed general-purpose PLMs and those only pre-trained on large code corpora. However, all models struggled with complex dependency vulnerabilities, code perturbations from normalization/abstraction, semantic-preserving vulnerable transformations, and labeling errors from context window truncation.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluations in practical scenarios and identifies key limitations of current PLMs for vulnerability detection. It outlines future research directions needed to enhance PLM effectiveness for realistic vulnerability detection applications, particularly addressing challenges with complex dependencies, code transformations, and context limitations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated
promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness
in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the
security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for
vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data
preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the
accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD,
an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and
large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the
performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their
effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing
settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction,
and semantic-preserving transformations.
  Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks
designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both
general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code
corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios,
such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies,
handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and
identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the
truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a
non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance
of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and
outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for
realistic VD applications.

### [284] [Evaluating Ensemble and Deep Learning Models for Static Malware Detection with Dimensionality Reduction Using the EMBER Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16952)
*Md Min-Ha-Zul Abedin,Tazqia Mehrub*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study compares eight machine learning algorithms (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, KNN, and TabNet) for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset under three preprocessing conditions (original, PCA, LDA), finding that ensemble boosting methods like LightGBM and XGBoost perform best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and benchmark different machine learning algorithms and preprocessing strategies for static malware detection, addressing the need for reliable classification models in cybersecurity applications and providing guidance for real-world deployment.

Method: Evaluated eight classification models under three preprocessing settings (original features, PCA, LDA) using the EMBER dataset of PE files. Performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC metrics. Conducted exploratory data analysis including mutual information ranking, PCA/t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and LOF.

Result: Ensemble boosting methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) showed best overall performance with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improved KNN performance but reduced accuracy for boosting models. TabNet underperformed under feature reduction due to architectural sensitivity. Dimensionality reduction effects varied significantly by model type.

Conclusion: Boosting models remain the most reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection. Dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type. The study provides a comprehensive benchmark for comparing classification models and preprocessing strategies in malware detection, offering practical insights for future system development and deployment.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning
algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains
feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight
classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees,
HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three
preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on
accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive
performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost,
show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal
sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance
but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising
in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural
sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed
exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or
t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local
Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features
in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most
reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that
dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type.
This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and
preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights
that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that integrates Digital Twins (DTs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) and penetration testing tools to enhance cybersecurity education, featuring the Red Team Knife (RTK) toolkit that simulates realistic cyber environments for hands-on training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cybersecurity education lacks practical, real-world experience and struggles to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and actual application. There's a need for more effective training methods that can simulate complex IT/OT/IoT infrastructures and provide interactive learning environments for cybersecurity professionals.

Method: The research develops a combined framework integrating Digital Twins with Large Language Models and penetration testing tools.

can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating
realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive
framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core
of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing
toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide
learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance,

*Minsoo Kim,Jip Kim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates optimal transmission switching (OTS) problems by predicting line states and using a differentiable DC-OPF layer, achieving feasible solutions in the same time as solving DCOPF while maintaining economic advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation creates significant computational complexity that becomes intractable on large grids, especially when using conventional mixed-integer solvers.

Method: The authors develop a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer. The method uses generation cost as the loss function to enforce physical network constraints during training and inference, and employs customized weight-bias initialization to maintain feasibility from the first iteration.

Result: DA-DNN produces provably feasible topology and dispatch pairs in the same time as solving DCOPF, while conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable on large grids. The method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed DA-DNN method effectively addresses the computational complexity of OTS problems by providing a scalable solution that maintains both feasibility guarantees and economic benefits, making it practical for large-scale power grid optimization.

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by
selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation
increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with
this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates
DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and
passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting
generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints
are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a
customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible
from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once
trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch
pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer
solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully
captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.

*Leandro Von Krannichfeldt,Kristina Orehounig,Olga Fink*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study evaluates five hybrid approaches that combine physics-based and data-driven methods for probabilistic building energy modeling, finding that residual learning with feedforward neural networks performs best and produces physically intuitive predictions for out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two significant research gaps exist in building energy modeling: (1) most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling while neglecting inherent uncertainties from weather fluctuations and occupant behavior, and (2) there has been little systematic comparison within a probabilistic modeling framework.

Method: The study evaluates five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a real-world case study. The approaches include learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs, and integrating physics-based output into loss functions.

Result: Two main findings emerged: (1) hybrid approach performance varies across different building room types, with residual learning using Feedforward Neural Networks performing best on average and being the only model producing physically intuitive predictions for out-of-distribution test data, and (2) Quantile Conformal Prediction effectively calibrates quantile predictions for indoor temperature modeling.

Conclusion: Residual learning with Feedforward Neural Networks is the most effective hybrid approach for probabilistic building energy modeling, particularly for handling out-of-distribution scenarios, and Quantile Conformal Prediction provides effective calibration for uncertainty quantification in indoor temperature predictions.

Abstract: Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of
building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been
explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely
data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths
of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as
learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between
simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world
measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven
models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the
data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.
First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting
the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and
occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a
probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating
five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy
modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a
real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the
performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types,
but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on
average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces
physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data.
Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating
quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of disaster informatics literature from 2020-2022, using advanced AI techniques to identify research trends, collaboration patterns, and the significant impact of COVID-19 on shifting research priorities toward public health and multidimensional resilience strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolving landscape of disaster informatics research during a critical period (2020-2022) that was heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify collaboration patterns, research trends, and shifts in priorities to provide strategic insights for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities.

Method: Bibliometric and topic analysis using a large-scale corpus of disaster informatics literature, employing advanced techniques including pre-trained language models and generative AI for data collection, quality assurance, topic extraction, summarization, and result visualization.

Result: Key findings include: (1) COVID-19 most-impacted countries were research leaders with specialized interests, (2) regional and linguistic proximity drives collaboration, (3) top authors form close partnerships while institutions have diverse research portfolios, (4) authors specialize in 1-2 topics while institutions span multiple areas, and (5) COVID-19 shifted research focus toward public health within disaster informatics.

Conclusion: The disaster informatics field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations, reflecting increased awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. The analysis provides strategic insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars to enhance disaster informatics capacities in an uncertain risk landscape.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the
disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September
2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as
pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active
countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics,
patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities
spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that
were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active,
with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and
institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to
collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or
two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific
topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics,
and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster
informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate
that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and
cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened
awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality
assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and
summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to
comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the
trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for
policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster
informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MADD, a multi-agent framework that simulates disinformation spread in social networks with both malicious and legitimate bots, enabling quantitative evaluation of different correction strategies in realistic network environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on disinformation spread rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook dynamic bot behavior, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. There's a need for more realistic frameworks to understand bot influence in human-bot information ecosystems for better risk control and governance.

Method: MADD framework integrates Barabasi Albert Model for scale-free topology and Stochastic Block Model for community structures to create realistic propagation networks. It designs node attributes based on real-world user data and incorporates both malicious and legitimate bots with controlled dynamic participation for quantitative analysis.

Result: The framework was evaluated using individual and group level metrics. Experiments verified real-world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure. Simulations of six disinformation topics demonstrated differential effects of fact-based and narrative-based correction strategies.

Conclusion: MADD provides a more realistic and comprehensive framework for studying disinformation dissemination that can quantitatively evaluate different correction strategies, offering insights into the differential effectiveness of fact-based versus narrative-based approaches in combating disinformation.

Abstract: In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles
in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is
essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies
often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic
behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To
fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for
Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation
network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and
the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node
attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both
malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation
allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD
using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real
world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we
simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the
differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media user behavior evolves over time influenced by demographic attributes and network formation. Understanding this evolution is crucial for addressing challenges like friend recommendations, activity predictions, and providing early warnings about potential negative outcomes to help users make informed decisions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses critical social media challenges such as friend recommendations and activity predictions. Cross-modal configurations prove superior for performance, and the research provides valuable insights into user behavior trajectories while offering potential for early warning systems to mitigate long-term risks.

Abstract: Social media platforms serve as a significant medium for sharing personal
emotions, daily activities, and various life events, ensuring individuals stay
informed about the latest developments. From the initiation of an account,
users progressively expand their circle of friends or followers, engaging
actively by posting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior
on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the
networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages
open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through
prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint
embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on
social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of
these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including
network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities.
Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2
achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration,
outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of
leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach
addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations
and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user
behavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research
aims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling
users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term.

### [292] [Weak Links in LinkedIn: Enhancing Fake Profile Detection in the Age of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16860)
*Apoorva Gulati,Rajesh Kumar,Vinti Agarwal,Aditya Sharma*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study reveals that existing fake profile detectors fail against LLM-generated profiles (42-52% false accept rate vs 6-7% for manual fakes) and proposes GPT-assisted adversarial training to restore detection effectiveness to 1-7% false accept rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have made it easier to create realistic fake profiles on platforms like LinkedIn, posing significant risks to existing text-based fake profile detection systems that were designed for manually created fake profiles.

Method: The researchers evaluated existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles and proposed GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure. They conducted ablation studies comparing different embedding approaches (combined numerical and textual, numerical-only, and textual-only) and performed complementary analysis using GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators.

Result: Existing detectors showed high false accept rates (42-52%) for GPT-generated profiles compared to manually created ones (6-7%). GPT-assisted adversarial training successfully reduced false accept rates to 1-7% while maintaining low false reject rates (0.5-2%). Combined numerical and textual embeddings showed highest robustness, followed by numerical-only, then textual-only embeddings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLM-generated fake profiles pose a serious threat to current detection systems, but GPT-assisted adversarial training can effectively counter this threat. The research affirms the critical need for robust automated detectors capable of handling AI-generated fake profiles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake
profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors
such as the one proposed in this study.

### [293] [High-dimensional multidisciplinary design optimization for aircraft eco-design / Optimisation multi-disciplinaire en grande dimension pour l'éco-conception avion en avant-projet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04711)
*Paul Saves*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This Ph.D thesis proposes an enhanced EGO (Efficient Global Optimization) approach using dimensionality reduction techniques and Bayesian optimization adaptations to solve high-dimensional (100+ variables) constrained optimization problems with mixed integer variables, specifically targeting aircraft design applications like the "DRAGON" hybrid airplane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EGO suffers from the curse of dimensionality and performs poorly on high-dimensional problems (100+ variables) commonly found in realistic aircraft design. Traditional EGO cannot efficiently handle mixed continuous and categorical variables in large-scale multidisciplinary black-box optimization problems, making direct application impractical for complex aircraft design scenarios.

Method: The approach combines: (1) Effective parameterization tools including partial least squares regression to significantly reduce design variables, (2) Adaptation of Bayesian optimization to handle discrete variables and high-dimensional spaces, (3) Sequential enrichment of adaptive GP (Gaussian Process) surrogate models, and (4) Integration of these techniques within the EGO framework for constrained optimization problems.

Result: The enhanced EGO approach successfully reduces the number of evaluations required when optimizing innovative aircraft concepts, specifically demonstrated on the "DRAGON" hybrid airplane design problem. The method effectively handles high-dimensional mixed integer design spaces that were previously intractable with standard EGO approaches.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully develops an efficient optimization approach that overcomes EGO's dimensionality limitations through dimensionality reduction and Bayesian optimization adaptations, enabling practical application to realistic aircraft design problems with 100+ mixed variables and contributing to the development of climate-impact-reducing aircraft concepts.

Abstract: The objective of this Philosophiae Doctor (Ph.D) thesis is to propose an
efficient approach for optimizing a multidisciplinary black-box model when the
optimization problem is constrained and involves a large number of mixed
integer design variables (typically 100 variables). The targeted optimization
approach, called EGO, is based on a sequential enrichment of an adaptive
surrogate model and, in this context, GP surrogate models are one of the most
widely used in engineering problems to approximate time-consuming high fidelity
models. EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution
quality. However, like any other global optimization method, EGO suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, meaning that its performance is satisfactory on
lower dimensional problems, but deteriorates as the dimensionality of the
optimization search space increases. For realistic aircraft design problems,
the typical size of the design variables can even exceed 100 and, thus, trying
to solve directly the problems using EGO is ruled out. The latter is especially
true when the problems involve both continuous and categorical variables
increasing even more the size of the search space. In this Ph.D thesis,
effective parameterization tools are investigated, including techniques like
partial least squares regression, to significantly reduce the number of design
variables. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is adapted to handle discrete
variables and high-dimensional spaces in order to reduce the number of
evaluations when optimizing innovative aircraft concepts such as the "DRAGON"
hybrid airplane to reduce their climate impact.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient projection-free algorithm for constrained difference-of-convex (DC) optimization by combining Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) with warm-starting and adaptive error bounds, building on Maskan et al.'s framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce computational overhead in solving constrained DC optimization problems (minimizing f(x) - g(x) over a compact convex region) by developing more efficient algorithms that avoid expensive projection operations.

Method: The method integrates advanced Frank-Wolfe variants, specifically the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm with warm-starting techniques and adaptive error bounds from Maskan et al.'s framework to create a projection-free approach.

Result: The empirical results demonstrate that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using the proposed combination of BPCG with warm-starting and adaptive error bounds, resulting in a highly efficient and scalable algorithm.

Conclusion: The study successfully shows that the integration of BPCG with warm-starting and adaptive error bounds creates a highly efficient and scalable projection-free algorithm for constrained DC optimization, effectively reducing computational overhead compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a difference of (smooth) convex
functions over a compact convex feasible region $P$, i.e., $\min_{x \in P} f(x)
- g(x)$, with smooth $f$ and Lipschitz continuous $g$. This computational study
builds upon and complements the framework of Maskan et al. [2025] by
integrating advanced Frank-Wolfe variants to reduce computational overhead. We
empirically show that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using a
combination of the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm
[Tsuji et al., 2022] with warm-starting and the adaptive error bound from
Maskan et al. [2025]. The result is a highly efficient and scalable
projection-free algorithm for constrained DC optimization.

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such

Conclusion: Astribot's cohesive integration of embodiment, teleoperation interface, and learning pipeline represents a significant step towards real-world, general-purpose whole-body robotic manipulation and establishes groundwork for the next generation of intelligent robots.

Abstract: Building general-purpose intelligent robots has long been a fundamental goal
of robotics. A promising approach is to mirror the evolutionary trajectory of
humans: learning through continuous interaction with the environment, with
early progress driven by the imitation of human behaviors. Achieving this goal
presents three core challenges: (1) designing safe robotic hardware with
human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable
whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating
algorithms capable of learning whole-body visuomotor policies from human
demonstrations. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose
Astribot Suite, a robot learning suite for whole-body manipulation aimed at
general daily tasks across diverse environments. We demonstrate the

### [297] [JAM: Keypoint-Guided Joint Prediction after Classification-Aware Marginal Proposal for Multi-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17152)
*Fangze Lin,Ying He,Fei Yu,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes JAM, a two-stage framework for multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving that first generates marginal trajectory proposals through classification-aware learning, then performs joint prediction guided by key waypoints to improve low-probability mode generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent joint prediction methods struggle with generating high-quality low-probability modes, which is critical for safe autonomous driving as rare but important scenarios (like sudden lane changes or emergency stops) need to be accurately predicted.

Method: A two-stage framework called JAM: (1) Marginal prediction stage that classifies queries by trajectory type to learn comprehensive mode information, (2) Joint prediction stage that uses scene context and marginal proposals as inputs, with explicit key waypoints guidance to capture critical information from initial predictions.

Result: Achieved competitive performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark, with JAM outperforming other prediction frameworks and achieving state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed JAM framework successfully addresses the low-quality generation problem of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction through its two-stage design and keypoint guidance, demonstrating superior performance on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in
autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality
generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle
this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework
named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware
marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction
process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to
learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information
for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint
prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals
from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We
explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in
better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial
predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world
Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show
that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the
framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction
frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory
prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to

*Jannis Bähler,Diego Paez-Granados,Jorge Peña-Queralta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based shared control system for omnidirectional smart electric wheelchairs that converts 2D user inputs to 3D motions while ensuring collision-free navigation and user comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shared control approaches for holonomic wheelchair systems lead to unintuitive behavior and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional driving, creating poor user experience and increased cognitive load for drivers.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based approach trained in Isaac Gym that takes 2D user input and outputs 3D motion commands. The method compares different RL agent architectures and reward functions, with evaluation metrics focused on cognitive load and user comfort.

Result: The system achieves collision-free navigation with smart wheelchair orientation and demonstrates better or competitive smoothness compared to previous non-learning methods. Successfully performed sim-to-real transfer for real-world implementation.

Conclusion: The authors achieved the first real-world implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility platform, demonstrating improved user experience through reduced cognitive load and enhanced navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the
driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of
shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots.
However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive
behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional
driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which
takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and
reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and
tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and
reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort.
We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly
orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared
to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real
transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world
implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility
platform.

*Jayadeep Jacob,Wenzheng Zhang,Houston Warren,Paulo Borges,Tirthankar Bandyopadhyay,Fabio Ramos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that combines 3D point clouds and proprioceptive touch to enable robotic arms to manipulate deformable objects using whole-arm contact, demonstrated through power line clearance tasks with successful sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects is challenging due to limited realistic model synthesis, high perception uncertainty, and lack of efficient spatial abstractions. Traditional end-effector-only approaches are insufficient for contact-rich whole-arm interactions required for such tasks.

Method: A model-free reinforcement learning framework that integrates 3D point clouds and proprioceptive touch indicators for full body contact awareness. Uses distributional state representation with kernel mean embeddings for training efficiency, and introduces a context-agnostic occlusion heuristic for clearing deformables from target regions.

Result: The agent successfully generates creative strategies using multiple arm links for de-occlusion in power line clearance scenarios. Achieves zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, enabling the robotic arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses deformable object manipulation challenges by combining multimodal sensing with distributional reinforcement learning, demonstrating practical applicability through successful real-world deployment in power line clearance tasks.

Abstract: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects presents a substantial challenge
with widespread applicability, but requires contact-rich whole-arm
interactions. A potential solution must address the limited capacity for
realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of
efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for
learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and
proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body
contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our
reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state
representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training
efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel
context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region
for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario
and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple
arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy
transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion
patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

*Po-Yen Wu,Cheng-Yu Kuo,Yuki Kadokawa,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that teaches robots to use general-purpose tools while considering tool lifespan, incorporating stress-based Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation into the reward function and achieving up to 8.01x improvement in tool longevity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In inaccessible environments, robots must use general-purpose tools without predefined usage strategies, creating a challenge where tool longevity is highly sensitive to usage patterns. The key problem is learning policies that both complete tasks effectively and prolong tool lifespan.

Method: The authors develop an RL framework that integrates tool lifespan considerations into policy optimization by: (1) using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, (2) incorporating RUL into the RL reward function, and (3) implementing an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism to handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated post-execution.

Result: The method was validated on simulated and real-world tasks including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. Results show consistent tool lifespan prolongation (up to 8.01x improvement in simulation) and effective transfer to real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed lifespan-guided RL framework successfully enables robots to learn tool-use policies that balance task completion with tool preservation, demonstrating practical value for robotic applications in challenging environments where tool replacement is difficult or impossible.

Abstract: In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely
on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are
not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive
to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot
learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's
lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a
factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based
on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide
policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL
can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward
Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on
estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across
simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and
Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies
consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer
effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of
learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-Touch enhances robot policies with tactile sensing without fine-tuning the base Vision-Language-Action model, using a tactile-language model for semantic feedback and a diffusion controller for action refinement in contact-rich tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models lack tactile interpretation capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich manipulation tasks. The challenge stems from the absence of large multi-modal datasets that include tactile information.

Method: The approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a pipeline using a pretrained tactile-language model that provides semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions using tactile signals for precise contact-rich manipulation.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrate that the dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves both task planning efficiency and execution precision in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Touch successfully integrates tactile sensing into generalist robot policies without requiring fine-tuning of the base VLA model, providing an effective solution for enhancing robot performance in tactile-dependent tasks through semantic feedback and action refinement.

Abstract: Tactile feedback is generally recognized to be crucial for effective
interaction with the physical world. However, state-of-the-art
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use
tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks.
Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the
absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that
enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without
fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a
pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides
semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a
diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile
signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task
planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision. Code is open-sourced

*Thomas P Zollo,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models for robotics, introducing methods like prompt ensembles and action-wise Platt scaling to improve uncertainty quantification and make robots more trustworthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high task success rates but also reliable confidence estimation of success likelihood. Current VLA models lack systematic study of confidence calibration, which is crucial for safe and reliable robotic deployment.

Method: The paper introduces two main methods: (1) Prompt ensembles - a Bayesian-inspired algorithm that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions, and (2) Action-wise Platt scaling - a calibration method that recalibrates each action dimension independently to improve confidence estimates.

Result: Extensive benchmarking shows that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Prompt ensembles consistently improve calibration across datasets and VLA variants. The study reveals that confidence is most reliable after making some progress in tasks, and there's differential miscalibration across action dimensions.

Conclusion: The study establishes foundational tools and understanding for developing VLA models that are both highly performant and trustworthy through reliable uncertainty quantification, paving the way for safer robotic systems that can better assess their own capabilities.

Abstract: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but
also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this
end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in
vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations
and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin
with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between
task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants,
finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we
introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm
that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently
improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time
horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some
progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we
reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose
action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension
independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is
to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render
VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty
quantification.

*Shuai Yang,Hao Li,Yilun Chen,Bin Wang,Yang Tian,Tai Wang,Hanqing Wang,Feng Zhao,Yiyi Liao,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: InstructVLA is an end-to-end vision-language-action model that preserves flexible reasoning capabilities while achieving superior manipulation performance through a novel training paradigm called VLA-IT, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models on both in-domain tasks and generalization benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language-action models often sacrifice multimodal reasoning for action generation or vice versa, are limited to task-specific data, and suffer from catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. There's a need for a model that can integrate multimodal reasoning with precise action generation while maintaining the flexible reasoning abilities of large vision-language models.

Method: The paper introduces Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), a novel training paradigm that uses multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation. The training combines standard VLM corpora with a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset to preserve reasoning capabilities while learning manipulation skills.

Result: InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA on in-domain SimplerEnv tasks. On the new SimplerEnv-Instruct benchmark (80 tasks requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding), it outperforms fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and GPT-4o-aided action expert by 29%. The model also surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and demonstrates inference-time scaling capabilities in both simulated and real-world settings.

Conclusion: InstructVLA successfully bridges the gap between intuitive human-robot interaction and efficient policy learning by maintaining flexible reasoning while delivering superior manipulation performance. The results demonstrate the model's potential for enabling more natural and steerable human-robot interactions without compromising on task execution capabilities.

Abstract: To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.

### [304] [CA-Cut: Crop-Aligned Cutout for Data Augmentation to Learn More Robust Under-Canopy Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17727)
*Robel Mamo,Taeyeong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut), a novel data augmentation technique for visual under-canopy navigation that strategically masks regions around crop rows to improve model robustness in complex agricultural environments, achieving up to 36.9% reduction in prediction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual under-canopy navigation models require large amounts of training data for reliable field deployment, but data collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional augmentation techniques may be insufficient for complex under-canopy environments with frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform crop spacing.

Method: The authors propose Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut), a masking-based augmentation technique that randomly masks regions in input images spatially distributed around crop rows. This encourages models to capture high-level contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed, simulating real-world occlusions in agricultural environments.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public cornfield dataset show that CA-Cut significantly improves robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual navigation. The method achieves up to 36.9% reduction in prediction error and enhances both prediction accuracy and generalizability across diverse environments compared to traditional augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: Masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions in under-canopy navigation tasks. Biasing mask distribution toward crop rows is critical for performance improvement. The study includes ablation studies on mask number, size, and spatial distribution to optimize overall performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.

*Haichuan Li,Changda Tian,Panos Trahanias,Tomi Westerlund*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IndoorBEV is a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View method that projects 3D indoor point clouds to 2D BEV grids for robust object detection, using query-based decoder to predict object classes and instance masks instead of traditional bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bounding box methods struggle with diverse object shapes, clutter, and co-existence of static and dynamic elements in complex indoor 3D point clouds, creating significant challenges for robotic perception systems.

Method: The method projects 3D scenes into 2D BEV grids using an axis compact encoder and window-based backbone to extract spatial features, then employs a query-based decoder head with learned object queries to predict object classes and instance masks in BEV space.

Result: IndoorBEV effectively captures footprints of both static and dynamic objects regardless of shape, demonstrated on a custom indoor dataset with diverse object classes including static objects, robots, and miscellaneous items.

Conclusion: The mask-centric BEV formulation provides a robust alternative to bounding box regression for indoor scene understanding, with results directly usable for downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion prediction, and planning.

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents
significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object
shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where
traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we
propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor
mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles
naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to
distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results
is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion
prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and
a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A
query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently
predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric
formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic
objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding
box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom
indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its
potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

### [306] [A Highly Clean Recipe Dataset with Ingredient States Annotation for State Probing Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17232)
*Mashiro Toyooka,Kiyoharu Aizawa,Yoko Yamakata*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well Large Language Models understand cooking processes by testing their ability to track ingredient state changes during recipe procedures, using a new Japanese recipe dataset with detailed state annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are trained on procedural texts but don't observe real-world phenomena, making it challenging for them to track intermediate ingredient states in cooking recipes where such states are often omitted from the text.

Method: The authors apply state probing methodology to cooking domain by: (1) constructing a Japanese recipe dataset with clear ingredient state change annotations, (2) designing three novel evaluation tasks to test LLMs' ability to track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients at intermediate steps, and (3) testing on models like Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B.

Result: Experiments show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves LLMs' understanding of cooking processes, with the tested models achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs on the proposed tasks.

Conclusion: State probing can effectively evaluate LLMs' understanding of cooking procedures, and incorporating ingredient state knowledge enhances model performance in understanding recipe processes, demonstrating the value of this approach for evaluating world knowledge in language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural
texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of
cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients
are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states
and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a
method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the
domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well
LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We
first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate
annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and
controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to
evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify
ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used
LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state
knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving
performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This study shows that weather-aware AI systems for taxi operations achieve 107.3% revenue increases compared to only 14% from route-optimization alone, revealing that current AI research underestimates AI's potential by focusing too narrowly on single functions rather than comprehensive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI research in transportation focuses narrowly on route optimization, achieving only modest 14% productivity gains, while potentially missing larger opportunities by not considering comprehensive approaches that integrate multiple operational factors like weather conditions.

Method: The researchers developed weather-aware AI systems combining deep learning meteorological prediction with machine learning positioning optimization, then compared performance using simulation data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches.

Result: Weather-aware AI systems increased driver revenue by 107.3% versus 14% from route-optimization alone, with weather prediction contributing the largest productivity gain (correlation r=0.575 between weather and demand), resulting in annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver and identifying an $8.9 billion market opportunity.

Conclusion: Current AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by focusing on isolated functions like routing algorithms, and future AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing single functions.

Abstract: While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve
taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture
only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive
weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction
with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance
against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation
data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that
weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\%
improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the
largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between
meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals
annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback
periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current
AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by
focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents
an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future
AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple
operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated
functions.

### [308] [Doubly robust outlier resistant inference on causal treatment effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17439)
*Joonsung Kang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a doubly robust estimator for average treatment effects that handles outliers without removing them, using robust outcome regression and covariate balancing propensity scores within a penalized empirical likelihood framework, along with finite-sample confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outliers severely distort causal effect estimation in observational studies, especially in small samples where detecting and removing outliers is difficult. Existing methods either exclude outliers or rely on asymptotic properties for confidence intervals, which may be unreliable in finite samples.

Method: The authors develop a doubly robust point estimator using: (1) robust estimating equations for outcome regression, (2) covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) for propensity score modeling, (3) variable selection to prevent overfitting, all unified under a penalized empirical likelihood framework. They also derive optimal finite-sample confidence intervals.

Result: Simulations and real-world application on hypertension data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness when outliers are present.

Conclusion: The proposed doubly robust estimator effectively handles outliers in causal inference without exclusion, providing more reliable treatment effect estimates and confidence intervals in finite samples compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Outliers can severely distort causal effect estimation in observational
studies, yet this issue has received limited attention in the literature. Their
influence is especially pronounced in small sample sizes, where detecting and
removing outliers becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is essential to
estimate treatment effects robustly without excluding these influential data
points. To address this, we propose a doubly robust point estimator for the
average treatment effect under a contaminated model that includes outliers.
Robustness in outcome regression is achieved through a robust estimating
equation, while covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) ensure resilience
in propensity score modeling.
  To prevent model overfitting due to the inclusion of numerous parameters, we
incorporate variable selection. All these components are unified under a
penalized empirical likelihood framework. For confidence interval estimation,
most existing approaches rely on asymptotic properties, which may be unreliable
in finite samples. We derive an optimal finite-sample confidence interval for
the average treatment effect using our proposed estimating equation, ensuring
that the interval bounds remain unaffected by outliers. Through simulations and
a real-world application involving hypertension data with outliers, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in
both accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: RetroDFM-R successfully addresses the limitations of existing retrosynthesis methods by providing both high accuracy and explainability through its explicit reasoning process, offering human-interpretable insights that enhance trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery,
has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless,
existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and
explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often
lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither
consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we
introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed
specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement
learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly
enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind
human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical
utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts
multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world
drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit
reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing
trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.

### [310] [Computational Performance Bounds Prediction in Quantum Computing with Unstable Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17043)
*Jinyang Li,Samudra Dasgupta,Yuhong Song,Lei Yang,Travis Humble,Weiwen Jiang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QuBound is a data-driven workflow that predicts computational performance bounds for quantum computing by decomposing historical performance traces and using LSTM networks to handle time-varying noise, achieving 10^6x speedup over simulation and 10x narrower bounds than analytical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum devices suffer from time-varying noise that creates barriers to quantum supremacy and makes job scheduling difficult in quantum-centric supercomputing. Existing noisy quantum simulations are inefficient and unscalable, while current predictors only generate single performance values rather than bounds, making it crucial to develop efficient methods for predicting computational performance bounds under fluctuating noise conditions.

Method: The paper proposes QuBound, a data-driven workflow that: (1) decomposes historical performance traces to isolate noise sources, (2) uses a novel encoder to embed circuit and noise information, and (3) processes this information through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict performance bounds rather than single values.

Result: QuBound achieves over 10^6 speedup compared to simulation methods and produces bounds that are over 10x narrower than state-of-the-art analytical approaches. The experimental results show that existing learning-based predictors fall outside performance bounds, while QuBound's predictions with performance decomposition better fit within the bounds.

Conclusion: QuBound successfully addresses the challenge of predicting quantum computational performance under time-varying noise by providing efficient and accurate performance bounds. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in both computational efficiency and bound accuracy compared to existing methods, making it valuable for quantum system management and job scheduling in next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing.

Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting
devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses
significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact
is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the
next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient
and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job
scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of
jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional
objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum
device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is
vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and
scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely
QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical
performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to
embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art
learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value
instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing
approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our
QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds.
Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits
with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is
over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.

*Wei-You Liao,Yuxuan Du,Xinbiao Wang,Tian-Ci Tian,Yong Luo,Bo Du,Dacheng Tao,He-Liang Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces predictive surrogates - classical learning models that can efficiently emulate quantum processors' behavior, reducing the need for expensive quantum hardware access while maintaining computational advantages for quantum simulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and limited availability of large-scale quantum processors creates a bottleneck that restricts their widespread application in scientific discovery, necessitating alternative approaches to leverage quantum computational advantages more efficiently.

Method: The authors propose two predictive surrogates - classical learning models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of quantum processors with provable computational efficiency. These surrogates are trained to mimic quantum processor outputs without requiring direct quantum hardware access.

Result: The predictive surrogates successfully emulated a quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabled efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for transverse-field Ising models, identified non-equilibrium Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases, and reduced measurement overhead by orders of magnitude while sometimes outperforming conventional quantum-resource-intensive approaches.

Conclusion: Predictive surrogates establish a practical pathway to broaden the impact of advanced quantum processors by significantly reducing quantum hardware requirements while maintaining or exceeding performance, making quantum computational advantages more accessible for diverse applications.

Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in
scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating
large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable
future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we
introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning
models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor
with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two
predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum
processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential
in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a
quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling
efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of
transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet
symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the
predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of
magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,
quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish
predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of
advanced quantum processors.

### [312] [Compatibility of Max and Sum Objectives for Committee Selection and $k$-Facility Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17063)
*Yue Han,Elliot Anshelevich*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper studies the metric facility location problem with k facilities serving clients, analyzing the compatibility of four different objectives (sum/max of distances × sum/max of client costs) and proving that solutions can simultaneously achieve near-optimal performance across multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facility location problems optimize single objectives, but in practice, decision-makers often care about multiple criteria simultaneously. The authors are motivated to understand whether it's possible to find solutions that perform well across different objectives rather than having to choose one objective at the expense of others.

Method: The paper analyzes four different objective functions in the metric facility location problem: combinations of (sum vs. max) distance aggregation per client and (sum vs. max) aggregation across all clients. They study the compatibility between pairs of these objectives and prove the existence of solutions that are simultaneously close-to-optimal for multiple objectives.

Result: The authors demonstrate that solutions exist which are simultaneously close-to-optimum for pairs of the four studied objectives. This means that when selecting facilities or forming committees, it's often possible to achieve good performance across multiple criteria without significant trade-offs.

Conclusion: The research shows that multi-objective optimization in facility location problems is more tractable than might be expected - solutions can often satisfy multiple desiderata simultaneously rather than requiring sacrifices between competing objectives. This has practical implications for facility placement and committee selection problems where multiple stakeholder concerns must be balanced.

Abstract: We study a version of the metric facility location problem (or, equivalently,
variants of the committee selection problem) in which we must choose $k$
facilities in an arbitrary metric space to serve some set of clients $C$. We
consider four different objectives, where each client $i\in C$ attempts to
minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen
facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the
maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single
objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each
other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously
close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that
when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often
possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same
time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.

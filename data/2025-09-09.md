### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++ improves upon standard label smoothing by preserving inter-class relationships while reducing overconfidence in neural network predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard label smoothing assigns equal importance to all non-target classes, which destroys valuable inter-class relationships and semantic connections between categories.

Method: Proposes Label Smoothing++ that assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes while accounting for their inter-class relationships, using fixed target labels but allowing the network to learn non-target class labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the method mitigates overconfident predictions while promoting inter-class relationships and improving generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++ effectively addresses the limitations of standard label smoothing by preserving semantic relationships between classes while maintaining regularization benefits.

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD is a visual interactive labeling tool that combines human expertise with AI for object detection, using visual analytics to make the annotation process more transparent and effective than automated active learning alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection requires large labeled datasets that are expensive to create. Active learning methods lack transparency and may miss informative samples. Human-in-the-loop approaches with visual analytics can bridge this gap by leveraging human intuition alongside AI.

Method: Developed VILOD tool featuring t-SNE projections of image features, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views. Users can explore data, interpret model states, and implement diverse sample selection strategies in an iterative human-AI workflow for object detection.

Result: Comparative use cases showed VILOD makes model states and dataset characteristics more interpretable, enabling distinct labeling strategies. Visually-guided strategies achieved competitive object detection performance compared to automated uncertainty sampling baseline.

Conclusion: VILOD contributes a novel tool that makes human-in-the-loop active learning workflows for object detection annotation more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective by combining human expertise with AI through interactive visualizations.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) with dynamic alpha parameter that adjusts during training based on student-teacher gap, replacing fixed alpha in traditional KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static alpha hyperparameter in traditional knowledge distillation is suboptimal because the optimal balance between hard and soft supervision changes during training.

Method: Make alpha learnable parameter; introduce formula to compute alpha dynamically based on student-teacher discrepancies; add Context-Aware Module (MLP + Attention) to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 teacher and ResNet-18 student show superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines and more stable convergence.

Conclusion: Dynamic adaptation of distillation weight alpha based on student-teacher performance gap improves knowledge transfer effectiveness and training stability.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

pipeline for aligning video and EEG data pairs, facilitating the training of
multimodal large models with EEG alignment capabilities. Personalized EEG
signals are generated using a self-play graph network (SPGN) integrated with a
diffusion model. As a major contribution, we release a new dataset comprising
over 1000 samples of SEED-VD video stimuli paired with generated 62-channel EEG
signals at 200 Hz and emotion labels, enabling video-EEG alignment and
advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion
analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study compares three edge-centric measures (FRC, ORC, EBC) for pruning randomly wired neural networks, finding FRC offers computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different network connectivity patterns impact learning efficiency and model performance, and to explore edge-centric measures for network pruning and optimization in randomly wired neural networks.

Method: Used three edge-centric network measures (Forman-Ricci curvature, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and edge betweenness centrality) to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses while pruning others. Applied to three network generators (ER, WS, BA models) for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification.

Result: FRC-based pruning effectively simplifies RWNNs with significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC. Provides insights into trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed networks.

Conclusion: Forman-Ricci curvature offers a computationally efficient alternative to Ollivier-Ricci curvature for neural network pruning, achieving comparable performance while being more efficient to compute.

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

### [6] [Optical Music Recognition of Jazz Lead Sheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05329)
*Juan Carlos Martinez-Sevilla,Francesco Foscarin,Patricia Garcia-Iasci,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dataset and OMR model for handwritten jazz lead sheets, addressing challenges of chord recognition and handwritten variability with synthetic data and pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OMR systems cannot handle chords in handwritten jazz lead sheets, and handwritten images present high variability and quality issues that need specialized solutions.

Method: Created a dataset of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets with ground truth scores, generated synthetic score images, developed a specialized OMR model with specific tokenization for jazz data, and utilized synthetic scores with pretrained models.

Result: Produced a comprehensive dataset of 2021 staves with aligned ground truth, developed a functional OMR model capable of processing jazz lead sheets with chords, and made all code, data, and models publicly available.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses OMR challenges for handwritten jazz lead sheets through a combination of novel dataset creation, synthetic data generation, and specialized model development with appropriate tokenization strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM framework uses synthetic data with 4 types of annotations and a two-stage self-correcting inference process to improve object recognition robustness against domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments expose object recognition models to various domain shifts (image statistics, pose changes, occlusion, class confusion) that cause severe accuracy drops.

Method: Create synthetic dataset with 4-clue annotations (bounding boxes, class names, object captions, scene captions), then fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct. At inference, use two-stage Re-Thinking: generate clues first, then re-examine and iteratively correct them.

Result: RT-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines across robustness benchmarks isolating individual domain shifts.

Conclusion: Integration of structured multimodal evidence with explicit self-critique loop is a promising approach for reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

*Diwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based system using YOLOv5 and Kalman filter to measure badminton smash speed through video analysis, making performance analytics accessible to amateur players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports performance measurement technology is expensive and complex, creating barriers for amateur and recreational badminton players who need access to crucial metrics like shot speed and angle for development.

Method: Uses custom-trained YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection combined with Kalman filter for trajectory tracking, implementing video-based kinematic speed estimation with spatiotemporal scaling from standard smartphone recordings.

Result: Developed a cost-effective, user-friendly mobile application that automatically calculates shuttlecock velocity, making high-level performance analytics accessible through ubiquitous smartphone technology.

Conclusion: The system successfully democratizes access to professional-level badminton performance metrics, empowering players at all skill levels to analyze and improve their game through affordable smartphone-based technology.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [9] [A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335)
*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale Chinese handwriting database and enhanced toolbox reveal hierarchical linguistic influences on character, radical, and stroke level handwriting processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about linguistic components modulating Chinese handwriting and the absence of comprehensive tools for capturing fine-grained handwriting data.

Method: Constructed a large-scale handwriting database with 42 Chinese speakers writing 1200 characters each, enhanced OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for stroke-level trajectory capture and batch processing, and used multiple regression analysis.

Result: Orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and execution across all levels, phonological factors influence execution at all levels, with hierarchical attenuation - strongest at character level, then radical, weakest at stroke levels.

Conclusion: Handwriting preparation and execution at radical and stroke levels are closely linked to linguistic components, and the database/toolbox provide valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research.

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

### [10] [Anticipatory Fall Detection in Humans with Hybrid Directed Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05337)
*Younggeol Cho,Gokhan Solak,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lorenzini,Andrea Fortuna,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid DGNN-LSTM model for anticipatory fall detection using skeletal features, decoupling motion prediction and gait classification to detect falls before they occur with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems focus on fall detection but lack predictive capabilities. The transient state between stability and falling remains unexplored, limiting proactive intervention in assistive robotics.

Method: Combines Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) for gait classification (stable/transient/fall) with LSTM networks for motion prediction. Uses real-time skeletal features from video sequences as input.

Result: Superior performance on OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets compared to DGNN-only models and literature approaches. Lower prediction error and higher recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Decoupling prediction and classification improves performance over unified approaches. Enables monitoring of transient state, providing valuable insights for advanced assistance systems.

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

### [11] [Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340)
*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of K-Means (hard clustering) vs Fuzzy C-Means (soft clustering) for brain tumor segmentation from MRI, showing K-Means is faster but FCM provides better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and disease monitoring, but challenging due to tumor heterogeneity.

Method: Used BraTS2020 dataset with Gaussian filtering and CLAHE pre-processing. Compared K-Means (hard clustering) and FCM (soft clustering) approaches for tumor segmentation.

Result: K-Means achieved faster processing (0.3s per image) but lower accuracy (DSC 0.43). FCM provided higher accuracy (DSC 0.67) but was slower (1.3s per image).

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between computational efficiency (K-Means) and segmentation accuracy (FCM) in brain tumor segmentation from MRI.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model for multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests using enhanced CNN with attention modules and data augmentation, achieving 96.90% accuracy and 0.96 F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pest and disease classification methods are limited to binary classification, which restricts practical applications where identifying specific disease/pest types is essential for precision agriculture.

Method: Enhanced pre-trained CNN model with attention-based modules and comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to address class imbalance in multi-class classification.

Result: Achieved 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image dataset, outperforming other approaches using the same datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed robust deep learning model successfully addresses the limitations of binary classification and provides accurate multi-class identification of onion crop diseases and pests for precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

### [13] [Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342)
*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF is an inversion-free text-to-image editing framework that models velocity field discrepancies to improve editing quality while avoiding over-smoothing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-smoothing issues in prior distillation sampling approaches for text-to-image editing and provide a principled framework that bridges score-based diffusion and velocity-based optimization methods.

Method: Distillation-based approach that explicitly models source-target velocity field discrepancies, introduces time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to target trajectory, and connects to existing methods through theoretical analysis.

Result: Achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability without architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing tasks.

Conclusion: DVRF provides a theoretically grounded framework that generalizes previous methods while delivering improved performance in text-to-image editing applications.

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

*Zahid Ullah,Minki Hong,Tahir Mahmood,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic integration of attention mechanisms into 5 CNN architectures improves medical image classification by enhancing feature focus and discriminative performance across brain tumor MRI and histopathology datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs often fail to capture fine-grained features critical for accurate medical diagnosis, requiring enhanced attention to salient regions for better performance.

Method: Augmented VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5 with Squeeze and Excitation blocks or hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Modules for adaptive feature recalibration.

Result: Attention-augmented CNNs consistently outperformed baseline architectures across all metrics, with EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieving the highest overall performance on both medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms enhance both classification accuracy and feature localization, providing a systematic framework for developing robust and interpretable deep learning systems for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

*Cuong Manh Hoang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised framework for instance segmentation that eliminates the need for human annotations by using MultiCut algorithm, mask filtering, superpixel-guided mask loss, and adaptive self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotations for instance segmentation are costly to collect, creating a need for methods that can effectively segment objects without requiring labeled training data.

Method: Uses MultiCut algorithm on self-supervised features for coarse segmentation, mask filtering for quality control, superpixel-guided mask loss (hard and soft loss), and adaptive self-training to refine mask quality.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on public datasets for both instance segmentation and object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully achieves high-quality instance segmentation without human annotations, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning approaches for computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hybrid ML approach combining Structure Preserving Neural Networks for mechanical cell movement analysis with ANNs for environmental factors, achieving accurate cell trajectory prediction and mitosis event forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex cell biomechanics phenomena is crucial for studying embryogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor growth, but current methods struggle with capturing the many interactions and collective cell decisions.

Method: Combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks (for mechanical cell movement analysis) with Artificial Neural Networks (for environmental factors from Computer Vision), plus a separate Neural Network model for mitosis event prediction.

Result: The model successfully predicts complete cell trajectories with high accuracy in both simulated and real cell migration cases using a roll-out policy approach.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML approach effectively integrates mechanical and environmental factors to provide accurate predictions of cell behavior, including migration patterns and division events.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: EMCAD provides a computationally efficient solution for brain tumor segmentation with moderate but stable performance, suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical
image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from
healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An
efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor
segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.
However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs.

### [19] [FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)
*Tejaswini Medi,Hsien-Yi Wang,Arianna Rampini,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a frequency-aware VAE framework that decouples low/high-frequency optimization to improve texture reconstruction in latent generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent tokenizers prioritize low-frequency reconstruction at the expense of high-frequency fidelity, causing over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts in textured regions.

Method: Wavelet-based frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) that explicitly separates optimization of low- and high-frequency components using frequency decomposition analysis.

Result: Improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure, bridging the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware optimization is crucial for realistic image representation, with applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep CNN deployment is limited by computational and memory overhead, requiring efficient compression methods for edge/mobile platforms.

Method: Fuses gradient-based sensitivity, Taylor expansion, and KL divergence metrics with exponential scaling to identify filters with inconsistent importance scores across criteria.

Result: Achieves over 80% FLOPs reduction while maintaining up to 98.23% of baseline accuracy at 70% pruning rates, outperforming traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, deterministic single-shot pruning solution for scalable CNN compression, enabling practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,José R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of layer-freezing strategies for YOLOv8/v10 in UAV applications shows no universal optimal approach - effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics, with up to 28% GPU memory savings and sometimes better mAP@50 than full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying YOLO architectures in resource-constrained UAV environments requires efficient transfer learning, but the impact of different freezing configurations on modern YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 remains unexplored, especially regarding freezing depth, dataset characteristics, and training dynamics.

Method: Systematic investigation of multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four challenging infrastructure monitoring datasets, integrated with gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to understand training dynamics.

Result: No universal optimal freezing strategy - effectiveness depends on data properties. Freezing backbone preserves general-purpose features, shallower freeze handles extreme class imbalance better. Achieves up to 28% GPU memory reduction and sometimes surpasses full fine-tuning mAP@50 scores. Gradient analysis shows distinct convergence patterns.

Conclusion: Provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies, offering evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in resource-constrained scenarios like UAV deployments.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Motivation: To create a rotation-equivariant deep learning framework that preserves geometric properties while being computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained systems like robotics.

Method: Approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition using real-valued operations, introduces Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for stability, and extends quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence in image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling in object detection (COCO, DOTA), and establishes SOTA for quaternion CNNs in detection tasks.

Conclusion: QUAN demonstrates strong potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and has applications in other domains due to its efficiency and geometric preservation.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA introduces visibility-aware language aggregation and streaming weighted geometric median to address background noise and multi-view inconsistency issues in distilling 2D language features into 3D Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D Gaussians suffer from two fundamental issues: background Gaussians getting the same features as foreground ones despite negligible contributions, and multi-view inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings.

Method: VALA uses visibility-aware language aggregation that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. It also employs a streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features.

Result: The method achieves robust, view-consistent language feature embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner, improving open-vocabulary localization and segmentation across reference datasets.

Conclusion: VALA consistently surpasses existing works by effectively addressing background noise and multi-view inconsistency problems in 3D Gaussian language feature distillation.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contrastive learning framework called DuoCLR that uses skeleton sequences and novel data augmentation for improved human action segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous representation learning works focus on action recognition with isolated sequence-wise representations, lacking exploitation of multi-scale representations and cross-sequence variations needed for action segmentation.

Method: Proposes 'Shuffle and Warp' data augmentation strategy and two surrogate tasks: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) for intra-class similarities and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR) for inter-class contexts. Uses Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network pre-trained on trimmed skeleton data.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance boost over state-of-the-art methods in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks when evaluated on untrimmed datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DuoCLR framework effectively learns multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation through novel augmentation and contrastive learning tasks, showing superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

*Yihong Leng,Siming Zheng,Jinwei Chen,Bo Li,Jiaojiao Li,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RED network uses robust event-guided deblurring with modality-specific disentangled representation to handle incomplete event streams and improve motion deblurring performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based deblurring methods overlook the inherent incompleteness of event streams caused by DVS thresholding mechanisms, which compromises motion priors and limits effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) for random event masking, disentangled OmniAttention for modeling correlations, and interactive modules to enhance motion-sensitive areas and inject semantic context.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed RED network effectively addresses event stream incompleteness and demonstrates superior deblurring performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in model quantization, making it suitable for edge computing and real-time applications.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhiling Ye,Cong Zhou,Xiubao Zhang,Haifeng Shen,Weihong Deng,Quan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-image 3D Gaussian head framework that separates reconstruction and reenactment, achieving 90 FPS rendering at 512x512 resolution with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create controllable 3D avatars from single portrait images with high efficiency and quality, addressing the need for real-time performance and generalization capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training approach using WebSSL-based large-scale one-shot Gaussian head generator, with separate reconstruction and reenactment modules. Ultra-lightweight Gaussian avatar driven by control signals.

Result: Achieves 90 FPS at 512x512 resolution, demonstrates scaling law benefits (larger reconstruction modules improve performance), and maintains driving efficiency due to separation design.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, providing efficient high-quality avatar generation from single images.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MFFI dataset addresses limitations in current Deepfake detection by providing diverse forgery methods, varied facial scenes, authentic data, and real-world degradation operations to better simulate real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Deepfake detection methods are limited by existing datasets that lack diversity in forgery techniques, facial scenes, authentic data, and real-world degradation, making them inadequate for real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image (MFFI) dataset with four strategic dimensions: wider forgery methods (50 different techniques), varied facial scenes, diversified authentic data, and multi-level degradation operations, containing 1024K image samples.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show MFFI outperforms existing datasets in scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability, and detection difficulty gradients, validating its technical advancement and practical utility.

Conclusion: MFFI dataset successfully addresses the limitations of current Deepfake detection datasets and provides a more realistic simulation of real-world conditions for improved face forgery detection research.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The

*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph proposes a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling approach for video summarization, using recursive graph networks to model object and frame relationships with semantic language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video summarization methods focused on temporal modeling but ignored fine-grained visual entities like objects. Language-guided approaches require better semantic understanding of complex videos.

Method: Recursive spatiotemporal graph networks that formulate objects and frames as nodes in spatial and temporal graphs, incorporating language queries for semantic relationships and using recursive refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for both generic and query-focused video summarization in supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: VideoGraph effectively models semantic relationships between visual entities using language guidance and recursive graph refinement, demonstrating superior performance in video summarization tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

*Juan Yeo,Ijun Jang,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) framework for self-supervised dense representation learning that transfers semantic knowledge from pretrained models to dense feature space through distribution alignment between teacher and student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods focus on global image representations but fail to capture localized semantics needed for dense prediction tasks that require spatial precision and fine-grained detail.

Method: Uses additional self-supervised learning on pretrained representations with Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) objective to align dense feature distributions between teacher and student models, capturing statistical dependencies and structural relationships of dense patches. Also investigates specialized augmentation strategies for dense representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across various dense vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively transfers existing semantic knowledge into dense feature space, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach for dense representation learning.

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Hanzhen Wang,Jiaming Xu,Jiayi Pan,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA is a training-free token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that uses both local and global context information to achieve significant speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for VLA models only use local information from current actions, ignoring global context from prior actions, which causes significant performance drops (>20% success rate) and limited speedup.

Method: Two-level pruning with heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level using global history and local context, (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level based on layer-specific importance, (3) Lightweight action-aware controller that classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained and adjusts pruning aggressiveness accordingly.

Result: Achieves 1.46x speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57x speedup on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 compared to OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss on LIBERO benchmark.

Conclusion: Leveraging both local and global context information enables effective token pruning for VLA models, achieving substantial computational speedup while maintaining performance, addressing the limitations of previous methods that ignored global context.

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

### [34] [SuMa: A Subspace Mapping Approach for Robust and Effective Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05625)
*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa is a novel concept erasure method that uses subspace mapping to robustly remove narrow concepts like copyrighted characters while maintaining image quality, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods fail to handle narrow concepts (copyrighted characters, celebrities) effectively while maintaining robustness and image quality, creating copyright and legal concerns.

Method: Subspace Mapping (SuMa) derives a target subspace representing the concept to erase, then neutralizes it by mapping to a reference subspace that minimizes distance between them.

Result: SuMa achieves image quality comparable to effectiveness-focused methods while matching the completeness of robustness-focused methods across four erasure tasks.

Conclusion: SuMa successfully addresses the challenge of erasing narrow concepts with both robustness and effectiveness, providing a solution for copyright and legal concerns in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning creates better vegetation property embeddings from aerial hyperspectral images than direct use of spectral data for downstream ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image analysis with limited labels is challenging in precision agriculture, requiring effective representations of tree vegetation properties.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings that reflect vegetation properties from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields.

Result: Tree representations using vegetation property-related embedding space outperform direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties in downstream machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning provides superior embeddings for representing tree vegetation properties from hyperspectral imagery compared to raw spectral data.

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11x achieves best performance (63.7% mAP@0.5) on Bangladeshi vehicle detection but is slow; medium variants offer optimal balance between accuracy and speed for local vehicle types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection systems trained on non-Bangladeshi datasets fail to identify local vehicle types, creating gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions like Bangladesh.

Method: Evaluated six YOLO variants on custom dataset with 29 Bangladeshi vehicle classes using high-resolution mobile-captured images, manually annotated with YOLO format bounding boxes.

Result: YOLOv11x achieved highest mAP@0.5 (63.7%) but slow inference (45.8ms); medium variants (YOLOv8m/YOLOv11m) balanced performance (62.5%/61.8% mAP) with faster inference (14-15ms). Rare vehicles showed near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalance.

Conclusion: Research provides foundation for Bangladesh-specific object detection systems, addressing critical needs for autonomous vehicle technology in developing regions where generic models fail.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

TL;DR: EditIDv2 is a tuning-free solution for high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs that maintains identity consistency while enabling deep semantic editing with minimal data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character editing methods struggle with degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity consistency breakdowns when handling long text narratives with multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships.

Method: Decomposes PerceiverAttention, introduces ID loss and joint dynamic training with diffusion model, and uses offline fusion strategy for integration module to achieve deep multi-level semantic editing with minimal data lubrication.

Result: Achieves excellent results in IBench evaluation, meeting demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments.

Conclusion: EditIDv2 successfully addresses editability injection under minimal data lubrication, enabling effective character editing in complex narrative scenes with long text inputs while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

*Xiaomeng Zhu,Changwei Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xinyu Liu,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) using LLMs for Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation, improving both short-term and long-term prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Scene Graph Anticipation approaches struggle to integrate commonsense knowledge and lack long-term prediction robustness, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Decouples SGA into two steps: scene graph extraction from video, then pure text-based prediction using LLMs. Introduces OOTSM where LLM first forecasts object appearances/disappearances, then generates detailed human-object relations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3.4% improvement in short-term mean-Recall (@10) and dramatic 21.9% improvement in long-term mean-Recall (@50). Outperforms zero-shot APIs like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation using LLMs effectively leverages commonsense knowledge, significantly improving both short-term and long-term scene graph prediction performance.

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

TL;DR: Physics-inspired denoising models inspired by particle physics pileup mitigation show improved robustness at high noise levels compared to standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage physics principles from particle physics (conservation, locality, isolation) to create more robust image denoising models that maintain performance under strong corruption.

Method: Developed hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: conservation-constrained CNN, Gaussian-noise variants, and WIPUNet (Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network) that integrates physics priors into UNet architecture.

Result: PU-inspired CNNs competitive with standard baselines on CIFAR-10; WIPUNet shows widening performance margin at higher noise levels (σ=15-100). Same trend observed on BSD500, demonstrating physics priors provide stability where data-driven models degrade.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired inductive biases from particle physics can be successfully translated to image denoising, providing robustness gains at high noise levels without requiring heavy state-of-the-art machinery.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with multi-turn interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual reasoning, leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes CAMVR framework with Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) for storing visual-textual context and Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) for dynamic attention adjustment, plus multi-level reasoning integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, and novel MTIF dataset show CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CAMVR successfully addresses multi-turn visual reasoning challenges by maintaining contextual coherence and improving visual-textual inference capabilities.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: MeshMetrics is a mesh-based framework that provides more precise computation of distance-based segmentation metrics than conventional grid-based approaches, addressing implementation pitfalls that cause significant discrepancies in existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility crisis in image segmentation research is partly due to unreliable metric implementations, where distance-based metrics show considerable discrepancies between common open-source tools (e.g., >100mm for Hausdorff distance, >30%pt for normalized surface distance).

Method: Developed MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that computes distance-based metrics more precisely than grid-based approaches by reducing discretization artifacts like distance quantization.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation show MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts.

Conclusion: MeshMetrics provides a reliable solution for precise distance-based metric computation in segmentation evaluation and is released as an open-source Python package to improve reproducibility.

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR significantly improves both accuracy and interpretability in video action recognition by leveraging large language models' capabilities for semantic reasoning and natural language explanations.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

TL;DR: JRN-Geo is a novel cross-view geo-localization method that integrates RGB and normal images using dual-branch feature extraction with DAFM and JCIA modules, plus 3D geographic augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UAV localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely mainly on semantic features from RGB images and neglect spatial structural information, which is crucial for handling drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations in cross-view geo-localization.

Method: Proposes a joint perception network with dual-branch feature extraction (RGB + normal images), Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM), Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy, and 3D geographic augmentation for generating viewpoint variation samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets show robustness against complex viewpoint variations and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric structural information from normal images and using joint perception with deep fusion strategies significantly improves cross-view geo-localization performance for UAV applications.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T extends LiDAR-BIND with temporal consistency mechanisms for multi-modal sensor fusion, improving SLAM performance through temporal embedding alignment, motion-aligned transformation loss, and specialized temporal fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance temporal stability and coherence in multi-modal sensor fusion (radar, sonar to LiDAR translation) for improved robustness and performance in downstream SLAM applications.

Method: Three main contributions: temporal embedding similarity for latent space alignment, motion-aligned transformation loss for displacement matching, and window temporal fusion with specialized modules. Updated architecture to preserve spatial structure.

Result: Improved temporal and spatial coherence, lower absolute trajectory error, better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM. Enhanced robustness and performance for downstream SLAM tasks.

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially improving temporal stability, providing practical temporal quality indicators and better SLAM performance through explicit temporal consistency enforcement.

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-LVI-SAM is a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework that uses a panoramic visual feature model to unify multiple fisheye camera data into a single representation for improved state estimation accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate and robust state estimation by efficiently fusing data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR, and inertial sensors while addressing the challenges of multi-camera integration and triangulation inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation, uses extrinsic compensation to address frame misalignment issues, and integrates this into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system based on a factor graph.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the panoramic visual feature model enhances multi-camera constraint quality and consistency, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-LVI-SAM framework with panoramic visual feature modeling and extrinsic compensation effectively improves pose estimation accuracy and system robustness by providing consistent multi-view constraints and simplifying system design.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

*Tianhao Guo,Bingjie Lu,Feng Wang,Zhengyang Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel distance-adaptive super-resolution framework that addresses spatially-varying degradation in real-world imaging through variational formulation with depth-dependent pseudodifferential operators and neural architecture with depth-conditional convolution kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional super-resolution assumes spatially-invariant degradation, but real-world imaging exhibits complex distance-dependent effects like atmospheric scattering and depth-of-field variations, requiring spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies with geometric scene understanding.

Method: Variational framework formulating SR as spatially-varying inverse problem using pseudodifferential operators with distance-dependent spectral characteristics. Neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels and learned distance-adaptive regularization terms.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2× and 4× scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework, demonstrating significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance on traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

*Leo Ho,Yinghao Huang,Dafei Qin,Mingyi Shi,Wangpok Tse,Wei Liu,Junichi Yamagishi,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new multi-modal dataset called InterAct captures realistic two-person interactions with diverse motions and long-term patterns, along with a diffusion-based method for generating interactive body motions and facial expressions from speech inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works either focus on single persons or conversational gestures with constant body positions, but real interactions involve dynamic movements and longer durations that need to be captured and modeled.

Method: Captured 241 motion sequences of two people performing realistic scenarios for one minute or longer, with assigned roles and emotions. Developed a diffusion-based hierarchical method to regress body motions and proposed a fine-tuning mechanism for lip accuracy in facial expressions.

Result: Created the InterAct dataset with diverse complex motions and long-term interaction patterns. The proposed method effectively estimates interactive face expressions and body motions from speech inputs.

Conclusion: The InterAct dataset enables research on realistic two-person interactions, and the diffusion-based approach provides an effective solution for generating synchronized interactive behaviors from speech.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARSE-VOS is a training-free RVOS framework using LLMs for hierarchical text-video alignment, achieving SOTA results on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods struggle with complex compositional descriptions and aligning static text with dynamic visual content, especially for similar-looking objects with inconsistent motion.

Method: Parses language queries into structured commands, uses spatio-temporal grounding for candidate trajectories, and employs two-stage hierarchical identification (coarse motion reasoning + fine pose verification) with LLMs.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hierarchical coarse-to-fine reasoning approach with LLM-powered parsing effectively addresses complex RVOS challenges without requiring training.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

TL;DR: PictOBI-20k dataset for evaluating LMMs on visual decipherment of oracle bone characters, showing current models have limited visual reasoning and rely too much on language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oracle bone characters are crucial for understanding early human civilization, but current decipherment methods are limited by archaeological constraints and small corpus sizes. LMMs offer potential for visual decipherment but need proper evaluation.

Method: Created PictOBI-20k dataset with 20k OBC and real object images forming 15k+ multi-choice questions. Conducted subjective annotations to compare human-LMM visual reasoning consistency and tested general LMMs on visual decipherment tasks.

Result: General LMMs show preliminary visual decipherment skills but don't effectively use visual information - they're mostly limited by language priors rather than visual reasoning.

Conclusion: The dataset enables better evaluation and optimization of visual attention in OBC-oriented LMMs, highlighting the need for improved visual reasoning capabilities in current models.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available

*Jonathan Aellen,Florian Burkhardt,Thomas Vetter,Marcel Lüthi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose alignment is crucial for accurate partial shape reconstruction in medical imaging. This paper proposes an efficient method to adjust existing statistical shape models to target pose without original training data, improving reconstruction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point distribution models for partial shape reconstruction often overlook pose alignment between training data and target shapes, leading to biased solutions especially for small shape parts.

Method: An efficient preprocessing method that adjusts existing linear shape models to specific target pose without requiring original training data. The approach preserves computational efficiency while handling translations exactly and providing good approximations for small rotations.

Result: Significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance. The method exactly recovers aligned models for translations and provides good approximations for small rotations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables plug-and-play adaptation of existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines through a simple preprocessing step, making it widely applicable for improving partial shape reconstruction in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPillars: A two-stage 3D detection framework that improves PointPillars by enabling voxel-based feature learning from pseudo images and adopting effective two-stage detection with sparse scene context features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PointPillars is efficient but underperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors due to limitations in preserving precise 3D structures and difficulty adopting two-stage detection pipelines with 3D proposals.

Method: Introduces 3DPillars CNN architecture with separable voxel feature module for learning 3D voxel-based features from pseudo images using 2D convolutions, and RoI head with sparse scene context feature module for multi-scale feature aggregation.

Result: Achieves good compromise between speed and accuracy on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets, narrowing performance gaps with state-of-the-art methods while retaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes PointPillars' limitations and enables effective two-stage 3D detection using pseudo image representations, offering improved performance without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdCare-VLM is a specialized video-language model for medication adherence monitoring using tuberculosis patient videos, achieving 3.1-3.54% improvement over existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic diseases require strict medication adherence, but adherence is often compromised by patient behavior, high costs, and poor healthcare infrastructure. There's a need for automated visual monitoring systems to detect medication adherence patterns.

Method: Developed AdCare-VLM based on Video-LLaVA architecture, fine-tuned on 806 custom-annotated TB medication monitoring videos. Created LLM-TB-VQA dataset with positive/negative/ambiguous adherence cases. Correlated visual features (face visibility, medication, water intake, ingestion) with medical concepts.

Result: Outperformed parameter-efficient fine-tuning enabled VLM models (LLaVA-V1.5, Chat-UniVi) with absolute improvements of 3.1-3.54% across various configurations. Ablation studies and attention visualizations confirmed approach effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal VLM successfully integrates visual-linguistic representations for medication adherence monitoring, providing interpretable and improved performance for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAB is a novel camera-radar fusion model that uses backward projection with radar to reduce depth ambiguity, achieving state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance on nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-radar fusion methods either struggle with sparse BEV feature generation (forward projection) or suffer from depth ambiguity leading to false positives (backward projection).

Method: Uses backward projection that aggregates perspective view image features into BEV queries, combining dense but unreliable image depth with sparse yet precise radar occupancy to improve depth distinction. Introduces spatial cross-attention with radar context features.

Result: Achieves 62.4% NDS and 54.0% mAP on nuScenes dataset, state-of-the-art among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods.

Conclusion: CRAB effectively addresses depth ambiguity in backward projection by leveraging radar information, demonstrating superior 3D object detection performance through complementary sensor fusion.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing is challenging due to small imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements that demand reliable anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures: 1) 4-MS-SSIM structural similarity-based anomaly scoring for lightweight real-time detection, 2) Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features for high-sensitivity distribution shift monitoring.

Result: First method achieved ACC 0.903 (unsupervised) and 0.931 (supervised) with only 10% defective samples; second method achieved ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Both outperformed re-implemented baselines.

Conclusion: The complementary approaches provide reliable inline inspection and scalable post-production surveillance, offering a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments while meeting EU AI Act requirements.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score

yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems

### [56] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM extends SAM to generate multiple plausible segmentations by modeling segmentation distributions with latent variables, addressing annotation uncertainty in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM produces deterministic segmentations but fails to capture ambiguity in real-world tasks like medical imaging where multiple plausible segmentations exist due to annotation uncertainty and inter-expert variability.

Method: Incorporates latent variable space with variational training, integrating prior and posterior networks into SAM framework to modulate prompt embeddings with latent codes for diverse segmentation generation.

Result: Outperforms existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics, demonstrating ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement on LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset.

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM successfully models segmentation distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead, making it valuable for medical imaging applications with inherent annotation ambiguity.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dust storms pose health risks and reduce visibility, requiring quick detection from satellites to provide timely warnings and monitoring.

Method: 3D convolutional network that learns patterns across all 36 MODIS bands plus split thermal bands, with simple normalization and local filling for missing data handling. Improved version increases training speed 21x.

Result: Achieved ~0.92 accuracy with 0.014 mean squared error on 17 independent MODIS scenes. Strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges.

Conclusion: Joint band-and-space learning enables timely global dust detection; wider input windows or attention-based models could further improve edge detection.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures is crucial for cardiovascular disease research, but development is constrained by scarce annotated histopathological data.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet) on limited cardiovascular histology dataset with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor performance differences driven more by statistical noise than true algorithmic superiority.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarking practices are limited in low-data clinical settings, and performance rankings may not reflect meaningful clinical utility due to data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTCChat is a multi-temporal MLLM that improves bi-temporal satellite image analysis with specialized Change Extraction and Prompt Augmentation modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance in change captioning and visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for bi-temporal change analysis use simple image concatenation, which inadequately models temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes, limiting their effectiveness in applications like urban monitoring and disaster assessment.

Method: Proposes BTCChat with a Change Extraction module to capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes, and a Prompt Augmentation mechanism to enhance attention to spatial details by incorporating contextual clues into prompts.

Result: Experimental results show BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: BTCChat effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by better modeling temporal correlations and spatial changes, demonstrating superior performance in bi-temporal satellite image analysis.

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT is a multimodal deep learning framework that combines visual and skeletal data to classify musculoskeletal risk in athletes, achieving high accuracy (93.89%) and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing musculoskeletal risk assessment methods are limited to controlled settings and rely on single data types, failing in complex environments. Early risk detection is crucial for athlete injury prevention.

Method: Proposes ViSK-GAT framework with Residual Block and Lightweight Transformer Block, featuring Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM) for inter-modal feature refinement and Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM) for cross-modal alignment. Uses custom multimodal dataset with 8 risk categories based on Rapid Entire Body Assessment system.

Result: Achieved 93.55% validation accuracy, 93.89% test accuracy, 93.86% precision, 93.85% F1 score, 93% Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Low RMSE (0.1205) and MAE (0.0156). Outperformed nine transfer learning backbones.

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT advances AI implementation for musculoskeletal risk classification, enabling early interventions in sports through effective multimodal analysis of visual and skeletal data.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

*Ruiqi Shen,Haotian Wu,Wenjing Zhang,Jiangjing Hu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semantic image compression method using CLIP embeddings that achieves extreme compression (2-3*10^-3 bpp) while preserving semantic information across diverse tasks and distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging applications prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks, calling for advanced semantic compression paradigms.

Method: Proposes compressing CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information, leveraging the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models rather than traditional pixel reconstruction.

Result: Achieves average bit rate of approximately 2-3*10^-3 bits per pixel (less than 5% of mainstream approaches), maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, and exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and tasks.

Conclusion: The CLIP-based semantic compression method provides extreme compression efficiency while preserving semantic information and demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness across various applications and data distributions.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriPrompt is a novel framework that enhances CLIP's text representations by leveraging visual encoder features through attribute retrieval, dual-stream contrastive learning, and self-regularization to address limitations of current deep prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep text prompting approaches suffer from over-reliance on contrastive learning that prioritizes high-level semantics while neglecting fine-grained features, and use static prompts across all input categories without content-aware adaptation.

Method: Uses Attribute Retrieval module to cluster visual features from each CLIP layer, retrieve semantically similar prompts from a pool, and concatenate them to text encoder inputs. Implements Dual-stream Contrastive Learning for fine-grained alignment and Self-Regularization to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieves up to 7.37% improvement in base-to-novel setting across three benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods and strong cross-domain knowledge transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: AttriPrompt effectively addresses limitations of current deep prompting methods, making vision-language pre-trained models more viable for real-world implementation through enhanced fine-grained feature optimization and content-aware adaptation.

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

*Feng Wang,Zihao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CPS method to eliminate noise artifacts in SDE-based sampling for RL-enhanced Flow Matching models, enabling more accurate reward modeling and stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE-based sampling introduces noise artifacts that harm reward learning in RL-enhanced Flow Matching models for image/video generation.

Method: Draws inspiration from DDIM to reformulate sampling process with Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS) that eliminates noise artifacts while preserving stochasticity.

Result: CPS eliminates noise artifacts, enables more accurate reward modeling, and leads to faster and more stable convergence for RL optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed CPS method successfully addresses noise issues in SDE-based sampling, improving RL performance for Flow Matching models without compromising stochasticity requirements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) with cross-attention to fuse original and enhanced medical images, plus multi-scale boundary loss for better segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from noise, blurriness, and low contrast. Existing enhancement techniques may alter crucial diagnostic information, while conventional fusion methods fail to fully leverage both original and enhanced images.

Method: DIFM uses bidirectional cross-attention to attend to spatial information across original and enhanced images, refining features via global spatial attention. Also introduces multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction.

Result: Experimental results on ACDC and Synapse datasets show superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DIFM effectively exploits mutual complementary information from original and enhanced medical images, improving segmentation accuracy especially at object boundaries.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to

directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bloom lighting techniques rely on multiple blur operations and texture sampling with conditional branching, which consume significant computational resources and execution time, creating bottlenecks for real-time rendering.

Method: Proposed two neural network-based approaches: Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL) that generate brightness masks from 3D scene views using neural networks instead of traditional blur and sampling operations.

Result: Both methods outperform state-of-the-art bloom implementations, with FastNBL being 28% faster and NBL 12% faster, while maintaining high-quality bloom effects across various 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Neural network-based bloom lighting enables faster, more realistic bloom effects in real-time environments, saving computational resources and improving immersion in high FPS applications while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning method for medical 3D imaging that uses three interpretable sub-tasks to capture spatial semantics while maintaining performance comparable to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods in medical imaging lack interpretability and intuitive demonstration of 3D spatial learning, as they are based on 2D visual domain designs that don't adequately capture 3D spatial knowledge.

Method: Proposes three interpretable sub-tasks designed to capture spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging, incorporating multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability while ensuring observability principles.

Result: Experimental results show the approach delivers performance on par with current methodologies while providing intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses interpretability issues in medical 3D self-supervised learning while maintaining competitive performance through spatially-focused, observable sub-tasks.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

TL;DR: OmniStyle2 reframes style transfer as a data problem using destylization to create DST-100K dataset, then trains a simple FLUX-based model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the fundamental challenge of lacking ground-truth data in artistic style transfer by creating authentic supervision signals through destylization.

Method: Develops DST (text-guided destylization model) and DST-Filter (multi-stage evaluation with Chain-of-Thought reasoning) to build DST-100K dataset, then trains a simple feed-forward model based on FLUX.1-dev.

Result: OmniStyle2 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: Scalable data generation via destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm that overcomes the ground-truth data limitation in artistic style transfer.

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle is a novel domain generalization method that maps all samples to a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge domain gaps, achieving significant performance improvements especially with limited training domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Existing DG methods struggle with limited training domains or large gaps between seen and unseen domains.

Method: Proposes ConstStyle which leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features. All samples are mapped onto this unified domain during training, and unseen domain samples are projected similarly during testing to reduce domain shift impact.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. With limited seen domains, it boosts accuracy up to 19.82% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts by aligning training and testing data within a unified domain, demonstrating strong performance even with large domain gaps or few seen domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

TL;DR: STRIDE diffusion model for sparse-view CT reconstruction with temporal reweighting guidance and dual-network architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction by leveraging diffusion models' generative capabilities while handling missing projection views and maintaining structural consistency.

Method: Joint training with sparse conditional probabilities, temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance, linear regression for distribution correction, and dual-network parallel architecture for multi-frequency component optimization.

Result: Achieves best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, 2.37% increase in SSIM, and 0.236 reduction in MSE compared to baseline methods, with excellent generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: STRIDE effectively combines diffusion modeling with specialized guidance strategies for high-quality sparse-view CT reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative image quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

*Diana-Alexandra Sas,Florin Oniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled strategy using precomputed segmentation priors fused into feature space improves monocular 3D object detection, especially for small objects like pedestrians and cyclists, without expanding model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to lack of depth cues in single 2D images. Existing methods use CNNs or Transformers but struggle with depth estimation. The paper aims to leverage segmentation information to guide detection without model expansion.

Method: Inject precomputed segmentation information priors directly into feature space and fuse them to guide detection. Uses decoupled strategy without expanding detection model or jointly learning priors.

Result: Outperforms equivalent RGB-only architecture on KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, particularly for small objects (pedestrians and cyclists). Shows segmentation priors can balance need for additional sensors/training data.

Conclusion: Understanding input data through segmentation priors effectively improves monocular 3D detection performance without model expansion, demonstrating that better data understanding can compensate for hardware limitations.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that combines Vision Transformer features with optical flow motion cues for monocular 6-DoF spacecraft pose estimation, outperforming single-image baselines and showing good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing spacecraft pose estimation methods use single images with static keypoint localization, failing to utilize valuable temporal information available in space operations.

Method: Adapts human pose estimation framework to spacecraft domain by integrating motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow. Uses ViT encoder for image features combined with pre-trained optical flow model for motion cues to localize 2D keypoints, then applies PnP solver for 6-DoF pose recovery.

Result: Improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localization and 6-DoF pose estimation. Shows promising generalization capabilities when tested on different data distributions from SPADES-RGB and SPARK-2024 datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages temporal motion information through optical flow integration, demonstrating enhanced pose estimation accuracy and robust generalization across real and synthetic spacecraft data.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Conclusion: Khana successfully addresses the critical gap in Indian food image datasets and serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing food recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and meal planning applications specific to Indian cuisine.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark

### [74] [BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06010)
*Wanyin Cheng,Zanxi Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT is a VQA framework that handles ambiguous questions from blind/low vision users by generating diverse answers, grounding them spatially, and using chain-of-thought reasoning to assess answer consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLV users often take blurry photos and ask ambiguous questions, leading to multiple valid answers that conventional VQA systems can't handle due to their single-answer assumption.

Method: Uses LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 for diverse answer generation, PolyFormer for spatial grounding of each answer, and chain-of-thought reasoning to determine if answers refer to same/different regions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark and proves more robust to ambiguity and visual noise in assistive settings.

Conclusion: VQA systems need to adapt to human uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users, with BLaVe-CoT demonstrating effective handling of ambiguous visual questions.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed UAV-specific datasets and cross-attention fusion module to bridge domain gap in open-vocabulary object detection for aerial imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVD models trained on ground-level images suffer performance degradation on UAV imagery due to significant domain gap.

Method: Developed UAV-Label engine to create UAVDE-2M (2M+ instances, 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k datasets, plus Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion module integrated with YOLO-World-v2.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone and SIMD datasets verified effectiveness for UAV-based imagery and remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed datasets and CAGE module successfully address the domain gap issue in open-vocabulary object detection for aerial imagery.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

*Zhiwen Shao,Yifan Cheng,Fan Zhang,Xuehuai Shi,Canlin Li,Lizhuang Ma,Dit-yan Yeung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel fine-grained dynamic perception framework for facial micro-expression recognition that ranks frame features chronologically to capture dynamic information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial micro-expression recognition is challenging due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions. Existing methods either rely on hand-crafted features requiring key frames or deep networks that suffer from small-scale, low-diversity training data.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained dynamic perception framework that ranks frame-level features in chronological order to encode dynamic information. Uses a local-global feature-aware transformer for frame representation, a rank scorer for frame scores, and temporal pooling for dynamic representation. Includes a dynamic image construction module to capture subtle facial actions and alleviate data scarcity.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving by 4.05% on CASME II, 2.50% on SAMM, 7.71% on CAS(ME)^2, and 2.11% on CAS(ME)^3 in terms of F1-score. Also works well for dynamic image construction.

Conclusion: The proposed FDP framework effectively addresses the challenges of micro-expression recognition by capturing both appearance and motion dynamics through chronological ranking and benefits from the auxiliary dynamic image construction task for improved performance.

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D successfully addresses the limitations of traditional visual-LiDAR odometry methods through sparse spatial-temporal fusion, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and real-time capabilities for autonomous system localization.

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse

Conclusion: Integrating detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO methods for aligning generative models with human preferences suffer from high computational costs due to on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability from sparse rewards.

Method: Proposes BranchGRPO with three key components: 1) branch sampling policy that updates SDE sampling process, 2) tree-based advantage estimator with dense process-level rewards, and 3) pruning strategies for path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence.

Result: Experiments show BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines while reducing training time by 50%.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO effectively addresses computational efficiency and training stability issues in generative model alignment, achieving better performance with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Motivation: High-fidelity CFD modeling is accurate but computationally expensive and requires expert knowledge, while conventional GNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in high-resolution thermal-fluid simulations.

Method: A novel multi-stage GNN architecture that uses hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales, evaluated on a new CFD dataset of natural convection in rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios.

Result: The proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art GNN baselines.

Conclusion: The multi-stage GNN approach shows strong potential for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations, offering an efficient alternative to traditional CFD methods.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph

architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat

Motivation: To improve reconstruction quality in projection-based nano- and microtomography, particularly for specimens composed of homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges, where traditional methods often produce blurriness and artifacts.

Method: Train a neural network to identify edges within subpictures, then integrate it into a mathematical optimization model that favors solutions according to learned predictions while allowing alternative solutions strongly supported by raw data.

Result: Significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms on experimental datasets, with successful elimination of blurriness.

Conclusion: The technique successfully incorporates knowledge about homogeneity and sharp edges, producing high-quality reconstructions and showcasing potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw

homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements

### [84] [MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096)
*Yiwen Ye,Yicheng Wu,Xiangde Luo,He Zhang,Ziyang Chen,Ting Dang,Yanning Zhang,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeqFT is a sequential fine-tuning framework for medical image segmentation that preserves pre-trained knowledge while adapting to new tasks, outperforming existing methods by 3.0% Dice score on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning strategies for medical image analysis either isolate tasks (parallel fine-tuning) or require simultaneous access to all datasets (multi-task fine-tuning), failing to effectively handle incremental task integration and knowledge retention.

Method: Proposes MedSeqFT with two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection to identify representative downstream samples, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT) using LoRA-based knowledge distillation to balance task adaptation with knowledge retention.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies across ten 3D segmentation tasks with average 3.0% Dice improvement. Enhances transferability on unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney), particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses confirm robustness.

Conclusion: MedSeqFT establishes sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pathological image analysis is challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle morphological variations. Current VL models fail to capture complex reasoning needed for interpreting structured pathological reports.

Method: Proposed PathoHR-Bench benchmark for evaluating hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning. Introduced pathology-specific VL training scheme with enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Conclusion: The proposed pathology-specific training scheme effectively addresses VL models' limitations in capturing intricate cross-modal relationships, making them more applicable in clinical settings for automated tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

### [86] [CARDIE: clustering algorithm on relevant descriptors for image enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06116)
*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARDIE is an unsupervised image clustering algorithm that groups images by color and luminosity content, producing clusters more relevant for image enhancement tasks than semantic-based clustering. It also includes a method to quantify enhancement algorithm impact on luminance distribution and local variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic image clustering has limited application in image enhancement due to difficulty defining meaningful clusters for this specific task. Current approaches using semantic image attributes don't produce optimal clusters for enhancement purposes.

Method: CARDIE clusters images based on color and luminosity content rather than semantic attributes. The method also quantifies the impact of enhancement algorithms on luminance distribution and local variance. The clusters are used to resample image enhancement datasets.

Result: CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than semantic-based clustering. Using CARDIE clusters for dataset resampling leads to improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms.

Conclusion: CARDIE provides an effective unsupervised approach for image clustering specifically tailored for enhancement tasks, outperforming semantic-based methods. The code is publicly released to encourage adoption and ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

### [87] [SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122)
*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D is a transformer-based model that generates high-quality hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while preserving both spatial and spectral fidelity, outperforming previous methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental trade-off in remote sensing: multispectral imagery has high spatial resolution but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery has rich spectral information but lower spatial resolution. Existing methods struggle to jointly preserve both spatial detail and spectral fidelity.

Method: SpecSwin3D uses a 3D shifted-window transformer framework that takes 5 multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same spatial resolution. It employs a cascade training strategy that progressively expands the spectral range, and uses an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and orders the input bands to capture pairwise relations.

Result: The model achieves PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40°, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. It also demonstrates practical value on downstream tasks like land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D effectively bridges the gap between multispectral and hyperspectral imagery by generating high-fidelity hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs, with significant improvements over existing methods and practical applications in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

TL;DR: Lightweight token pruning framework for vision-language models that filters non-informative background regions from document images to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show impressive document understanding capabilities but have high computational demands that need to be mitigated.

Method: A binary patch-level classifier removes non-text areas, followed by a max-pooling refinement step to recover fragmented text regions and enhance spatial coherence.

Result: Experiments on real-world document datasets show substantial reduction in computational costs while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed token pruning framework effectively reduces compute burdens for VLMs in document understanding tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

*Zhengquan Luo,Chi Liu,Dongfu Xiao,Zhen Yu,Yueye Wang,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinaGuard is a privacy-enhancing framework that protects retinal age information in fundus images while maintaining diagnostic utility through adversarial masking and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI can extract sensitive biometric data like retinal age from medical images, creating privacy risks where unauthorized use could lead to bioinformation leakage and privacy breaches.

Method: Feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure retinal age, combined with multiple-to-one knowledge distillation using retinal foundation model and diverse surrogate age encoders for universal defense against black-box age prediction models.

Result: Successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image quality and pathological feature representation, providing effective privacy protection.

Conclusion: RetinaGuard offers a flexible privacy-enhancing solution for medical images that can be extended to protect other image-derived biomarkers while preserving diagnostic utility.

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

*Duomin Wang,Wei Zuo,Aojie Li,Ling-Hao Chen,Xinyao Liao,Deyu Zhou,Zixin Yin,Xili Dai,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse-1 is a unified model that generates coordinated audio and video using stitching of experts technique, avoiding training from scratch by fusing pre-trained video and music generation models with online annotation for accurate temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model capable of simultaneous audio-video generation with coordinated outputs, addressing the performance degradation caused by misaligned text-based annotations in existing approaches.

Method: Uses stitching of experts (SoE) technique to fuse blocks of pre-trained video and music generation models, combined with an online annotation pipeline for accurate temporal alignment of audio (ambient sounds and speech) with video content during training.

Result: After fine-tuning on ~7,600 hours of audio-video data, the model produces well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. Introduces Verse-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generates coordinated audio-video content and closes the performance gap with state-of-the-art models like Veo3. The model and code are made publicly available to advance audio-video generation research.

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

*Huy Le,Nhat Chung,Tung Kieu,Jingkang Yang,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO is a unified single-stage framework for both box-level and pixel-level Video Scene Graph Generation that uses object-centric slot attention and temporal consistency learning without explicit tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VidSGG methods require separate architectures for different granularity levels (box vs pixel) and multi-stage training, lacking a unified approach.

Method: Extended slot attention decomposes features into object/relation slots, object temporal consistency enforces frame-to-frame consistency without tracking, and dynamic triplet prediction links relations to object pairs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks while offering improved efficiency through unified design.

Conclusion: UNO demonstrates that a single unified framework can effectively handle multiple VidSGG tasks with minimal task-specific modifications and maximum parameter sharing.

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based automated fracture detection from X-ray images using custom CNN achieves 95.96% accuracy, outperforming transfer learning models in this specific study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited access to expert radiology services in low-resource settings and overcome limitations of conventional imaging methods (high costs, radiation exposure, specialized interpretation dependency).

Method: Developed custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked against transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) using FracAtlas dataset of 4,083 musculoskeletal radiographs.

Result: Custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and 0.91 F1-score. Transfer learning models performed poorly in this setup, potentially due to class imbalance and dataset limitations.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs show promise for fracture detection in X-rays, but require fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient document detection pipeline using adapted IWPOD-Net for real-time document detection and rectification, achieving competitive OCR quality with smaller model size than state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time document detection and rectification is an unexplored niche but vital for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. Current approaches focus on either performance with larger models or efficiency with smaller models, but not both for this specific application.

Method: Adapted IWPOD-Net (license plate detection network) for document detection, trained on synthetic ID card dataset (NBID). Used data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV dataset. Evaluated OCR quality using Levenshtein distance metric after document rectification.

Result: The model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while maintaining competitive OCR quality. Document rectification doesn't need to be perfect to achieve state-of-the-art performance scores.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient document detection pipeline that balances performance and efficiency for real-time document processing, demonstrating that perfect rectification isn't necessary for optimal OCR results.

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ego3D-Bench is a new benchmark with 8,600+ QA pairs for evaluating VLMs' 3D spatial reasoning using ego-centric multi-view outdoor data. Current VLMs show significant performance gap vs humans. Ego3D-VLM framework improves spatial reasoning by 12-56% using cognitive maps from estimated 3D coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have limited 3D spatial understanding, while real-world embodied AI agents (robots, self-driving cars) rely on ego-centric multi-view observations. Existing spatial QA datasets use single images or indoor videos, not matching real-world outdoor scenarios.

Method: Created Ego3D-Bench with 8,600+ human-annotated QA pairs from ego-centric multi-view outdoor data. Proposed Ego3D-VLM post-training framework that generates cognitive maps based on estimated global 3D coordinates to enhance spatial reasoning.

Result: Benchmarked 16 SOTA VLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, etc.) showing notable performance gap vs human level. Ego3D-VLM achieved 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation.

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM provide valuable tools for advancing toward human-level spatial understanding in real-world multi-view environments. Current VLMs still fall short but the proposed framework shows significant improvements.

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First study to estimate skin hydration and trans-epidermal water loss from selfie facial images using AI, enabling remote skin barrier assessment without specialized instruments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin barrier function is crucial for health but requires specialized clinic equipment to measure SH and TEWL, making regular monitoring inaccessible to general users.

Method: Developed a systematic solution with data collection, preprocessing, and a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model with symmetric-based contrastive regularization to address data imbalance.

Result: Successfully estimated SH and TEWL from selfie images, overcoming annotation imbalance issues and enabling remote skin assessment.

Conclusion: Bridges computer vision and skincare research, enabling AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications without physical measurements.

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML is a novel framework that addresses limitations in open-vocabulary visual grounding through prototype-aware multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based VG methods perform well in standard scenes but struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to imperfect visual-linguistic alignment, insufficient cross-modal fusion, and ineffective use of semantic prototypes.

Method: Uses ALBEF for initial cross-modal alignment, Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder for salient object enhancement, prototype discovering/inheriting mechanism for semantic aggregation, and Multi-stage Decoder for comprehensive multimodal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show competitive performance in standard scenes and state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scenes.

Conclusion: PAML effectively addresses key challenges in open-vocabulary visual grounding through systematic multimodal learning and prototype utilization, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Result: Achieves SoTA performance with absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN benchmarks, plus substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity.

Conclusion: Interleaving reasoning significantly enhances text-to-image generation quality, instruction following, and detail preservation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the IRG framework and training approach.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video-GCD, extending Generalized Category Discovery to videos, with a Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning framework that leverages temporal-spatial cues for better novel category discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static images alone are insufficient for reliable novel category discovery. Videos provide multi-perspective temporal information that can significantly improve Generalized Category Discovery performance.

Method: MCCL framework with two components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) that weights contrastive loss using temporal consistency scores, and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE) with dual-level memory buffer for feature and logit representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms image-based GCD approaches on new Video-GCD benchmark including action recognition and bird classification datasets, demonstrating the importance of temporal information.

Conclusion: Temporal information is crucial for discovering novel categories in videos, and the proposed MCCL framework effectively integrates multi-perspective temporal cues through consistency-aware contrastive learning and memory-guided enhancement.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text4Seg++ introduces a text-as-mask paradigm that formulates image segmentation as a text generation problem using semantic descriptors, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively integrating image segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains challenging, requiring a simpler approach that eliminates additional decoders.

Method: Proposes semantic descriptors as textual representations of segmentation masks, with image-wise and box-wise variants. Uses Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE) for compression and formulates segmentation as next-brick prediction.

Result: Achieves strong segmentation performance across diverse vision tasks, reduces descriptor length by 74%, accelerates inference by 3x, and outperforms SOTA models without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The text-driven approach demonstrates effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability for image segmentation within MLLM frameworks while maintaining compatibility with existing backbones.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper

quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GO-Tokenizer improves video understanding by encoding object information directly into Video-LLMs using object detectors, avoiding text description limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-sensitive video understanding benefits from grounded object information, but textual descriptions add token overhead and noise susceptibility.

Method: Propose GO-Tokenizer - a lightweight add-on module that uses off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly.

Result: Pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms vanilla Video-LLM and text-based object description approaches across models, datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: Direct object encoding via GO-Tokenizer effectively enhances video understanding capabilities without text description drawbacks.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP-FAS is a novel face anti-spoofing framework that enhances CLIP-based methods by using multi-view slot attention and multi-text patch alignment with paraphrased texts to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based face anti-spoofing methods underutilize patch embeddings and rely on single text prompts per class, limiting their ability to detect spoofing clues and generalize across domains.

Method: Proposes MVP-FAS with two modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) to extract detailed spatial features from patch embeddings using diverse texts, and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA) to align patches with multiple text representations for semantic robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing CLIP-based FAS methods by leveraging multiple text perspectives and better patch utilization, demonstrating improved cross-domain anti-spoofing capabilities.

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Motivation: Traditional colorectal disease diagnosis requires separate evaluations of histological images and colonoscopy footage, leading to variability and inefficiencies in the diagnostic process.

Method: Proposes a unified CNN-based pipeline using ResNet-50 architecture that processes both histopathology images from PathMNIST dataset and colonoscopy video frames from HyperKvasir dataset, with integrated class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration methods.

Result: The study demonstrates an interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that successfully unifies multiple diagnostic modalities for colorectal disease detection.

Conclusion: This unified deep learning approach advances and eases colorectal disease detection by combining multiple diagnostic modalities into a single efficient pipeline, potentially reducing variability and improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Motivation: Traditional drought detection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while existing deep learning models require too many parameters for resource-limited agricultural settings.

Method: Proposed a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures, incorporating a gradient norm-based machine unlearning mechanism for targeted data influence removal.

Result: Achieved 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models while maintaining competitive accuracy on aerial potato field imagery.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, especially suitable for resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive or superior performance across integer and non-integer scale factors with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed SAAM module provides a practical solution for robust multi-scale upscaling in real-world scenarios by retrofitting existing SR models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for analyzing brain metastases response to stereotactic radiosurgery using longitudinal MRI data, identifying 5 growth trajectories and achieving up to 0.90 AUC for response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain metastases contribute significantly to cancer mortality, but analyzing longitudinal MRI follow-up images is time-consuming for clinicians, limiting systematic quantification and early treatment response assessment.

Method: Implemented automated pipeline to curate longitudinal dataset of 896 brain metastases in 177 patients. Used data-driven clustering to identify growth trajectories and employed both classical gradient boosting and graph machine learning for 12-month response prediction.

Result: Identified 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct response categories. Achieved 0.90 AUC using pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI with gradient boosting, and 0.88 AUC with graph machine learning for flexible multi-timepoint configurations.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables automated, precise assessment and prediction of brain metastases response to SRS, facilitating scalable data curation and laying foundation for clinical decision support systems for personalized care.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for limited camera movement scenes with improved quantization using spherical coordinates to reduce projection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS works well for full 6DoF but has limitations when camera positions are constrained to small offsets around a central point (3DoF+ scenario), particularly with quantization errors that increase projection errors for distant points.

Method: Proposed a new quantization scheme using spherical coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates, analyzing the relationship between position error and projection error which is proportional to squared inverse distance.

Result: The spherical coordinate quantization method shows improved rate-distortion performance, demonstrated on the Garden scene benchmark.

Conclusion: Spherical coordinate quantization provides better performance for 3DoF+ scenarios in 3D Gaussian Splatting by reducing projection errors, especially for distant points in large scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

### [111] [Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object Detection with Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06422)
*Hua Zhang,Changjiang Luo,Ruoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight is a novel VCOD method combining SAM and MLLM to address edge separation and object-background separability issues in video camouflaged object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods struggle with separating camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, while MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as they merge foreground and background information.

Method: Uses temporal and spatial clues for video representation, performs feature fusion via LLM, employs dynamic foreground visual token scoring and prompt network to guide SAM, and implements decoupled foreground-background learning strategy with separate cue generation and training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoCA-Mask dataset across various metrics and demonstrates strong generalization by detecting unseen camouflaged objects on CAD2016 dataset.

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight effectively addresses key limitations in VCOD by enhancing edge detail separability and object-background distinction through innovative integration of SAM and MLLM with decoupled learning strategies.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

*Rabin Dulal,Lihong Zheng,Muhammad Ashad Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot cattle muzzle detection using Grounding DINO vision-language model achieves 76.8% mAP@0.5 without annotated training data, providing an annotation-free alternative to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional muzzle detection methods require extensive annotated datasets and are data-dependent, limiting performance on new cattle. Manual detection is labor-intensive and inconsistent.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot framework using Grounding DINO vision-language model that leverages natural language prompts for muzzle detection without task-specific training or annotated data.

Result: Achieves 76.8% mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, demonstrating promising performance without requiring annotated training data.

Conclusion: First annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection that offers practical alternative to supervised methods with improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

*Yixiao Li,Xiaoyuan Yang,Guanghui Yue,Jun Fu,Qiuping Jiang,Xu Jia,Paul L. Rosin,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PBAN is a novel full-reference image quality assessment method for super-resolution images that uses bidirectional attention and perception-oriented modules to better evaluate distorted information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing full-reference image quality assessment metrics for comparing super-resolution algorithms are limited, and current attention-based methods don't adequately capture the bidirectional nature of SR image generation and evaluation.

Method: Three-module architecture: image encoder, perception-oriented bidirectional attention module (with Bidirectional Attention, Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, and Sub-information Excitation Convolution), and quality prediction module for feature integration and score regression.

Result: Extensive experiments show PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PBAN framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing SR IQA methods by incorporating human visual system characteristics and bidirectional attention mechanisms for superior performance.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

TL;DR: Cross-source point cloud registration framework using visual-geometric attention and overlap prediction to handle multi-sensor data differences, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-source point cloud registration faces challenges due to lack of large-scale real-world datasets and inherent sensor differences that negatively impact feature extraction and matching accuracy.

Method: Constructed Cross3DReg dataset from mechanical and semi-solid-state lidars. Designed overlap-based framework using unaligned images to predict overlapping regions, with visual-geometric attention guided matching to fuse image and geometric information for reliable correspondences.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: reduced relative rotation error by 63.2%, relative translation error by 40.2%, and improved registration recall by 5.4%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-source registration challenges by filtering redundant points and enhancing feature consistency through visual-geometric fusion, demonstrating accurate and robust performance.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

*Sebastian-Vasile Echim,Andrei-Alexandru Preda,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel black-box adversarial attack algorithms (ATA and AGA) that use affine transformations and genetic algorithms to achieve up to 8.82% better attack success rates than existing methods on various CNN and transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are dominant but hard to understand and exhibit surprising weaknesses. Adversarial attacks help uncover these vulnerabilities, especially challenging in black-box scenarios where model details are inaccessible.

Method: Developed two black-box iterative adversarial algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA) using random affine transformations to maximize attack score, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA) combining random noise and affine transformations. Tested on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer using Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets.

Result: Achieved better results than similar methods (Pixle and Square Attack) with up to 8.82% accuracy improvement. Provided insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels.

Conclusion: The proposed ATA and AGA algorithms demonstrate superior performance in black-box adversarial attacks, offering valuable insights for improving adversarial robustness through parameter variation and effective attack strategies.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

TL;DR: CARVE is a training-free method that improves VLM performance in complex visual environments by contrasting attention maps to extract task-relevant signals from visual noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs degrade in complex visual environments, and existing enhancement approaches require additional training or external tools while overlooking VLMs' innate attention capabilities.

Method: Analyze VLM attention patterns, discover correlation between visual complexity and attention entropy, and propose Contrastive Attention Refinement (CARVE) - a training-free method that contrasts general vs task-specific attention maps at pixel level to decompose visual signals.

Result: CARVE consistently enhances performance with up to 75% improvement on open-source models without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning through attention contrasting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

TL;DR: First statistical 3D stomach shape model combining synthetic data generation with real CT scan validation for robust anatomical variability capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of detailed 3D stomach models due to data scarcity and methodological challenges in capturing anatomical variability for medical applications.

Method: Novel pipeline for synthetic 3D stomach generation, statistical shape modeling in low-dimensional space, and semi-supervised alignment with real CT meshes from public datasets.

Result: Model demonstrates robust generalization and fit accuracy on held-out test set of real stomach CT scans, with publicly available dataset and model.

Conclusion: First comprehensive statistical 3D stomach shape model enabling applications in surgical simulation, pre-operative planning, medical education, and personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3, a self-supervised vision transformer trained on natural images, shows impressive performance as a unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training, outperforming medical-specific models in some cases but showing limitations in highly specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art vision foundation models like DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, can effectively transfer to specialized medical imaging domains without additional domain-specific training.

Method: Benchmark DINOv3 across various medical vision tasks (2D/3D classification and segmentation) on multiple imaging modalities, systematically analyzing scalability by varying model sizes and input resolutions.

Result: DINOv3 establishes strong performance baselines, outperforming medical-specific models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks despite natural image training. However, it shows limitations in highly specialized domains (WSIs, EM, PET) and inconsistent scaling behavior in medical applications.

Conclusion: DINOv3 serves as a powerful baseline and robust visual prior for medical tasks, opening future directions like leveraging its features for 3D reconstruction consistency, though domain-specific limitations exist.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSG-Net is a novel frequency-spatial synergistic network that addresses false alarms and semantic gaps in high-resolution remote sensing change detection by adaptively processing frequency components and selectively fusing features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two critical challenges in change detection: false alarms from radiometric variations (illumination, season) and semantic gaps between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features that lead to poorly delineated boundaries.

Method: Proposes FSG-Net with three key components: 1) Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) for frequency-domain processing to mitigate pseudo-changes, 2) Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM) to amplify genuine change regions in spatial domain, and 3) Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) to bridge semantic gap by selectively integrating details from shallow layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CDD (94.16% F1), GZ-CD (89.51% F1), and LEVIR-CD (91.27% F1) benchmarks, demonstrating superior change detection capabilities.

Conclusion: FSG-Net effectively disentangles semantic changes from nuisance variations through frequency-spatial synergistic processing and gated fusion, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach for high-resolution remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Before-After Supervision for waste sorting automation, using visual differences between before/after operator actions to train segmentation networks without extensive labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human operators are still essential for waste sorting but fully supervised computer vision requires extensive labeling. Weakly supervised alternatives using operator removal actions are under-explored.

Method: Introduces Before-After Supervision concept and WS^2 dataset with 11,000+ high-resolution frames. Presents end-to-end pipeline to benchmark weakly supervised segmentation methods.

Result: Created first multiview dataset for waste sorting with before/after images. Developed framework to train segmentation networks using implicit supervision from operator actions.

Conclusion: Before-After Supervision offers viable alternative to fully supervised approaches for industrial quality control, reducing labeling efforts while leveraging natural operator actions.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

TL;DR: TIDE framework enables subject-driven image generation by balancing subject identity preservation with instruction compliance through target-supervised triplet alignment and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately address the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions in subject-driven image generation.

Method: TIDE uses target-supervised triplet alignment with (reference image, instruction, target images) triplets and Direct Subject Diffusion objective, training with paired "winning" (balanced) and "losing" (distorted) targets for implicit reward modeling.

Result: TIDE outperforms baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics, demonstrating superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance.

Conclusion: TIDE provides an effective framework for subject-driven image generation without test-time fine-tuning, with versatility across diverse tasks including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RANO criteria for glioblastoma response assessment are complex and subjective, requiring automated objective methods

Method: Hybrid framework combining ResNet-18 deep features with 4800+ radiomic and clinical features including 3D tumor masks, volumetric changes, and centroid shift, classified with CatBoost

Result: Mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and Macro F1 score of 0.50 in 4-class response prediction (Complete/Partial Response, Stable/Progressive Disease)

Conclusion: Combining learned image representations with domain-specific radiomic features provides robust automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: Reproducibility study of FairCLIP shows it fails to improve fairness or performance in zero-shot glaucoma classification despite reducing Sinkhorn distances, contrary to original claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reproducibility of FairCLIP's claims about improving group fairness in CLIP models for medical image classification tasks.

Method: Reproduced FairCLIP experimental setup, identified discrepancies in model description, created aligned implementation A-FairCLIP, proposed FairCLIP+ extension for multiple attributes, and tested on Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.

Result: CLIP shows demographic bias in zero-shot glaucoma classification, but FairCLIP (both original and aligned versions) does not improve performance or fairness despite reducing Sinkhorn distance disparities.

Conclusion: The original FairCLIP claims are not supported by experimental evidence; the regularization objective reduces distance metrics but fails to translate to actual fairness or performance improvements in medical classification tasks.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.

minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

*Senem Aktas,Charles Markham,John McDonald,Rozenn Dahyot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMOX, a JSON metadata format with ground truth information for Fast Moving Objects (FMO) datasets, and shows that EfficientTAM foundational model performs comparably to specialized FMO tracking pipelines using TIoU evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and tiny object tracking remains challenging in computer vision, and there's a need for standardized metadata formats to facilitate better evaluation and comparison of tracking methods on FMO datasets.

Method: The authors create FMOX JSON metadata files with additional ground truth information (including object size) for four open source FMO datasets, then test the EfficientTAM foundational tracking model using these enhanced datasets with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) evaluation.

Result: EfficientTAM performs comparably well with pipelines specifically designed for FMO datasets, demonstrating that foundational models can be effective for fast moving object tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The FMOX format provides accessible and usable metadata for machine learning pipelines processing FMO datasets, and foundational tracking models like EfficientTAM show promising performance on these challenging tracking tasks.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

*Emil Demić,Luka Čehovin Zajc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust training approach for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval that handles sketch ambiguity and noise without complex architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inherent ambiguity and noise in real-world sketches that previous work overlooked, focusing on making retrieval models robust to sketch variability rather than complex architectural augmentations.

Method: Combination of appropriate pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation specifically designed to be robust to sketch variability, without introducing additional complexity.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging FS-COCO and widely-used SketchyCOCO datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the training design approach.

Conclusion: Training design plays a critical role in cross-modal retrieval tasks, and there's a need to improve evaluation scenarios for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval.

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

*Runqing Yang,Yimin Fu,Changyuan Wu,Zhunga Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RARL method for incremental open set recognition that maintains decision boundaries by aligning unknown representations around inactive prototypes in angular space, using virtual classes and stratified rectification to handle evolving data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSR methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed scopes, but real-world applications require models to incrementally identify new unknown classes from continuous data streams while maintaining discriminative boundaries.

Method: Retentive Angular Representation Learning (RARL) with Virtual-Intrinsic Interactive training strategy that compacts known representations using boundary-proximal virtual classes, and stratified rectification to refine decision boundaries and mitigate representation bias.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets across various task setups, establishing a new benchmark for Incremental Open Set Recognition.

Conclusion: RARL effectively addresses the challenge of maintaining discriminative decision boundaries in evolving open set scenarios by leveraging angular space representation and strategic boundary refinement techniques.

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Machine learning approach to learn reduced ordering approximating Condorcet ranking for vector-valued morphological operators in color image processing


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of consensus on suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators in vector-valued images like color and hyperspectral images

Method: Develop machine learning approach that learns a reduced ordering approximating Condorcet ranking derived from a set of vector orderings, inspired by voting problems

Result: Preliminary computational experiments confirm effectiveness of learning reduced mapping for defining vector-valued morphological operators in color images

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach successfully approximates Condorcet ordering and provides effective vector ordering for morphological operators in color image processing

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

*Xin Kong,Daniel Watson,Yannick Strümpler,Michael Niemeyer,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausNVS is an autoregressive multi-view diffusion model for 3D novel view synthesis that supports flexible input-output view configurations and sequential generation, addressing limitations of non-autoregressive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view diffusion models are non-autoregressive, limiting them to fixed view counts and suffering from slow inference due to simultaneous denoising of all frames. This restricts their applicability in world modeling scenarios.

Method: Proposes CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise training, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference, employs spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to prevent drift.

Result: CausNVS supports broad camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The autoregressive formulation with causal masking and sequential generation overcomes limitations of non-autoregressive approaches, making multi-view diffusion more practical for world modeling applications with flexible view configurations.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

*Ritwik Kulkarni,WU Hanqin,Enrico Di Minin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning models developed to automatically detect illegal wildlife products (elephant ivory, pangolin scales/claws, tiger skins/bones) in images with 84.2% overall accuracy, deployed via smartphone app for real-time monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major biodiversity threat, increasingly occurring in digital marketplaces. Automated detection methods are needed to handle the large volume of digital content and identify wildlife products like ivory.

Method: Developed machine learning-based object recognition models using images of confiscated/sold illegal wildlife products. Tested various training strategies and loss functions, creating both species-specific models and a combined model for all three species.

Result: Best model achieved 84.2% overall accuracy with species-specific accuracies: 71.1% (elephants), 90.2% (pangolins), 93.5% (tigers). Smartphone application version showed 91.3% overall accuracy for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The method is effective for monitoring both online and physical wildlife trade, with practical deployment through smartphone apps for stakeholders like law enforcement agencies to identify prohibited wildlife products in real time.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

*Yichao Liu,YueYang Teng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSANet - a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network for LDCT/PET denoising that combines Efficient Global Attention modules and hybrid upsampling to improve image quality while maintaining low radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT and PET imaging reduce radiation exposure but result in increased noise and artifacts that compromise diagnostic accuracy, creating a need for effective denoising methods.

Method: Proposes HSANet with Efficient Global Attention modules for enhanced spatial/channel interaction and a hybrid upsampling module to prevent overfitting to noise.

Result: HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods while maintaining lightweight model size suitable for standard GPU deployment.

Conclusion: The approach is highly practical for real-world clinical applications, providing effective denoising for low-dose imaging while preserving diagnostic quality.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

### [131] [Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625)
*Aswini Kumar Patra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel deep learning framework using CNN-LSTM with multiple imaging modalities achieves 98% accuracy in classifying nitrogen stress severity under combined stress conditions (drought + weed competition).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plants face multiple interacting stresses in nature, making nitrogen deficiency detection challenging when compounded with drought and weed competition. Early detection is crucial for effective plant health management.

Method: Spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline combining CNN for spatial feature extraction from RGB, multispectral, and infrared images with LSTM for temporal dependencies. Also developed spatial-only CNN for comparison.

Result: CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved 98% accuracy, significantly outperforming spatial-only model (80.45%) and previous machine learning methods (76%).

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM approach effectively captures complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure, providing a robust platform for timely nitrogen stress identification and improved crop management.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Emma J Curtis,Samuel Simmons,Kazunori Nagano,Stan Brown,Adam Riese,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Location-based regularization improves self-supervised learning for seafloor image analysis, with CNNs benefiting most from low-dimensional representations and ViTs showing strong generalization with high-dimensional features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance marine monitoring efficiency by improving high-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor imagery through location-based regularization of self-supervised learning methods.

Method: Evaluated impact of location-based regularization on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks (CNN and ViT models) across three diverse seafloor image datasets with varying latent-space dimensionality.

Result: Location-regularization consistently improved downstream classification performance: average F1-score gains of 4.9±4.0% for CNNs and 6.3±8.9% for ViTs. CNNs benefited most from low-dimensional representations, while ViTs showed strong generalization with high-dimensional features.

Conclusion: Location metadata provides valuable regularization for SSL, particularly effective with low-dimensional latent representations, while high-dimensional ViTs demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities for seafloor image analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Sam Fenton,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online clustering framework for real-time unsupervised seafloor image analysis that adapts to continuous data streams with bounded computational cost and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery in autonomous underwater vehicles to enable adaptive missions and optimize communication, overcoming limitations of offline methods that require complete datasets and human labeling.

Method: Online clustering framework (OCF) that operates unsupervised on continuous data streams, using representative sampling to capture evolving feature distributions, supporting dynamic cluster merging/splitting without reprocessing full history.

Result: Achieves highest average F1 score of 0.68 across three datasets among online clustering approaches, with 3% standard deviation across trajectories, and maintains bounded computational time as data volume increases.

Conclusion: OCF provides scalable, adaptive real-time seafloor image interpretation beneficial for survey summaries and path planning in persistent autonomous marine exploration.

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting framework that uses monocular images for novel-view synthesis in large scenes by combining sparse SfM depth with coarse foundation model depth through object-segmented propagation and dynamic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian Splatting requires accurate depth from RGB-D/stereo cameras with limited range, while monocular images lack depth guidance. Large foundation models for depth estimation suffer from inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and texture ambiguity.

Method: Leverages sparse but accurate depth from visual-inertial SfM to refine dense but coarse depth from large foundation models. Uses object-segmented depth propagation algorithm and dynamic depth refinement module for structured objects and dynamic scenes.

Result: Superior rendering quality demonstrated on public and customized datasets for large scene novel-view synthesis.

Conclusion: VIM-GS successfully generates dense, accurate depth from monocular RGB inputs, enabling high-quality Gaussian Splatting rendering in large scenes by bridging sparse SfM and dense foundation model depth.

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Motivation: Ensuring fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time bioprinting is challenging due to limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation enables in situ monitoring critical for maintaining print quality and biological viability.

Method: Proposed BioLite U-Net architecture using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational load. Created novel manually annotated dataset of 787 RGB images with three classes (nozzle, bioink, background). Benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 baselines using mIoU, Dice score, and pixel accuracy on Raspberry Pi 4B.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net offers superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE proposes a novel anomaly synthesis method using graded diffusion with explicit mask alignment to generate realistic industrial anomalies for improving downstream segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SIAS methods lack texture details, fail to align with background properly, and struggle with fine-grained pixel-level anomaly generation.

Method: Uses graded diffusion framework with anomaly-only branch, incorporates clean background as prior, and employs explicit mask alignment strategy for progressive background alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec and BTAD datasets, enhancing downstream anomaly segmentation.

Conclusion: STAGE effectively addresses limitations of existing SIAS methods by generating context-consistent and structurally coherent anomalies through its novel diffusion-based approach.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

*Mustafa Yurdakul,Şakir Taşdemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an explainable deep learning model combining EfficientNetV2 with attention-based MLP-Mixer for brain tumor classification from MRI images, achieving 99.50% accuracy with superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumors require early diagnosis but manual MRI examination is error-prone and requires expertise, creating a need for automated, reliable diagnostic systems.

Method: Used Figshare dataset with 3,064 T1-weighted MRI images; evaluated 9 CNN architectures, selected EfficientNetV2 as backbone, integrated attention-based MLP-Mixer, and used Grad-CAM for visualization with five-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1 score, outperforming literature studies. Grad-CAM showed effective focus on relevant MRI regions.

Conclusion: The combined EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer model provides a robust, high-accuracy, and interpretable solution for clinical decision support in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

### [139] [Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723)
*Ruicheng Zhang,Jun Zhou,Zunnan Xu,Zihao Liu,Jiehui Huang,Mingyang Zhang,Yu Sun,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zo3T is a zero-shot test-time training framework for trajectory-guided image-to-video generation that uses 3D-aware kinematic projection, dynamic LoRA adapters, and guidance field rectification to achieve realistic motion without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory-guided I2V generation either require expensive fine-tuning on scarce datasets or produce unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating misalignment between manipulated latents and noise predictions.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection using scene depth for perspective-correct transformations, 2) Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA with dynamic adapters and regional feature consistency loss, 3) Guidance Field Rectification with one-step lookahead strategy.

Result: Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in zero-shot trajectory-guided video generation by ensuring 3D perspective correctness, maintaining generative fidelity, and enabling efficient progression towards target trajectories without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

*Qing Xu,Wenting Duan,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using mutual enhancement between tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies treat tissue semantic segmentation and nuclei instance segmentation separately, ignoring their inherent relationship, leading to insufficient histopathology understanding

Method: Proposes a co-segmentation paradigm with region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) for semantic/instance region prompts and mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) for cross-guidance and contextual consistency

Result: Extensive experiments on PUMA dataset show Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances

Conclusion: The collaborative approach effectively leverages the relationship between tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks, achieving superior performance in comprehensive histopathology image analysis

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV sensing approaches in forest environments suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light, especially under forest canopies where reliable navigation and data collection are challenging.

Method: Uses structured light projection with modulated wavelength to simultaneously capture depth and spectral information (650-850 nm bands). Depth is reconstructed via structured light while spectral data is captured through wavelength modulation of the projected light.

Result: Achieved 60% RMSE improvement over commercial depth sensors, validated spectral accuracy against reference spectrometer, and demonstrated 30% accuracy improvement in material differentiation when adding depth to color-only methods. Successfully tested in both lab and real-world rainforest environments.

Conclusion: The system enables lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception for complex natural environments, paving the way for improved navigation and data collection in dense foliage through simultaneous depth and spectral imaging capabilities.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network

exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for event-based vision research and early-stage development by converting affordable frame cameras into event camera alternatives with superior features.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low

delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, which relies on implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues.

Method: Propose a reasoning-augmented framework: 1) Generate structured explanations using Large Vision-Language Model with Role-Reversal Self-Loop, 2) Extract textual features from OCR and refined reasoning, 3) Obtain visual features via vision transformer, 4) Fuse streams using Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network with pairwise attention.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses multimodal dark humor understanding, with released dataset, annotations, and code to facilitate further research in content moderation and humor analysis.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic synthetic datasets that can enhance or replace real-world lidar datasets for training deep learning models in 3D perception tasks, addressing data scarcity and diversity issues.

Method: Synthesized datasets using emulated lidar sensors within digital twins modeled after real locations, including surrounding geometry, road alignment, lane topology, and vehicle movement patterns at intersections.

Result: The synthetic datasets show high statistical and structural similarity to real data, and models trained solely on synthetic data achieve improved detection performance on real, unseen data compared to models trained on real data.

Conclusion: UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmarks by increasing sample size and scene diversity, and represent the first digitally synthesized datasets capable of replacing in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks.

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in

Motivation: Humans are highly sensitive to faces, making identity preservation challenging in image customization. Current methods struggle with maintaining consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion when using multiple reference images, limiting identity scalability.

Method: UMO uses a "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm to reformulate multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem. It employs reinforcement learning on diffusion models and includes a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images (both synthesized and real).

Result: Extensive experiments show UMO significantly improves identity consistency and reduces identity confusion across several image customization methods, setting new state-of-the-art performance for identity preservation among open-source methods.

Conclusion: UMO successfully addresses the challenge of identity confusion in multi-reference image customization, providing a scalable solution that maintains high-fidelity identity preservation while being generally applicable to existing customization methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid LRCN (CNN+LSTM) with Bahdanau attention and contrastive learning achieves 88% accuracy for automated MPAA video rating classification, deployed as a web application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated video classification for age-suitability standards like MPAA ratings is needed due to rapid visual content growth, but traditional methods struggle with large data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature learning.

Method: Uses contrastive learning (Instance Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, Multi-View Contrastive Learning) with hybrid LRCN architecture combining CNN for spatial features, LSTM for temporal modeling, and Bahdanau attention for dynamic frame prioritization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 88% accuracy and F1 score of 0.8815 in Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, excelling at fine-grained distinctions like PG-13 vs R-rated content.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates robustness across various contrastive loss functions and has been deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating classification, providing efficient automated content compliance solution.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Curia is a radiology foundation model trained on 150,000 exams (130TB) that outperforms radiologists and other models across 19 tasks including organ identification, disease detection, and outcome prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI radiology models are narrow and single-task, which is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities and diseases. Foundation models promise broad generalization but this potential hasn't been realized in radiology.

Method: Trained Curia on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years - the largest corpus of real-world radiology data (150,000 exams, 130TB). Validated on a newly curated 19-task external benchmark.

Result: Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts tumor staging outcomes. Meets or surpasses radiologists and recent foundation models, showing emergent properties in cross-modality and low-data settings.

Conclusion: Curia demonstrates that foundation models can achieve broad generalization in radiology, outperforming human experts and existing models. The model weights are released to accelerate progress in medical AI.

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

### [153] [Leveraging Generic Foundation Models for Multimodal Surgical Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06831)
*Simon Pezold,Jérôme A. Kurylec,Jan S. Liechti,Beat P. Müller,Joël L. Lavanchy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows how adapting generic foundation models (V-JEPA) through transfer learning and integrating multimodal OR data improves surgical data science tasks like length of stay prediction, complication prediction, and phase recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how domain adaptation of foundation models and integration of complementary OR modalities can enhance surgical data science applications in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Used V-JEPA as foundation model, finetuned on unlabeled surgical videos, integrated additional time-resolved OR data streams via separate encoder to form shared representation space, tested on in-house liver surgery dataset and public HeiCo dataset.

Result: Finetuning on domain-specific data increased model performance. Multimodal integration improved results on in-house data. Video-only baseline matched top EndoVis2017 submissions, with further improvement after finetuning.

Conclusion: Surgical data science can effectively leverage public foundation models through domain adaptation and multimodal integration of complementary OR data streams, demonstrating significant potential for clinical decision support.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose serious threats to ML models, but most prior work focused on simple datasets like MNIST rather than real-world applications like traffic sign recognition.

Method: Trained a CNN to classify 47 traffic signs from LISA dataset, then evaluated robustness against FGSM and PGD adversarial attacks with varying perturbation magnitudes.

Result: Results showed a sharp decline in classification accuracy as perturbation magnitude increased, demonstrating high vulnerability to adversarial examples.

Conclusion: The study establishes baseline vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers to adversarial attacks, providing groundwork for developing specialized defense mechanisms for real-world traffic recognition systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While
prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper
investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA
Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47
different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a
sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude
increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This
study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

*Hajar Moradmand,Lei Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework (ARTSS) automates rheumatoid arthritis severity scoring from hand X-rays, achieving 99% joint identification accuracy and low prediction error with Vision Transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scoring of rheumatoid arthritis severity using Total Sharp Score is time-consuming and subjective, with significant inter- and intra-observer variability that needs to be addressed.

Method: Four-stage framework: 1) Image pre-processing with ResNet50, 2) Hand segmentation with UNet.3, 3) Joint identification with YOLOv7, 4) TSS prediction using multiple deep learning models (VGG16/19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, ViT) evaluated on 970 patients with 3-fold cross-validation.

Result: Joint identification achieved 99% accuracy. Vision Transformer (ViT) performed best with Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Framework handles joint disappearance and variable-length image sequences effectively.

Conclusion: ARTSS demonstrates deep learning's potential to automate RA scoring, offering time savings, reduced variability, improved accuracy, and better clinical decision support for rheumatologists.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

*Aymen Merrouche,Stefanie Wuhrer,Edmond Boyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A topology-adaptive deformation model for non-rigid 3D mesh matching that handles topological artifacts and works without data-driven priors, outperforming learning-based methods on challenging shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios like per-frame multi-view reconstructions often suffer from topological artifacts that break the assumptions of current approaches (Functional Maps assume near-isometric deformations, ARAP-like approaches assume ARAP deformations).

Method: Propose a topology-adaptive deformation model allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and bijective association constraints. Jointly optimize for a template mesh with adequate topology and its alignment with target shapes.

Result: The approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artifacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions. It outperforms methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality without relying on data-driven priors.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-adaptive deformation model effectively handles topological artifacts in 3D mesh matching, demonstrating superior performance on challenging real-world scenarios compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

*Behnoud Shafiezadeh,Amir Mashmool,Farshad Eshghi,Manoochehr Kelarestaghi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a selective GAN-based deblurring preprocessing step combined with YOLOv5 for license plate detection and character recognition, achieving high accuracy (95-97%) and fast detection times (0.026s) suitable for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems but faces challenges due to high variability and blurred license plates that require efficient deep learning solutions for real-time applications.

Method: Uses selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for deblurring preprocessing, coupled with YOLOv5 object detection for license plate detection, character segmentation, and character recognition.

Result: Achieves 95% accuracy in license plate detection and 97% in character recognition with detection time of 0.026 seconds. Deblur-GAN improves detection accuracy by nearly 40% for blurred license plates.

Conclusion: YOLOv5 with selective GAN preprocessing provides excellent precision and fast detection suitable for portable real-time applications, significantly enhancing performance especially for blurred input scenes.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

*Morteza Kiani Haftlang,Mohammadhossein Malmir,Foroutan Parand,Umberto Michelucci,Safouane El Ghazouali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight real-time medical image segmentation model combining Swin Transformer encoder with U-Net decoder, using self-supervised pretraining for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models are either limited in global context (U-Net) or too computationally expensive (transformers) for real-time clinical use.

Method: Shallow architecture with Swin Transformer-like encoder and U-Net-like decoder connected via skip pathways. Uses Barlow Twins self-supervised pretraining followed by task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameters and faster inference compared to existing models.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient alternative for real-time medical image segmentation in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 2D/3D registration method using spherical feature spaces and Riemannian distances in SO(4) space to improve accuracy and convergence speed for intraoperative surgical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean approximations for similarity learning distort manifold structure and slow convergence in 2D/3D registration, limiting the ability to handle substantial disturbances and accurately localize surgical instruments.

Method: Extract feature embeddings using CNN-Transformer encoder, project into spherical space, approximate geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in bi-invariant SO(4) space, and use differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization during inference.

Result: Superior accuracy demonstrated on both real and synthetic datasets in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Conclusion: Spherical feature spaces with Riemannian geometry provide more expressive and geometrically consistent similarity metrics, enhancing pose distinction and registration performance for intraoperative surgical applications.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained diffusion models for blind image restoration without the need for additional feature extractors, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Extracts features from degraded images using the model itself, extends self-attention with degraded features, and introduces sampling guidance to reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter's adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, expanding applications in image restoration tasks, including extending super-resolution models to handle unknown degradations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat is a crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained on the largest wheat image dataset (ImAg4Wheat) that outperforms general-domain models across 10 in-field vision tasks, demonstrating the value of crop-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain pretrained vision models fail to generalize well for agricultural tasks due to the complex interaction of fine canopy structures with varying field conditions, necessitating crop-specific foundation models.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining on ImAg4Wheat dataset containing 2.5 million high-resolution wheat images collected over 10 years across 30 global sites, spanning 2,000+ genotypes and 500+ environmental conditions.

Result: FoMo4Wheat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general-domain pretrained models across ten in-field vision tasks at both canopy and organ levels, showing robustness for wheat and transferability to other crops and weeds.

Conclusion: Crop-specific foundation models provide reliable in-field perception and pave the way toward universal crop foundation models with cross-species and cross-task capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat

TL;DR: H₂OT is a hierarchical plug-and-play framework that prunes redundant pose tokens in video transformers and recovers full sequences, improving efficiency for 3D human pose estimation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video pose transformers (VPTs) have high computational costs that make them impractical for resource-constrained devices, despite their success in 3D human pose estimation.

Method: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H₂OT) with Token Pruning Module (TPM) to dynamically select representative tokens and Token Recovering Module (TRM) to restore full-length sequences, working with both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency, showing that maintaining full pose sequences is unnecessary and a few representative tokens achieve high accuracy.

Conclusion: H₂OT provides a general-purpose framework that can be easily incorporated into common VPT models, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining estimation accuracy for 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

*Bo Yuan,Jiazi Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirical comparison of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and GLM-4.5 in tutoring tasks shows GPT-4o produces superior feedback for personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluations of LLMs as intelligent assistants in authentic learning scenarios are limited, despite their growing use in personalized education.

Method: Used a dataset of student answers with correctness labels, required LLMs to analyze quizzes, infer mastery profiles, and generate guidance. Employed Gemini as virtual judge for pairwise comparisons across accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness dimensions.

Result: GPT-4o was generally preferred with more informative and better structured feedback. DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 showed intermittent strengths but lower consistency.

Conclusion: LLMs are feasible as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support, and the study provides methodological guidance for future LLM-driven personalized learning research.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of prompt engineering optimization landscapes reveals different topological structures - systematic generation creates smooth landscapes while diversified generation produces rugged, hierarchical landscapes with varying complexity across different error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying optimization landscape of prompt engineering, which is currently treated as a black-box problem without characterization of the landscape topology that search algorithms navigate.

Method: Systematic analysis using autocorrelation analysis across semantic embedding spaces, with experiments on error detection tasks using two prompt generation strategies: systematic enumeration (1,024 prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts).

Result: Fundamentally different landscape topologies emerged - systematic generation yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes. Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories shows varying degrees of ruggedness.

Conclusion: The findings provide an empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt engineering landscapes, revealing that different generation strategies create distinct topological structures with implications for optimization algorithm design.

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Motivation: Medical coding requires experts to map unstructured clinical notes to standardized codes, but existing automated solutions are limited in scope and performance, particularly for rare codes.

Method: An agentic framework with large language models that implements official coding guidelines used by human experts, supporting the complete ICD-10 coding system.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on rare diagnosis codes, though fine-tuned discriminative classifiers still outperform for high-frequency codes (which they are limited to).

Conclusion: The framework represents significant progress in automated medical coding, with identified blind spots (systematically undercoded codes) providing direction for future improvements.

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric

*Madhava Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Alignment Gap to explain recurring failures in AI alignment methods like RLHF and DPO, showing how optimization pressure amplifies divergence from true human intent through a KL-tilting formalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address recurring failure patterns in feedback-based AI alignment methods (reward hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, misgeneralization) that persist despite methods like RLHF, DPO, Constitutional AI, and RLAIF.

Method: Uses KL-tilting formalism to illustrate optimization pressure effects, organizes failures into a catalogue of "Murphy's Laws of AI Alignment", proposes Alignment Trilemma framework, and conducts small-scale empirical studies for support.

Result: Identifies structural patterns in alignment failures and demonstrates how optimization tends to amplify divergence between proxy rewards and true human intent, leading to systematic failure modes.

Conclusion: Proposes the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure, Shift) as practical design levers and reframes alignment debates around structural limits and trade-offs rather than seeking definitive impossibility theorems.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

Motivation: Traditional street-design visualization is labor-intensive, hindering public engagement and collaborative decision-making in active transportation planning. Existing AI approaches require extensive training data and struggle with precise spatial variations in complex street scenes.

Method: A multi-agent system that edits bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery, integrating lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to create contextually appropriate designs.

Result: Experiments across diverse urban scenarios show the system adapts to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, producing visually coherent and instruction-compliant results consistently.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design, enabling rapid creation of realistic design scenarios for public engagement.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation

### [174] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT is a novel neural architecture combining transformer attention with global parent-child aggregation for processing ASTs in program synthesis, achieving 96% accuracy on ARC Prize 2025 with only 1.5M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for processing Abstract Syntax Trees rely on sequential processing or graph neural networks, which may not effectively capture both local dependencies and hierarchical tree structures needed for neural program synthesis tasks.

Method: Hybrid architecture using self-attention for local dependencies and Tree Feed-Forward Network with Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism for hierarchical structures. Includes gated aggregation, residual connections, and bidirectional propagation.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy on ARC Prize 2025 dataset, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3%), Grok-4 (15.9%), and SOAR (52%) with only 1.5M parameters. Edge projection identified as most critical component.

Conclusion: TreeGPT successfully combines transformer attention with tree-specific aggregation, demonstrating superior performance in program synthesis tasks while maintaining parameter efficiency, with edge projection being the key innovation.

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA integrates 3D occupancy representations into multimodal reasoning for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extra computational overhead during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack robust 3D spatial understanding critical for autonomous driving due to challenges in constructing accessible 3D representations and loss of fine-grained spatial details without large-scale 3D pretraining.

Method: Proposes OccVLA framework that treats dense 3D occupancy as both predictive output and supervisory signal, learning fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. Occupancy predictions serve as implicit reasoning processes that can be skipped during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving that addresses 3D spatial understanding limitations in current MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

*Jian Yang,Jiahui Wu,Li Fang,Hongchao Fan,Bianying Zhang,Huijie Zhao,Guangyi Yang,Rui Xin,Xiong You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRFormer is a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions to address flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies in urban road networks, outperforming baseline methods by up to 16%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban road networks have heterogeneous and hierarchical nature that challenges accurate representation learning. Traditional graph neural networks struggle due to homogeneity assumptions and single-scale focus.

Method: Uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from trajectory data, identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions, employs graph transformer for multi-scale dependencies, and fuses features with residual connections for contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks with up to 16% improvement, showing traffic-related tasks benefit more from trajectory data incorporation.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for task-agnostic road network representation models and reveals distinct association patterns between scale effects and flow heterogeneity in spatial interactions.

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

TL;DR: CogEdit benchmark evaluates MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge editing across three levels, and MIND framework outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on cognitive-level modifications but lack deeper meta-cognitive processes for knowledge editing in multimodal large language models.

Method: Proposed MIND framework with meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, game-theoretic interactions for knowledge activation monitoring, and label refinement for noise-robust updates.

Result: MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CogEdit benchmark and MIND framework successfully address meta-cognitive knowledge editing needs, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

*Sarang Patil,Zeyong Zhang,Yiran Huang,Tengfei Ma,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey paper on hyperbolic geometry applications in LLMs for hierarchical data representation, categorizing methods into four types and discussing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has hierarchical structures that Euclidean spaces struggle to represent effectively, while hyperbolic geometry excels at modeling tree-like hierarchies.

Method: Taxonomy-based survey categorizing Hyperbolic LLMs into four main approaches: exp/log map methods, fine-tuned models, fully hyperbolic architectures, and hyperbolic state-space models.

Result: Comprehensive framework for understanding how hyperbolic geometry enhances LLMs' semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning capabilities for hierarchical data.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry offers promising representation space for LLMs to better capture hierarchical relationships, with multiple implementation approaches showing potential across various domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems using LLMs lack mechanisms to quantify agent performance and assess credibility, creating challenges in evaluating and selecting reliable agents for complex tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFE-DFL framework combines automated feature engineering with decision-focused learning for BESS optimization, achieving 22.9-56.5% performance improvement over traditional methods on real-world UK energy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Predict-Then-Optimise approaches suffer from error cascading in energy management, while Decision-Focused Learning methods lack real-world validation and struggle with data scarcity and variability in BESS operations.

Method: Proposed AFE-DFL framework that integrates Automated Feature Engineering to extract richer representations from small datasets, combining electricity price/demand forecasting with BESS optimization to minimize operational costs.

Result: DFL yields lower operating costs than PTO, and adding AFE improves DFL performance by 22.9-56.5% compared to models without AFE, validated on real-world UK property dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability, showing domain-specific AFE enhances DFL, reduces reliance on domain expertise, and offers economic benefits for energy management systems.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoteAid-Chatbot is a conversational AI system that helps patients understand medical information using a multi-agent LLM with reinforcement learning, achieving human-level performance in patient education without explicit supervision for key communication attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients need knowledge to actively participate in their care, but often struggle to understand complex medical information. There's a need for AI systems that can effectively educate patients through natural conversations.

Method: Built on LLaMA 3.2 3B model with two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthetically generated medical conversations, followed by reinforcement learning using PPO with rewards based on patient understanding assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios.

Result: The chatbot exhibits emergent behaviors critical for patient education (clarity, relevance, structured dialogue) and surpasses non-expert humans in Turing tests, demonstrating successful handling of multi-turn interactions and diverse educational strategies.

Conclusion: The framework shows feasibility of applying low-cost PPO-based RL to realistic conversational domains, broadening RL-based alignment methods beyond healthcare applications.

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

### [182] [MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933)
*Md Hasebul Hasan,Mahir Labib Dihan,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MapAgent is a hierarchical multi-agent framework for geospatial reasoning that outperforms existing approaches by decoupling planning from execution and using specialized modules for map-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent frameworks are inadequate for geospatial tasks requiring spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction, as they treat tools uniformly and overwhelm LLMs with similar geospatial APIs.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent framework with high-level planner that decomposes queries into subgoals, specialized modules including dedicated map-tool agent for orchestrating geospatial APIs in parallel, and simpler modules for solution generation without agent overhead.

Result: Substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines on four diverse geospatial benchmarks (MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA).

Conclusion: MapAgent's hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs, making it an effective solution for map-integrated geospatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

*Haoyang He,Zihua Rong,Kun Ji,Chenyang Li,Qing Huang,Chong Xia,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRER is a reinforcement learning framework that improves reasoning in LLMs by rewarding beneficial reasoning steps and stabilizing training with dynamic length control, achieving GPT-o3-mini level performance with a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs use rule-based rewards that only assess answer correctness, ignoring whether the reasoning process actually improves the answer and offering limited control over logical depth.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) with two components: Reasoning Quality Reward for fine-grained credit to beneficial reasoning steps, and Dynamic Length Advantage to stabilize training by decaying advantage for responses with length deviations.

Result: 7B model achieves GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree benchmark with 400 training steps, 30% increase in CoT answer confidence, and shows generalization across logical reasoning datasets and AIME24 mathematical benchmark.

Conclusion: DRER effectively shapes Chain-of-Thought behavior through RL, providing a practical approach to enhance formal reasoning skills in large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REER introduces a reverse-engineering approach to discover latent reasoning processes from known-good solutions, creating DeepWriting-20K dataset and achieving competitive performance with proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods (RL and instruction distillation) struggle with open-ended creative generation due to unclear reward signals, expensive distillation, and teacher model limitations.

Method: REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER) works backwards from known-good solutions to computationally discover step-by-step deep reasoning processes using a scalable, gradient-free approach.

Result: Created DeepWriting-20K dataset with 20,000 reasoning trajectories. DeepWriter-8B model trained on this data outperforms open-source baselines and achieves competitive/superior performance to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: REER provides a novel paradigm for instilling deep reasoning in open-ended tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional forward-building approaches through reverse engineering from solutions.

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDIT is a test-time scaling method that helps large reasoning models find the shortest correct reasoning paths by balancing conciseness and correctness through constraint-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking - they overcomplicate simple problems with excessive strategy switching and convoluted reasoning traces, hindering interpretability.

Method: EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming) employs constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints to identify optimal reasoning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments show EDIT substantially enhances reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience.

Conclusion: EDIT effectively mitigates overthinking in large reasoning models by balancing multiple generation objectives (correctness and brevity) through efficient dynamic inference trimming.

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proof2Silicon is an end-to-end framework that uses RL-based prompt optimization (PREFACE) to generate formally verifiable Dafny code from natural language, then automatically translates it to C and synthesizes RTL hardware with up to 72% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate code that fails formal verification, which is critical for hardware and safety-critical systems. Existing approaches lack end-to-end automation from natural language to silicon.

Method: Combines PREFACE's RL-based prompt optimization for verifiable Dafny code generation, automatic translation to C via Dafny's backend and PyLog, and RTL synthesis using Vivado HLS.

Result: PREFACE improved Dafny verification success rates by up to 21% across LLMs. Proof2Silicon achieved 72% end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate on 100-task benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, scalable automated pipeline for formally verified hardware synthesis from natural language specifications to silicon implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

Motivation: Personalized AI assistants struggle with complex personal data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice lacking explanatory power.

Method: Uses personal causal graph of user's life events/habits, performs goal-directed causal traversals with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, retrieves adaptable plan schemas, and orchestrates with LLM for transparent explanations.

Result: CSM-based agents provide more context-aware, user-aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents, as measured by new metrics like Personalization Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a novel approach to memory-augmented causal reasoning in personalized agents, advancing transparent and trustworthy AI lifestyle assistants.

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMind is an LLM-driven table reasoning agent that autonomously performs multi-turn tool invocation, executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox, and uses planning/self-reflection for adaptive strategies, achieving superior performance on table reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based LLMs struggle with complex numerical computations in table reasoning, while tool-integrated methods lack true autonomous adaptability and rely on rigid patterns.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning: supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO) to optimize multi-objective strategies and prioritize high-quality trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments show TableMind achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines with substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy and computational precision.

Conclusion: TableMind demonstrates that autonomous tool-integrated reasoning with planning and self-reflection capabilities can significantly improve table reasoning performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Motivation: To enable large language models with complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities for deep research applications, moving beyond static multi-agent systems to dynamic autonomous single-agents.

Method: Continual reinforcement learning with entirely synthetic data applied to reasoning-optimized LLMs, featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration for autonomous action determination.

Result: Best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark, demonstrating enhanced agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The proposed RL recipe successfully enhances autonomous deep research capabilities in single-agent models, providing a promising approach for developing advanced AI research agents.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

TL;DR: A framework that shifts LLM reasoning from implicit exploration to structured reasoning using guidelines and stepwise refinement, improving stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning methods rely on implicit exploration, leading to unstable paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from experience.

Method: Extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and reflective signals from failures, then use guidelines with step-by-step execution and refinement during inference.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines across BBH, GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval benchmarks, improving stability and generalization.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning with guidelines and refinement enhances reasoning quality, transfers well across domains, supports cross-model collaboration, and matches/surpasses supervised fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for energy retrofit decision making with up to 54.5% top-1 accuracy, performing better on technical CO2 reduction goals than sociotechnical payback period objectives, but need improvements in consistency and contextual awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional energy retrofit approaches have limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in diverse residential contexts. Generative AI and LLMs can process contextual information to produce readable recommendations for practitioners.

Method: Evaluated 7 LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Claude) on residential retrofit decisions with two objectives: maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period (sociotechnical). Assessed performance on accuracy, consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning using 400 homes across 49 US states.

Result: LLMs generated effective recommendations reaching 54.5% top-1 match and 92.8% within top-5 without fine-tuning. Performance stronger for technical objectives. Models sensitive to location and building geometry but less to technology and occupant behavior. Low agreement across models, with higher performers diverging from others.

Conclusion: LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision making but require improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling for reliable practice. Most models show simplified engineering-style reasoning lacking deeper contextual awareness.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate virtual survey respondents through Partial Attribute Simulation (PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS) methods, showing promising results for scalable sociological research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survey methods are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scale, creating a need for more efficient alternatives using AI.

Method: Two simulation settings: PAS (predicting missing attributes from partial profiles) and FAS (generating complete synthetic datasets). Evaluated on LLM-S^3 benchmark with 11 real-world datasets across GPT-3.5/4 Turbo and LLaMA models.

Result: LLMs show consistent prediction performance trends, with context and prompt design significantly impacting simulation fidelity. Identified failure modes in demographic coherence.

Conclusion: Establishes rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological research and policy evaluation.

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

TL;DR: A multi-turn evaluation framework for measuring LLM seller agents' bargaining ability in e-commerce, featuring a large-scale benchmark and automated intent extraction pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective seller agents in online marketplaces that can track and interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which is crucial for bargaining effectiveness.

Method: Developed a multi-turn evaluation framework with: (1) large-scale e-commerce bargaining benchmark (622 categories, 9,892 products, 3,014 tasks), (2) turn-level evaluation grounded in Theory of Mind with annotated buyer intents, and (3) automated pipeline for extracting reliable intent from dialogue data.

Result: Created a comprehensive framework that moves beyond outcome-only metrics to assess agents' ability to extract and track buyer intents throughout negotiations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust method for evaluating seller agents' bargaining capabilities by focusing on intent tracking and interpretation across multi-turn e-commerce dialogues.

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Motivation: To balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency in complex multi-agent simulations, particularly for strategic planning research in 3D environments.

Method: Uses a waypoint system to discretize continuous states/actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes from movement decisions alone.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original CS:GO game.

Conclusion: DECOY provides an effective simulation environment for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree of Agents (TOA) is a multi-agent framework that segments long inputs into chunks processed by independent agents, enabling collaborative reasoning through tree-structured information exchange to address lost-in-the-middle issues in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in LLMs handling long-context tasks, particularly the lost-in-the-middle problem where middle information is underutilized, and avoid risks of discarding key information or attention dispersion from existing methods.

Method: Multi-agent reasoning framework that segments input into chunks processed by independent agents, with dynamic information exchange along tree-structured paths, prefix-hash caching, and adaptive pruning strategies.

Result: TOA significantly outperforms multiple baselines and achieves comparable performance to larger commercial models like Gemini1.5-pro on various long-context tasks using compact LLaMA3.1-8B.

Conclusion: The Tree of Agents framework effectively mitigates position bias and reduces hallucinations in long-context processing while maintaining efficiency with comparable API overhead, demonstrating strong performance with smaller models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyFedRAG is a federated RAG framework that enables privacy-preserving retrieval across hybrid healthcare data (SQL, knowledge graphs, clinical notes) using edge-cloud collaboration and anonymization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized RAG struggles with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive healthcare data across distributed settings, making it difficult for clinicians to retrieve rare disease cases while maintaining privacy constraints.

Method: Edge-cloud collaborative framework built on Flower with lightweight local retrievers, privacy-aware LLMs, three anonymization tools, and a three-tier caching strategy (local, intermediate representation, cloud inference caches).

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on PMC-Patients dataset in retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structurally heterogeneous data, unlocking LLM potential in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

*Chengwei Wu,Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Jiapu Wang,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel instruction data selection method that identifies instruction depth and semantic coverage as key factors for model alignment performance, achieving accelerated scaling compared to state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models are increasingly applied to downstream tasks, improving alignment performance and efficiency is crucial. Current methods fail to improve performance as instruction pools expand due to unclear key factors driving aligned model performance.

Method: The authors first investigate key factors influencing the relationship between instruction dataset distribution and aligned model performance. They then design an instruction selection algorithm to simultaneously maximize instruction depth and semantic coverage.

Result: The study identifies that instruction depth and semantic space coverage explain over 70% of model loss on development sets. Experimental results show the method sustainably improves model performance at a faster pace than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed instruction selection method based on maximizing depth and semantic coverage enables accelerated scaling and sustainable performance improvement for aligned language models.

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAS-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating GUI-shortcut hybrid agents in mobile environments, featuring 139 complex tasks, 88 predefined shortcuts, and 7 metrics to assess agents' ability to generate and use shortcuts for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic benchmarking frameworks for hybrid GUI agents that combine traditional GUI operations with efficient shortcuts (APIs, deep links, RPA scripts), despite their emerging importance for enhancing agent efficiency across platforms.

Method: Created MAS-Bench with 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world mobile applications, a knowledge base of 88 predefined shortcuts, and 7 evaluation metrics. Tasks are solvable via GUI-only operations but optimized for shortcut integration.

Result: Hybrid agents achieved significantly higher success rates and efficiency compared to GUI-only counterparts, demonstrating the benchmark's effectiveness in evaluating shortcut generation capabilities.

Conclusion: MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap and provides a foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and robust intelligent agents through GUI-shortcut hybrid approaches.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with real-time adaptation to dynamic supply chain environments with conflicting objectives like cost, service level, and sustainability.

Method: Uses Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms to search policy neural network parameter space, generating Pareto front of policies with Conditional Value-at-Risk for risk-sensitive decision-making.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inventory management case study, demonstrating effective response to supply chain dynamics and improved decision-making efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply chains through flexible, adaptable real-time decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BFS-Prover-V2 introduces dual innovations: multi-turn off-policy RL for training-time scaling and planner-enhanced multi-agent search for inference-time scaling, achieving state-of-the-art results on formal math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scaling challenges in LLM-based theorem proving - both training-time RL limitations and inference-time compute constraints that hinder performance in automated theorem proving systems.

Method: Two innovations: 1) Multi-turn off-policy RL framework with AlphaZero-inspired expert iteration, adaptive tactic filtering, and periodic retraining; 2) Planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture using general reasoning model as high-level planner to decompose theorems into subgoals with parallel prover agents and shared proof cache.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 95.08% on MiniF2F and 41.4% on ProofNet test sets, demonstrating significant performance improvements in formal mathematics theorem proving.

Conclusion: The dual scaling approach effectively addresses both training and inference challenges in LLM-based theorem proving, with techniques broadly applicable to domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search problems.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Targeting the problems of 'shortcuts' and insufficient contextual understanding in multimodal large models' complex cross-modal reasoning.

Method: Plug-and-play three-module pipeline (Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, Strategy Selector) that explicitly constructs 'understand-plan-select' cognitive process using 'intent sketch' strategies, requiring no parameter fine-tuning and achieving cross-model transfer through in-context engineering.

Result: Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to ~9.51 percentage points compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The 'intent sketch' reasoning component demonstrates practical value and portability in zero-shot scenarios, reducing conditional entropy and improving information utilization efficiency to suppress unintended shortcut reasoning.

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Result: The paper distills recurring patterns, identifies infrastructure bottlenecks, and provides practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents using reinforcement learning approaches.

Conclusion: RL provides a superior foundation for deep research systems compared to SFT and DPO methods, enabling better exploration, credit assignment, and reduced dependence on human priors and biases for complex multi-step agentic tasks.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VehicleWorld introduces a comprehensive automotive environment with 30 modules and 250 APIs, proposing State-based Function Call (SFC) which outperforms traditional function calling by maintaining explicit system state awareness for vehicle cockpit control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent vehicle cockpits require coordination across complex subsystems, but traditional Function Calling approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls that lead to inefficiency and limited error recovery.

Method: Developed VehicleWorld environment with 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties. Proposed State-based Function Call (SFC) that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions.

Result: Experimental results show SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. Direct state prediction was found to outperform function calling for environmental control.

Conclusion: SFC provides a more efficient approach for vehicle cockpit control by maintaining state awareness, enabling better performance than traditional stateless function calling methods. The implementation code is publicly available.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Bhavul Gauri,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation framework for measuring iterative refinement in LLMs across ideation, code, and math tasks, showing domain-dependent gains and optimal prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of clear measurement methods for when iteration helps vs. hurts in multi-turn LLM workflows, despite widespread use in iterative refinement applications.

Method: 12-turn controlled conversations per task with varied prompts (vague feedback to targeted steering), domain-appropriate scoring (unit tests for code, answer-equivalence for math, originality/feasibility for ideation), and turn-level metrics tracking semantic movement, change, and output size growth.

Result: Gains are domain-dependent: early turns matter for ideas and code, late turns matter for math with elaboration. Vague feedback plateaus/reverses correctness after few turns, while targeted prompts reliably improve quality. Consistent patterns: ideation shows semantic movement, code grows in size, math starts fixed but can improve with late elaboration.

Conclusion: Framework makes iteration measurable and comparable across models, providing signals for when to steer, stop, or switch strategies in multi-turn LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

### [208] [RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822)
*Chenyang Zhu,Spencer Hong,Jingyu Wu,Kushal Chawla,Charlotte Tang,Youbing Yin,Nathan Wolfe,Erin Babinsky,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAFFLES is an evaluation architecture that uses reasoning and iterative refinement to identify failures in long-horizon LLM agentic systems, significantly outperforming existing baselines in fault detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM agentic systems are limited to single metrics and end-to-end outcomes, making it difficult to identify where and why complex multi-component systems fail over long horizons.

Method: RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline with a central Judge that investigates faults and specialized Evaluators that assess both system components and the Judge's reasoning quality, building a history of hypotheses.

Result: RAFFLES achieved 43% agent-step fault pair accuracy on Algorithmically-Generated dataset (vs previous best 16.6%) and 20% on Hand-Crafted dataset (vs previous best 8.8%) on the Who&When benchmark.

Conclusion: RAFFLES represents a significant advancement in automated fault detection for autonomous systems, moving beyond labor-intensive manual human review and enabling better understanding of complex agentic system failures.

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (extended reasoning chains) doesn't consistently improve accuracy for knowledge-intensive tasks and often increases hallucinations, though it remains beneficial compared to no thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of test-time scaling (extended reasoning at inference time) for knowledge-intensive tasks where factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are critical.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks, analyzing how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior through case studies and behavioral analysis.

Result: Increasing test-time computation doesn't consistently improve accuracy and often leads to more hallucinations. Reduced hallucinations come from models choosing to abstain rather than improved factual recall, while longer reasoning can induce confirmation bias and overconfident hallucinations.

Conclusion: While test-time scaling has limitations for knowledge-intensive tasks (increased hallucinations, confirmation bias), enabling thinking remains beneficial compared to non-thinking approaches.

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper2Agent is an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents that can execute the paper's methods and answer scientific queries through natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research papers require substantial effort to understand and adapt code/data/methods, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. The goal is to transform passive research artifacts into active AI systems.

Method: Systematically analyzes papers and associated codebases using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine the MCP. These paper MCPs connect to chat agents to execute complex scientific queries.

Result: Successfully created agents that leverage AlphaGenome for genomic variant interpretation and agents based on ScanPy/TISSUE for single-cell/spatial transcriptomics analyses. Agents can reproduce original paper results and handle novel user queries.

Conclusion: Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination by turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, creating a foundation for collaborative AI co-scientists.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

*Xiangwei Shen,Zhimin Li,Zhantao Yang,Shiyi Zhang,Yingfang Zhang,Donghao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Direct-Align method with SRPO improves diffusion model alignment by avoiding expensive multistep denoising and enabling online reward adjustment, achieving 3x better realism and aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion model alignment methods suffer from computational expense of multistep denoising and require continuous offline reward model adaptation for desired aesthetic quality.

Method: Proposes Direct-Align method that predefines noise prior to recover images via interpolation, avoiding late timestep over-optimization. Introduces Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO) with text-conditioned rewards for online adjustment through prompt augmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned FLUX.1.dev model shows over 3x improvement in human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses computational limitations and offline adaptation requirements of previous methods, enabling more efficient and effective alignment of diffusion models with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show internal inconsistencies in behavior across different experimental settings, making them unreliable substitutes for human participants in research despite generating human-like survey responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-based synthetic agents can truly substitute for human participants in research by examining their internal consistency across different experimental settings.

Method: Developed a study to reveal agents' internal states and examine their behavior in basic dialogue settings, testing behavioral hypotheses to assess consistency between conversation behavior and revealed internal states.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and sizes. While agents can generate human-like survey responses, they fail to maintain internal consistency.

Conclusion: LLM agents have a critical gap in their ability to accurately substitute for real human participants in research due to their lack of internal consistency, despite surface-level similarity in survey responses.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize speech modeling during continual pre-training by adapting existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality, examining how different factors influence this process.

Method: Systematic examination of model architecture, data representation, and training robustness; experiments with speech encoders and clustering granularity across different model scales; analysis of cluster distribution and phonemic alignments.

Result: Optimal discretization strategies vary with model capacity; linguistic and paralinguistic patterns uncovered through discrete vocabulary analysis; domain matching between discretization training and target applications is crucial for model robustness.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into effective discrete unit representations for SLMs, showing that model capacity, clustering strategies, and domain alignment significantly impact speech modeling performance during continual pre-training.

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel N-Gram frequency tensor approach for detecting LLM hallucinations, outperforming traditional metrics and competing with LLM judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hallucination detection metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore lack semantic depth needed to effectively identify hallucinations in LLM-generated text.

Method: Construct N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM text to capture co-occurrence patterns, apply tensor decomposition to extract singular values, and train MLP binary classifier.

Result: Significant improvements over traditional baselines and competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges on HaluEval dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor-based approach provides richer semantic structure for effective hallucination detection, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models cannot continuously adapt and learn from new data during reasoning at inference time, limiting their ability to handle dynamic reasoning tasks.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) Trigger module detects reasoning failures through real-time evaluation metrics, (2) Trigger Buffer clusters anomaly samples using streaming HDBSCAN with stability checks, (3) Lora Store dynamically optimizes parameter updates with adapter pool for knowledge retention.

Result: SAGE demonstrates excellent accuracy, robustness, and stability on atomic reasoning subtasks through dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables adaptive updates during reasoning at inference time, addressing the limitation of static LLMs in continuous learning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate can harm reasoning accuracy even with stronger models outnumbering weaker ones, as agents prioritize agreement over challenging flawed reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how diversity in model capabilities affects multi-agent debate outcomes, challenging the assumption that debate always improves reasoning.

Method: Conducted experiments with heterogeneous groups of AI agents (varying capabilities) engaging in debate, analyzing how reasoning evolves over time.

Result: Debate decreased accuracy over time, with models frequently shifting from correct to incorrect answers to achieve agreement rather than challenging flawed reasoning.

Conclusion: Naive debate applications can degrade performance when agents aren't incentivized or equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning, revealing important failure modes in multi-agent reasoning exchanges.

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To forecast translation quality without executing the translation system itself, exploring how linguistic features and token characteristics can predict translation performance.

Method: Used gradient boosting models with features including token fertility ratios, token counts, and linguistic metadata (language family, script, region) on GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in FLORES-200 benchmark.

Result: Achieved R²=0.66 for translations into English and R²=0.72 for translations from English to other languages. Feature importance showed typological factors dominate predictions into English, while fertility plays larger role for diverse target languages.

Conclusion: Translation quality is shaped by both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation without running actual translations.

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

*Logan Lawrence,Ashton Williamson,Alexander Shelton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a direct-scoring method using synthetic summaries to enable absolute scoring for LLM-based evaluation while maintaining sample-level correlation performance comparable to pairwise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pairwise comparison methods for LLM evaluation lack the ability to assign absolute scores to individual summaries, which is crucial for thresholding applications.

Method: Uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time, enabling direct scoring of individual summaries rather than just relative comparisons.

Result: Performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise evaluators on SummEval (+0.03), TopicalChat (-0.03), and HANNA (+0.05) benchmarks in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations.

Conclusion: The proposed direct-scoring method provides absolute scoring capability while maintaining competitive correlation performance, with synthetic summaries released to facilitate future work.

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM framework for analyzing hospital call center staff messages to identify topics and classify reasons, achieving up to 79.2% accuracy with data security compliance and visualization tools for healthcare insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospital call centers generate large volumes of text data from patient requests and staff communications, but traditional supervised learning requires extensive annotated data and training. LLMs offer a more computationally efficient approach for healthcare analytics.

Method: Multi-stage LLM-based framework using reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models to identify staff message topics and classify messages by reasons in a multi-class fashion. Incorporates data security measures and HIPAA compliance.

Result: Best-performing model was o3 with 78.4% weighted F1-score and 79.2% accuracy, followed by gpt-5 with 75.3% weighted F1-score and 76.2% accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient utilization of staff messaging data, identifies training opportunities, supports improved patient experience and care quality through a visualization decision support tool that transforms messages into actionable insights.

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,Nihal Karim,Hamza Louzan,Victor Wei,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenization inefficiency in morphologically complex languages leads to higher computational costs and lower accuracy in LLMs. Higher token fertility (tokens per word) consistently predicts lower accuracy across models and subjects. Reasoning models outperform non-reasoning peers, and token inflation results in quadratic increases in training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural disadvantages that tokenization inefficiency imposes on morphologically complex, low-resource languages, which inflate compute resources and depress accuracy in large language models.

Method: Evaluated 10 large language models on AfriMMLU dataset (9,000 multiple-choice questions across 5 subjects and 16 African languages), analyzing the relationship between token fertility (tokens per word) and model accuracy.

Result: Higher fertility consistently predicts lower accuracy across all models and subjects. Reasoning models (DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across both high and low resource languages. A doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time.

Conclusion: The findings motivate the need for morphologically aware tokenization, fair pricing models, and multilingual benchmarks to achieve equitable natural language processing for all languages.

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings of conventional health search engines and bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge by providing evidence-based medical information.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search for retrieval, and fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 model with QLoRA optimization for answer generation. Integrates PubMed articles, Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias.

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced language models show strong potential for making biomedical literature more accessible, paving the way for multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional reasoning as a test for genuine AI understanding, showing that standard fine-tuning causes cognitive specialization (better forward performance but worse reverse reasoning). They develop Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT) to enable bidirectional capabilities without explicit reverse training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models truly understand concepts or merely recognize patterns, and to develop a method for achieving genuine comprehension through bidirectional reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed bidirectional reasoning as a test for understanding, then developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT) using three example types: positive (semantic preservation), negative (different semantics), and forward-direction obfuscation examples to train models for deeper understanding.

Result: CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities, overcoming the cognitive specialization problem observed in standard fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: Bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for assessing genuine understanding in AI systems and as a practical training approach for developing more capable models that comprehend concepts rather than just recognizing patterns.

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

*Anya Ji,Claire Augusta Bergey,Ron Eliav,Yoav Artzi,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: People generalize shared naming conventions to new objects through conceptual alignment, not arbitrary labeling, with generalization following visual similarity patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether shared naming systems are arbitrary labels or involve broader conceptual alignment that generalizes to new referents.

Method: Dyadic communication study with 302 participants using KiloGram dataset's abstract tangram images. Partners coordinated on referential conventions for one set, then alignment was measured for undiscussed images.

Result: Strong evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment for new images, with nonlinear decay based on visual similarity (Shepard's law) and robustness across nameability levels.

Conclusion: Ad hoc conventions reflect genuine conceptual coordination rather than arbitrary labels, with implications for reference theories and adaptive language agent design.

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoPeD improves small language model reasoning by filtering noisy rationales and using correctness-aware training to enhance faithfulness and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models fine-tuned on LLM-generated CoT data often learn from noisy rationales that don't properly support answers, leading to spurious correlations and poor reasoning quality.

Method: Introduces correctness-aware task setting that encourages predicting answers based on correct rationales and revising incorrect ones, plus Correctness-Aware Weighted loss that dynamically adjusts training instance contributions based on rationale-answer alignment.

Result: Effective on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmark reasoning datasets, demonstrating improved reasoning quality.

Conclusion: CoPeD successfully enhances small language model reasoning by addressing noisy rationales through correctness perception and weighted loss strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

TL;DR: Icon² is a novel method that leverages LLMs' representation space to efficiently construct high-quality preference datasets by extracting layer-wise direction vectors for preference encoding and applying bidirectional inherent control during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for constructing preference datasets face distribution mismatches with target models and high computational overhead from sampling multiple stochastic responses.

Method: Extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode human preferences, filters self-synthesized instructions based on inherent consistency, and applies bidirectional inherent control during decoding to generate response pairs with clear alignment distinctions.

Result: Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve average win rate improvements of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%.

Conclusion: Icon² demonstrates significant improvements in both alignment performance and efficiency for LLM preference dataset construction, offering a more effective and computationally efficient approach compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized

Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

*Xugang Lu,Peng Shen,Yu Tsao,Hisashi Kawai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model to handle acoustic-linguistic representation mismatches in ASR knowledge transfer, treating alignment as a detection problem with flexible probabilistic mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acoustic and linguistic representations have inherent structural asymmetries in ASR - many-to-one and one-to-many mappings, plus noisy frames without linguistic counterparts. Traditional alignment methods struggle with these distributional mismatches.

Method: Unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries with soft partial matching. Ensures every linguistic token is grounded while allowing flexible probabilistic mappings from acoustic to linguistic units.

Result: Experimental results on CTC-based ASR system with pre-trained language model demonstrate effectiveness in flexibly controlling matching degree and improving ASR performance.

Conclusion: Treating alignment as a detection problem with unbalanced optimal transport provides an effective solution for bridging acoustic-linguistic representation gaps in ASR knowledge transfer, handling structural asymmetries and noisy frames while ensuring full linguistic coverage.

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

TL;DR: This paper investigates multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics using LLMs and fine-tuned BERT models, creating a manually labeled dataset with MOS approach for reliable ground-truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional content in song lyrics shapes listener experiences and musical preferences, and to develop effective emotion recognition methods for music information retrieval.

Method: Constructed a manually labeled dataset using mean opinion score (MOS) approach with multiple human raters. Evaluated several LLMs in zero-shot scenarios and fine-tuned a BERT-based model for predicting six emotional intensity scores.

Result: Experimental results revealed relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot vs fine-tuned models in capturing nuanced emotional content. LLMs showed potential for emotion recognition in creative texts.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music information retrieval applications and makes the labeled dataset publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

TL;DR: SAID is a novel framework that integrates both textual and relational structure information for few-shot intent detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods through query-adaptive attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intent detection methods focus only on textual data and neglect crucial structural information like query-query and query-answer relations in conversational systems, limiting their effectiveness in few-shot scenarios.

Method: Proposes SAID framework that unifies textual and relational structure information in pretraining. Introduces QueryAdapt mechanism that generates intent-specific relation tokens from learned query-query and query-answer relations for fine-grained knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show SAID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot intent detection.

Conclusion: Integrating structural relational information with textual data through the proposed SAID framework and QueryAdapt mechanism effectively improves intent detection performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks.

Method: Proposes NCode (universal numerical string representation for architectures), reformulates NAS as ranking task, uses instruction-tuning with pruning-based subspace sampling, and creates a curated dataset of architecture-performance pairs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (LoRA configurations for segmentation/generation) tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search that works across domains without extensive adaptation.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extends method reuse beyond highly similar questions to handle low-similarity cases and hidden similarities by separating questions from solutions and guiding LLMs to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing method reuse approaches require questions to be highly similar, limiting their applicability. The paper aims to extend method reuse to questions with low similarity or hidden similarities that aren't explicitly observable.

Method: Separates questions and solutions rather than feeding them as pairs to LLMs. Guides LLMs to adapt solutions to new but related questions, focusing on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Extends to cases with partial feature sharing or hidden characteristics.

Result: Experimental verification shows the scope-extension approach increases probability of filtering out reusable solutions, improving effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully extends method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints, enabling more effective cross-question solution adaptation and transfer.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Motivation: Address English-centric bias in large language models and promote low-resource languages like Bavarian while serving the German NLP community.

Method: Continuous pretraining on Llama 3.1-8B scaled to 10B parameters with 164B tokens (balanced English/German/Bavarian), unified tokenizer creation, architecture optimization, and standardized trilingual evaluation suite development.

Result: Achieves strong cross-lingual performance, surpasses Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian, outperforms EuroLLM in English, matches EuroLLM in German, and demonstrates efficient multilingual pretraining on Cerebras CS-2.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for inclusive foundation models that successfully integrate low-resource languages while maintaining strong performance across multiple languages.

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive

*Ningyuan Deng,Hanyu Duan,Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text embedding models struggle to accurately capture numerical nuances in text, particularly in domains like finance where precise numerical understanding is critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding models are increasingly used in numerical-sensitive domains like finance and healthcare, but their capability to understand nuanced numerical information remains unclear and unbenchmarked.

Method: Evaluated 13 widely used text embedding models using synthetic financial data to test their ability to accurately encode numerical content and capture numerical details.

Result: Most embedding models generally struggle to capture numerical details accurately, showing limitations in handling precise numerical content despite their widespread use.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved embedding models with better numerical understanding capabilities, informing future research to strengthen NLP systems for handling numerical content.

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

### [235] [Exploring Subjective Tasks in Farsi: A Survey Analysis and Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05719)
*Donya Rooein,Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Debora Nozza,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Farsi, despite having over 127 million speakers and substantial digital text resources, faces significant challenges in subjective NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and toxicity detection due to poor data availability, quality issues, and lack of demographic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the classification of Farsi as a middle-resource language by examining its actual capabilities in subjective NLP tasks, given the growing digital text availability but persistent data quality and accessibility problems.

Method: Reviewed 110 publications on subjective tasks in Farsi, analyzed data availability and quality issues, and evaluated prediction models using the limited available datasets to assess performance stability.

Result: Found significant challenges in data availability and quality, with most datasets lacking essential demographic factors. Model evaluation showed highly unstable results across both datasets and models, indicating poor reliability.

Conclusion: The volume of data alone is insufficient to improve a language's NLP prospects; data quality, demographic factors, and dataset accessibility are crucial for effective subjective language modeling in Farsi.

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

*Charles M. Varmantchaonala,Niclas GÖtting,Nils-Erik SchÜtte,Jean Louis E. K. Fendji,Christopher Gies*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCSE is a pretrained quantum context-sensitive embedding model that uses quantum computation to capture contextual word relationships through five innovative context matrix computation methods, demonstrating effectiveness on both low-resource Fulani and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computation for natural language processing by capturing context-sensitive word embeddings and addressing the data scarcity problem in low-resource languages through quantum-native approaches.

Method: Developed QCSE model with five distinct context matrix computation methods (exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, hash-based transformations) to create unique quantum representations of words based on linguistic context.

Result: QCSE successfully captures context sensitivity and leverages quantum system expressibility for rich context-aware language information, demonstrating effectiveness on both Fulani (low-resource) and English datasets.

Conclusion: Quantum computation shows strong potential for NLP, particularly in addressing data scarcity for low-resource languages, opening new avenues for applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges.

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

*Luis Felipe Chary,Miguel Arjona Ramirez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatinX is a multilingual TTS model for speech-to-speech translation that preserves speaker identity across languages using a 3-stage training approach with DPO optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a text-to-speech model that can maintain the source speaker's identity when translating speech across different languages, particularly focusing on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese.

Method: 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: (1) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (2) supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (3) alignment with Direct Preference Optimization using WER and speaker-similarity metrics.

Result: LatinX with DPO consistently reduces Word Error Rate and improves objective speaker similarity over fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations show stronger perceived speaker similarity than XTTSv2 baseline, revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures.

Conclusion: The model successfully preserves speaker identity across languages, with DPO optimization proving effective. Future work includes cross-lingual analyses, balanced preference signals, and lower-latency architectures.

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

### [239] [ZhiFangDanTai: Fine-tuning Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05867)
*ZiXuan Zhang,Bowen Hao,Yingjie Li,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZhiFangDanTai framework combines GraphRAG with LLM fine-tuning to generate comprehensive TCM formulas with detailed explanations, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TCM models lack comprehensive formula details like sovereign/minister/assistant/courier roles, efficacy, contraindications, and diagnostic information. Current datasets are insufficient for deep model outputs.

Method: Proposes ZhiFangDanTai framework using Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) to retrieve structured TCM knowledge and synthesize concise summaries. Constructs enhanced instruction dataset for LLM fine-tuning to improve information integration.

Result: Experimental results on collected and clinical datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Theoretical proofs demonstrate reduced generalization error and hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations in TCM formula generation by combining structured knowledge retrieval with enhanced fine-tuning, providing more comprehensive and accurate TCM formula outputs.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

TL;DR: MedFactEval framework uses LLM juries for scalable clinical text fact evaluation, achieving 81% agreement with physician panels, while MedAgentBrief workflow generates high-quality discharge summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert review of LLM-generated clinical text is unscalable for continuous quality assurance needed in healthcare systems.

Method: Two-part approach: MedFactEval framework with clinician-defined key facts and multi-LLM majority vote evaluation; MedAgentBrief multi-step workflow for generating factual discharge summaries.

Result: MedFactEval LLM Jury achieved 81% Cohen's kappa agreement with 7-physician panel, statistically non-inferior to single human expert (67% kappa, P<0.001).

Conclusion: Provides robust evaluation framework and high-performing generation workflow for responsible deployment of generative AI in clinical settings.

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

*Abhijnan Nath,Carine Graff,Nikhil Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness in multiturn, multiparty collaborations, focusing on friction agents that intervene to encourage reflection and deliberative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become AI collaborators, their behavior in multiturn interactions must be predictable and reliable. Common alignment techniques are developed for single-user settings and don't account for long-horizon multiparty interaction dynamics.

Method: The study uses a roleplay methodology to evaluate interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. A novel counterfactual evaluation framework quantifies how friction interventions change group collaboration trajectories and belief alignment.

Result: Results show that a friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both convergence to common ground (agreed-upon task-relevant propositions) and correctness of task outcomes.

Conclusion: Friction-aware alignment methods are more effective for LLM agents in multiturn, multiparty collaborative settings compared to traditional single-user alignment approaches, enabling better group deliberation and decision-making outcomes.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

### [242] [Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05908)
*Yue Gu,Zhihao Du,Ying Shi,Shiliang Zhang,Qian Chen,Jiqing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PSC-Joint approach to improve contextual ASR by identifying and integrating only the most relevant biasing information rather than entire biasing lists, addressing performance degradation with longer lists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-attention-based contextual ASR models struggle with varying biasing information volume, especially when biasing lists become long, as only limited relevant information is needed for specific ASR intermediate representations.

Method: PSC-Joint defines three semantic correlations (list-level, phrase-level, token-level) between ASR representations and biasing information, jointly models them to highlight most relevant information, and uses purification mechanism with grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter irrelevant phrases.

Result: Achieves average relative F1 score improvements of 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech across biasing lists of varying lengths compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses biasing information volume variations by focusing on most relevant information, improving contextual ASR performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

*Sangmin Bae*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This dissertation resolves the conflict between adaptive computation efficiency and system-level bottlenecks in LLMs through co-designed algorithms and architectures that optimize both dynamism and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face high computational costs, and while adaptive computation methods like early-exiting aim to reduce costs, they create system-level bottlenecks that paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference.

Method: Proposes efficient parallel decoding to address overhead in conventional early-exiting, uses deep parameter sharing to mitigate synchronization issues, and develops a unified framework with lightweight pretrained routers to dynamically assign optimal recursion depth per token.

Result: The approach establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model.

Conclusion: Co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures strikes an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency, resolving the fundamental conflict in adaptive computation methods for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

Motivation: LLMs tend to produce hallucinations, but existing truthfulness benchmarks like TruthfulQA are primarily available only in English, creating a gap in evaluating LLMs in low-resource languages like Filipino.

Method: Created KatotohananQA (Filipino translation of TruthfulQA) and assessed seven free-tier proprietary models using a binary-choice framework to evaluate truthfulness in Filipino.

Result: Significant performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, newer OpenAI models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrated strong multilingual robustness, disparities found across question characteristics/types.

Conclusion: Need for broader multilingual evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage, as some question types are less robust to multilingual transfer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFCIG-CSS is a novel conversational speech synthesis system that uses multimodal fine-grained context interaction graphs to model word-level semantic and prosodic interactions from dialogue history, achieving superior prosodic expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSS methods only model utterance-level interactions and overlook fine-grained semantic and prosodic knowledge at the word level in multimodal dialogue history, limiting prosody naturalness.

Method: Proposes two multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs (semantic and prosody graphs) that encode word-level interactions between semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in the dialogue history.

Result: Experiments on DailyTalk dataset show MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in prosodic expressiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained interaction graph approach effectively captures word-level semantic and prosodic interactions, leading to more natural conversational prosody in synthesized speech.

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

TL;DR: OLieRA introduces Lie group theory and multiplicative updates to preserve LLM parameter geometry while enforcing orthogonality constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance in continual learning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter regularization methods like O-LoRA and N-LoRA overlook that conventional additive fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters, limiting their performance in preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA) that uses multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces, leveraging Lie group theory.

Result: OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of Tasks setting.

Conclusion: Preserving the geometric structure of LLM parameters through multiplicative updates in Lie groups, combined with orthogonality constraints, significantly improves continual learning performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of

TL;DR: EuroParlVote is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM bias in political contexts using European Parliament data, revealing gender misclassification and vote prediction biases favoring centrist groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for assessing large language model biases in politically sensitive scenarios, particularly using real-world European Parliament data with demographic metadata.

Method: Developed EuroParlVote dataset linking debate speeches to vote outcomes with MEP demographic data, then evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on gender classification and vote prediction tasks.

Result: LLMs consistently misclassify female MEPs as male, show reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female speakers, and favor centrist political groups while underperforming on far-left and far-right groups. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform open-weight alternatives.

Conclusion: The study reveals systematic biases in LLMs within political contexts and releases the EuroParlVote dataset to support future research on fairness and accountability in NLP for political applications.

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

*Jacob Mitchell Springer,Vaibhav Adlakha,Siva Reddy,Aditi Raghunathan,Marius Mosbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic data from LLMs improves embedding models but benefits are sparse and localized, with trade-offs between different tasks, challenging the notion that synthetic data leads to more robust general-purpose embedders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available synthetic datasets for studying their role in text embedding generalization, and to critically examine where synthetic data actually improves model performance.

Method: Reproduced and publicly released the synthetic data from Wang et al. (Mistral-E5), then analyzed where synthetic data improves model generalization and observed performance trade-offs across different task categories.

Result: Synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent improvements, but benefits are sparse and highly localized to individual datasets with trade-offs between different categories - data that helps one task may degrade performance on another.

Conclusion: Current synthetic data approaches have limitations for building general-purpose embedders, challenging the assumption that training on synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

### [253] [Mask-GCG: Are All Tokens in Adversarial Suffixes Necessary for Jailbreak Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06350)
*Junjie Mu,Zonghao Ying,Zhekui Fan,Zonglei Jing,Yaoyuan Zhang,Zhengmin Yu,Wenxin Zhang,Quanchen Zou,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mask-GCG improves jailbreak attacks on LLMs by using learnable token masking to identify and prune redundant tokens in fixed-length suffixes, reducing computational overhead while maintaining attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attack methods like GCG use fixed-length suffixes that may contain redundant tokens, leading to unnecessary computational overhead without improving attack effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Mask-GCG with learnable token masking to identify high-impact tokens in suffixes, increasing update probability for important tokens while pruning low-impact ones to reduce gradient space size.

Result: Experimental results show most suffix tokens contribute significantly to attack success, but pruning minority low-impact tokens doesn't affect loss values or attack success rate, revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.

Conclusion: Mask-GCG demonstrates efficient jailbreak attacks with reduced computational overhead while maintaining effectiveness, providing insights for developing more efficient and interpretable LLMs from a security perspective.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

### [254] [PL-CA: A Parametric Legal Case Augmentation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06356)
*Ao Chang,Yubo Chen,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PL-CA proposes a parametric RAG framework that encodes legal knowledge into parametric vectors and integrates them into LLMs via LoRA, reducing context window pressure while maintaining performance on multi-task legal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG methods have limitations including constrained context windows, computational overhead from long contexts, and inadequate benchmarks for real-world legal scenarios requiring multiple mixed tasks.

Method: Introduces parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework that performs data augmentation on corpus knowledge, encodes legal knowledge into parametric vectors, and integrates this knowledge into LLM's feed-forward networks via LoRA.

Result: Experimental results show the method reduces overhead from excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG.

Conclusion: PL-CA effectively addresses limitations of conventional RAG in legal domains by using parametric knowledge integration, and provides an expert-annotated multi-task legal dataset for better evaluation.

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

TL;DR: LLMs show strong English commonsense generation but perform poorly in less-resourced languages like Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian, with contextual support helping underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate multilingual commonsense generation capabilities of LLMs across different language resources and create a benchmark for evaluation.

Method: Created MULTICOM benchmark extending COCOTEROS to 4 languages, evaluated various open-source LLMs using automatic metrics, LLM-as-judge approaches (Prometheus, JudgeLM), and human annotations.

Result: Consistently superior performance in English, significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. Contextual support showed mixed results but tended to benefit underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in multilingual commonsense generation, particularly for less-resourced languages, highlighting the need for improved multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: WebExplorer is an 8B parameter web agent that achieves state-of-the-art performance on information-seeking benchmarks through a novel data generation approach and reinforcement learning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source web agents have limited information-seeking abilities on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations, with the key challenge being scarcity of challenging data for information seeking.

Method: Introduces WebExplorer: a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative, long-to-short query evolution. Develops advanced web agent through supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning, supporting 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse information-seeking benchmarks. As an 8B model, it effectively searches over average 16 turns after RL training, outperforming WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and achieving best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES. Also shows strong generalization on HLE benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward long-horizon web agents, demonstrating that high-quality data generation and training methodology can enable smaller models to outperform much larger counterparts in complex web navigation tasks.

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

*Andrei Baroian,Kasper Notebomer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Layer-Wise Scaling variants redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via linear interpolation during pre-training, achieving better performance than isotropic baselines with similar computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformer models use uniform layer sizes, ignoring the diverse functional roles and computational capacity needs at different depths.

Method: Introduced three LWS variants (Framed, Reverse, Crown) using two or three-point linear interpolation to redistribute FFN widths and attention heads during pre-training on 5B tokens with 180M parameters.

Result: All models converged to similar losses and achieved better performance compared to equal-cost isotropic baseline without substantial decrease in training throughput.

Conclusion: This represents an initial step into layer-wise architecture design for pre-training, but future work needs scaling to more tokens and parameters to fully assess potential.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAMDAS uses LLMs as implicit classifiers for domain-specific data selection, outperforming full-data training and SOTA baselines with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation of LLMs faces data scarcity issues, and existing data selection methods struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Leverages pre-trained LLM as implicit classifier for one-class classification, using small reference dataset to identify domain-relevant data without explicit feature engineering.

Result: Exceeds full-data training performance using fraction of data, outperforms 9 SOTA baselines across various scenarios with best performance-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: LAMDAS provides an effective and efficient solution for domain-specific data selection, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

TL;DR: SLiNT is a modular framework that injects knowledge graph structural context into frozen LLMs using LoRA adaptation for improved link prediction, addressing structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with structural signals in knowledge graphs, leading to structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity, especially in incomplete or zero-shot settings.

Method: Proposes SLiNT framework with three components: Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement for enriching sparse entities, Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning for fine-grained supervision, and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection for token-level structure-aware intervention while preserving LLM parameters.

Result: Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared to both embedding-based and generation-based baselines.

Conclusion: SLiNT demonstrates the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion by effectively integrating structural context with LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

### [260] [HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06596)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE is a parameter-free decoding framework that reduces LLM hallucinations by adaptively weighting attention heads and calibrating value vectors to better align token evidence with model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented or long-context generation even when relevant evidence is present, due to input-agnostic head importance treatment and poor reflection of true token contribution by raw attention weights.

Method: HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating (instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads) and value calibration (augmenting attention with value vector magnitude to approximate write-back contribution), fused with LM distribution through uncertainty-scaled policy.

Result: Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families show HAVE consistently reduces hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines including DAGCD with modest overhead.

Conclusion: HAVE is an efficient, transparent, and broadly applicable framework that advances trustworthy generation in real-world settings without requiring finetuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Result: Revealed unexpected performance variations across methods and multi-turn interactions, providing insights into how guided decoding performs in different prompting scenarios.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of structured output generation in RAG systems and offers practical guidance for method selection in LLM deployment based on specific use cases.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has

applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intertextuality is fundamental in literary studies but lacks scalable quantitative methods for analysis. Current approaches don't enable systematic comparison of text relationships at scale.

Method: Perform pairwise comparisons of n-gram embeddings from two texts and average the results to compute overall intertextuality score. Use network analysis to reveal centrality and community structures.

Result: Method validated on four texts with known intertextuality degrees and scaled to 267 diverse texts. Shows effectiveness, efficiency, and successfully captures intertextual relationships through network structures.

Conclusion: The proposed quantitative model enables scalable analysis of intertextuality, providing network-based insights and systematic measurement of literary text relationships.

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains through its innovative training approach and fusion strategies.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

*Xingwei Tan,Mahathi Parvatham,Chiara Gambi,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntrEx dataset for analyzing interestingness in educational conversations, showing fine-tuned LLMs outperform larger models in predicting engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in understanding linguistic features that drive engagement in educational conversations, as prior research focused mainly on text interestingness rather than conversational engagement.

Method: Created IntrEx dataset with sequence-level annotations from teacher-student interactions, using comparison-based rating with 100+ second-language learners inspired by RLHF. Tested LLMs' ability to predict interestingness judgments.

Result: Fine-tuned 7B/8B parameter LLMs outperformed larger proprietary models like GPT-4o in predicting human interestingness ratings. Analyzed linguistic factors (concreteness, comprehensibility, uptake) influencing engagement.

Conclusion: Specialized datasets like IntrEx enable effective modeling of engagement in educational dialogues, with fine-tuned smaller models showing superior performance over larger general-purpose models.

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Conclusion: ParCzech4Speech 1.0 provides a valuable resource for Czech speech processing with enhanced data quality and flexible formatting options, available through LINDAT repository and Hugging Face.

Abstract: We introduce ParCzech4Speech 1.0, a processed version of the ParCzech 4.0
corpus, targeted at speech modeling tasks with the largest variant containing
2,695 hours. We combined the sound recordings of the Czech parliamentary
speeches with the official transcripts. The recordings were processed with
WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our
processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version
by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is
offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech
recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented
preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment
for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain
the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The
dataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and
unsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.

*Amir Homayounirad,Enrico Liscio,Tong Wang,Catholijn M. Jonker,Luciano C. Siebert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Direct subjectivity identification outperforms value prediction for flagging subjective arguments in value recognition tasks, with contrastive loss reducing dependency on per-label subjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aggregating multiple annotations into single labels hides valuable insights into annotator disagreement, especially in subjective tasks like recognizing human values in arguments.

Method: Evaluated two approaches: inferring subjectivity through value prediction vs. direct subjectivity identification. Tested combining contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss.

Result: Direct subjectivity identification significantly improves model performance for flagging subjective arguments. Contrastive loss + binary cross-entropy doesn't improve performance but reduces dependency on per-label subjectivity.

Conclusion: Proposed methods help identify arguments with differing interpretations, enabling more nuanced annotation processes for subjective tasks.

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

### [267] [Anchoring Refusal Direction: Mitigating Safety Risks in Tuning via Projection Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06795)
*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Qika Lin,Kai He,Ting Liu,Bing Qin,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCon method uses projection-constrained loss to prevent refusal direction drift during instruction fine-tuning, enhancing LLM safety while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) compromises LLM safety by causing refusal direction drift, which weakens models' ability to reject malicious instructions.

Method: ProCon introduces projection-constrained loss to regularize hidden state projections onto refusal direction, with warm-up strategy for early strong constraints and broadened data distribution.

Result: ProCon significantly mitigates safety risks from IFT while preserving task performance gains, outperforming strong baselines across various datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: The method stabilizes refusal direction during training and provides interpretability-driven foundation for future LLM safety research.

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

### [268] [MachineLearningLM: Continued Pretraining Language Models on Millions of Synthetic Tabular Prediction Tasks Scales In-Context ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06806)
*Haoyu Dong,Pengkun Zhang,Mingzhe Lu,Yanzhen Shen,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM is a continued-pretraining framework that enhances LLMs' in-context learning for ML tasks using synthetic data from structural causal models, achieving strong performance on tabular classification while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with many-shot in-context learning on standard ML tasks despite their general knowledge and reasoning abilities. There's a need to equip LLMs with robust ML capabilities while maintaining their broader chat functionality.

Method: Uses continued pretraining with ML tasks synthesized from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), distills tree-based decision strategies from random forest teachers, and employs token-efficient prompting for 3-6x more examples per context window.

Result: Outperforms strong LLM baselines by ~15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across multiple domains, shows monotonic accuracy improvement from 8 to 1,024 shots, achieves random-forest-level accuracy, and maintains 75.4% on MMLU.

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM successfully equips general-purpose LLMs with robust in-context ML capability while preserving general knowledge and reasoning, demonstrating effective many-shot scaling and strong performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

### [269] [MoGU V2: Toward a Higher Pareto Frontier Between Model Usability and Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06807)
*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Ting Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoGU_v2 framework improves LLM security without sacrificing usability by using intelligent routing between security-optimized and usability-optimized model variants, with embedded routers in key layers and bidirectional adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM security methods often lead to overly conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability, creating a need to advance the Pareto frontier between security and usability rather than forcing trade-offs.

Method: MoGU_v2 framework with intra-layer routers that dynamically allocate weights based on hidden states, embedding routers only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, and activating backbone modules during router optimization for bidirectional adaptation.

Result: MoGU_v2 demonstrates strong adaptability and stable improvements across various LLM types (mainstream, on-device, reasoning), maintains security even with instruction fine-tuning risks, and preserves task performance through simple data-mix strategy.

Conclusion: MoGU_v2 provides a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world LLM applications while maintaining usability, representing a significant advancement in balancing these critical objectives.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

*Valentin Quesnel,Damien Sileo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that converts automated theorem proving research into scalable, guaranteed-valid mathematical reasoning data using E-prover on TPTP axioms, creating three difficulty-controlled challenges to address LLMs' weaknesses in structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck for advancing mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Current approaches relying on error-prone LLMs or complex proof-assistant syntax are insufficient.

Method: Leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the TPTP axiom library to derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. The pipeline involves saturating axioms, filtering for "interesting" theorems, and generating tasks without using LLMs to eliminate factual errors.

Result: Created three difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection, and proof reconstruction. Zero-shot experiments on frontier models revealed performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework provides both a diagnostic tool to measure the reasoning gap in LLMs and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address mathematical reasoning weaknesses. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

### [271] [A Comparative Benchmark of Large Language Models for Labelling Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06813)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Alasdair McDonald,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for benchmarking LLMs on wind turbine maintenance log classification, showing performance hierarchy and recommending human-in-the-loop systems for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured free-text maintenance logs present barriers to automated analysis in wind power O&M, requiring effective classification methods to reduce LCOE.

Method: Novel reproducible framework for benchmarking diverse LLMs (proprietary and open-source) on industrial record classification, evaluating reliability, efficiency, and calibration.

Result: Clear performance hierarchy identified with top models showing high alignment with benchmark standards and trustworthy confidence scores. Performance depends on semantic ambiguity - better on objective component identification than interpretive maintenance actions.

Conclusion: No model achieves perfect accuracy and calibration varies, so human-in-the-loop systems are recommended where LLMs assist human experts to accelerate data labeling and enhance O&M data quality.

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

### [272] [COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836)
*Eugene Kwek,Wenpeng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPACT is a joint pruning method that combines vocabulary pruning and FFN channel pruning to make LLMs more efficient while maintaining standard transformer architecture and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Making LLMs more efficient for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale by addressing limitations of prior pruning methods (width pruning breaks transformer layout, depth pruning causes accuracy drops).

Method: Jointly prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding layers and prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations that align importance with post-pruning token distribution.

Result: State-of-the-art downstream task performance across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) at similar/higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: COMPACT combines benefits of both depth and width pruning while being deployment-friendly, scale-adaptive, training-free, and achieving strong memory savings with throughput gains.

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces EPT metric to evaluate LLM trustworthiness in Persian context across 6 dimensions, revealing significant safety deficiencies in leading models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show remarkable performance but ensuring trustworthiness remains critical, especially for alignment with ethical, cultural and social values. Need for culturally grounded evaluation criteria.

Method: Developed EPT benchmark with labeled dataset to assess trustworthiness across truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. Evaluated ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen using both automated LLM-based and human assessments.

Result: Revealed significant deficiencies in the safety dimension across evaluated models. Provides insights into alignment with Persian ethical-cultural values and identifies critical gaps.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent need for focused attention on safety aspects and provides valuable benchmark for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI in Persian context.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

*Wenting Zhao,Pranjal Aggarwal,Swarnadeep Saha,Asli Celikyilmaz,Jason Weston,Ilia Kulikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AggLM learns to aggregate multiple LLM solutions using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, outperforming majority voting and reward models while requiring fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like majority voting or reward model ranking provide limited benefits for aggregating multiple LLM solutions to reasoning tasks.

Method: Train an aggregator model using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards to review, reconcile, and synthesize final answers from candidate solutions, with careful balancing of easy and hard training examples.

Result: AggLM outperforms rule-based and reward-model baselines across multiple benchmarks, generalizes to solutions from different models including stronger ones, and requires substantially fewer tokens than majority voting.

Conclusion: Learning aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill through reinforcement learning with balanced training examples is an effective approach for improving LLM performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: To explore different prompting and in-context learning methods for extracting check-worthy claims from social media passages in the CheckThat! Task 2 English competition.

Method: Tested various prompting techniques including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning with different LLM families, with FLAN-T5 fine-tuning as the primary approach.

Result: Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 achieved the best METEOR score, but other methods sometimes extracted higher-quality claims despite having lower automated evaluation scores.

Conclusion: While automated metrics like METEOR favor fine-tuned models, human evaluation reveals that other prompting methods can sometimes produce superior quality claims, suggesting limitations in current evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of
prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning
with different LLM families, with the goal of extracting check-worthy claims
from social media passages. Our best METEOR score is achieved by fine-tuning a
FLAN-T5 model. However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be
extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mmBERT is a new multilingual encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens across 1800+ languages, featuring novel techniques like inverse mask ratio schedule and inverse temperature sampling that achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been a lack of recent research on encoder-only multilingual models, despite their widespread use in standard ML tasks like classification and retrieval.

Method: Pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text using novel techniques: inverse mask ratio schedule, inverse temperature sampling ratio, and adding 1700+ low-resource languages only during the decay phase to maximize performance gains.

Result: Achieves similar classification performance to OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, significantly outperforms previous generation models on both high and low-resource languages for classification and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: mmBERT demonstrates that strategic training techniques and phased inclusion of low-resource languages can dramatically boost multilingual encoder model performance, making it competitive with much larger models.

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

### [277] [Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902)
*Aivin V. Solatorio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN) is a presentation-layer protocol that ensures numeric fidelity in LLM outputs through mechanical verification, preventing numeric hallucinations by requiring proof verification before display.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safeguards like retrieval-augmented generation and citations improve transparency but cannot guarantee numeric fidelity, as LLMs may still generate fabricated or misquoted numbers that appear correct.

Method: PCN emits numeric spans as claim-bound tokens tied to structured claims, with a verifier that checks each token under declared policies (exact equality, rounding, tolerance, etc.). Verification occurs at the renderer level, not the model level, ensuring fail-closed behavior.

Result: PCN provides soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. It is lightweight, model-agnostic, and integrates seamlessly into existing applications.

Conclusion: PCN establishes a trust contract where numeric trust is earned only through proof verification, while unverified numbers communicate uncertainty, making it suitable for numerically sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Li Shen,Jing Bai,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bilevel optimization method that combines SFT and RL training for LLM reasoning, enabling SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL optimization for better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupled two-stage approach (SFT warm-up followed by RL) limits interaction between training paradigms, constraining overall effectiveness and suffering from RL's trial-and-error inefficiency.

Method: Bilevel optimization that conditions SFT objective on optimal RL policy. Lower level performs RL updates while receiving SFT supervision, upper level maximizes cooperative gain of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone.

Result: Outperforms baselines on five reasoning benchmarks, achieving better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel optimization approach facilitates better cooperation between SFT and RL training, leading to improved reasoning model performance with enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: TraceRL is a trajectory-aware RL framework for diffusion language models that improves reasoning performance on math and coding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller models compared to larger AR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diffusion language models' reasoning capabilities by incorporating preferred inference trajectories into post-training, making them more effective for complex tasks while maintaining architectural flexibility.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based value model for stable training, applies trajectory-aware reinforcement learning across different architectures, and employs curriculum learning to create long-chain-of-thought models.

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct outperforms 7B-scale AR models on math reasoning. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves 6.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-7B and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B. First long-CoT DLM shows 18.1% accuracy gain on MATH500.

Conclusion: TraceRL effectively enhances diffusion language models' reasoning performance, demonstrating that smaller DLMs can outperform larger AR models, with released open-source framework enabling reproducible research and practical applications.

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation framework for testing language models' pragmatic reasoning using Wavelength game, showing large LMs achieve human-like comprehension and RSA improves production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand language models' pragmatic reasoning abilities as they become conversational agents, since language use is shaped by communicative goals and norms.

Method: Proposed evaluation framework based on Wavelength communication game, testing LMs on comprehension and production using direct prompting, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Rational Speech Act (RSA) approach with Bayesian pragmatic reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art LMs achieved human-like accuracy in comprehension without CoT or RSA. For production, CoT outperformed direct prompting, and RSA provided significant improvements over both approaches.

Conclusion: The study identifies strengths/limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning and demonstrates RSA's potential for improvement, opening avenues for understanding conceptual representation and social reasoning in both LMs and humans.

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

### [282] [Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05316)
*Praveen Bushipaka,Lucia Passaro,Tommaso Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of LLM unlearning practices reveals that single neighbor sets and standard 1:1 sampling are suboptimal, leading to proposed best practices including diverse neighbor sets and a Modular Entity-Level Unlearning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM unlearning benchmarks use oversimplified approaches with single neighbor sets and standard sampling methods that fail to reflect real-world data complexities and relationships, with their efficacy and stability not properly examined.

Method: Systematically evaluated common unlearning practices, analyzed performance trade-offs, and proposed/validated best practices including diverse neighbor sets, alternative to cyclic sampling, and Modular Entity-Level Unlearning (MELU) strategy with robust algorithms.

Result: Found that single neighbor set reliance is suboptimal, standard 1:1 sampling is inefficient and yields poor results, and that the proposed modular approach provides clear and stable path to effective unlearning.

Conclusion: Diverse neighbor sets and the MELU strategy offer improved balance between forget efficacy and model utility, providing more effective and stable unlearning compared to conventional practices.

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel robust fine-tuning method that constrains function space distance and uses consistency regularization to improve both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness across various CLIP backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fine-tuning methods that preserve pretrained weights, features, or logits cannot consistently improve OOD robustness across different model architectures, as they serve as poor proxies for function space optimization.

Method: Proposes two regularizations: 1) constraining distance between fine-tuning and pre-trained models in function space using simulated OOD samples, and 2) consistency regularization to promote stable predictions for perturbed samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently improves both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across various CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed function space regularization approach effectively preserves pre-trained model's OOD robustness while achieving competitive in-distribution performance, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

### [284] [Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429)
*Jie Fu,Hong Yuan,Zhili Chen,Wendy Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals GNNs' vulnerability to topology privacy attacks and proposes a defense framework called PGR that protects graph structure confidentiality while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks raise serious privacy concerns, particularly around topology privacy (confidentiality of graph structure), which is underexplored compared to edge-level privacy.

Method: Proposes Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) to demonstrate vulnerability, then introduces Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR) - a bi-level optimization framework that iteratively generates synthetic training graphs using meta-gradients while updating the GNN model.

Result: GNNs are highly susceptible to topology inference attacks, existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient, and PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy.

Conclusion: Topology privacy is a critical threat in GNNs that requires specialized defense mechanisms like PGR, which effectively protects graph structure confidentiality while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: memTrace framework uses internal transformer representations (hidden states and attention patterns) to achieve strong membership inference attacks (AUC 0.85), showing LLMs leak training data privacy through internal behaviors despite output-level protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies suggest MIAs perform poorly against large language models, indicating modern pre-training may be privacy-safe. This work explores whether internal model representations rather than just outputs can reveal membership signals.

Method: memTrace framework analyzes transformer hidden states and attention patterns, examining layer-wise representation dynamics, attention distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns to detect memorization fingerprints.

Result: Achieves strong membership detection with average AUC scores of 0.85 across several model families on popular MIA benchmarks, significantly outperforming traditional loss-based approaches.

Conclusion: Internal model behaviors can reveal training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected, highlighting the need for further privacy research and more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical data is heavily skewed toward music, making it challenging to deliver balanced and personalized content mix. User preferences vary by time of day, day of week, and device used.

Method: Proposed calibration method using contextual bandits to dynamically learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and preferences, rather than relying on historical averages.

Result: Both offline and online results demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page, particularly with underrepresented content types such as podcasts.

Conclusion: The contextual bandit approach successfully adapts to how users' interests in different content types vary across contexts, boosting engagement compared to traditional calibration methods.

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS is a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework for multivariate time series that models irregular latent states and their transitions using multi-granularity patching, contrastive learning, and next-transition prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods for multivariate time series neglect periodic structures and fail to capture dynamic evolution of latent states, while facing challenges from high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature.

Method: Uses period-aware multi-granularity patching, generalized contrastive loss for instance-level and state-level similarities, and next-transition prediction pretext task to capture temporal dynamics and future state evolution.

Result: PLanTS consistently improves representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed periodicity-aware framework effectively addresses limitations of current SSL approaches for multivariate time series by explicitly modeling latent state transitions and periodic structures.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Biomolecular Neural Networks is challenging due to lack of target data, and STL specifications can provide alternative training objectives for biological applications.

Method: Leveraging quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal Logic to enable gradient-based optimization of BNN weights, with learning algorithms for regression and control tasks in biological systems.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate efficient solution of regression tasks (detecting dysregulated states) and control tasks (reducing inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to infections).

Conclusion: STL-based learning enables effective training of BNNs for biological applications without traditional target data, demonstrating capabilities in both regression and feedback control scenarios.

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data distribution affects model performance and develop a method to assess prediction confidence on unseen data without requiring model retraining.

Method: Analyze training set embeddings to measure distance from training distribution, filter low-confidence predictions based on embedding distance, and use multiple embedding models for robust confidence estimation.

Result: Significant improvement in classification accuracy across multiple model architectures, with further gains achieved by combining complementary embeddings for better out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic framework effectively improves prediction reliability by leveraging embedding space analysis, with potential applications extending beyond computer vision to other domains like NLP.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mamba models on MCUs is challenging due to limited memory, lack of native operator support, and absence of embedded-friendly toolchains

Method: Created MambaLite-Micro - a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine that exports PyTorch weights to lightweight format, implements handcrafted Mamba layer with operator fusion and memory layout optimization

Result: Reduced 83.0% peak memory, maintained average numerical error of 1.7x10-5, achieved 100% consistency with PyTorch baselines on KWS and HAR tasks, validated on ESP32S3 and STM32H7 MCUs

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated portable deployment of Mamba models across heterogeneous embedded platforms, enabling advanced sequence models in resource-constrained applications

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAR is a self-aligned reward signal that combines with verifiable rewards to improve both reasoning accuracy and efficiency in LLMs by favoring concise, query-specific responses through perplexity difference scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifiable rewards provide only binary correctness feedback, leading to inefficient verbose reasoning and high computational costs while often compromising accuracy.

Method: SAR is defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on the query and the standalone answer, favoring concise and query-specific responses. It integrates with RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO.

Result: Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows 4% accuracy improvement and 30% reduction in inference cost. SAR achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness and efficiency while preserving advanced reasoning behaviors.

Conclusion: SAR serves as an effective fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, enabling more efficient and effective LLM training by suppressing unnecessary elaboration without losing critical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

*Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLA introduces a hierarchical RL framework with anticipation model and value geometric consistency for stable long-horizon goal achievement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of hierarchical RL in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks, including instability in automatic hierarchy discovery and lack of theoretical guarantees.

Method: Learn two models: low-level goal-conditioned policy for reaching subgoals, and high-level anticipation model as planner proposing optimal path subgoals. Uses value geometric consistency regularization.

Result: Theoretical proofs show RLA approaches globally optimal policy under various conditions, providing principled and convergent hierarchical planning.

Conclusion: RLA offers a scalable, theoretically-grounded framework for stable hierarchical reinforcement learning in long-horizon tasks with convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

*Sadegh Jafari,Aishwarya Sarkar,Mohiuddin Bilwal,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent is an LLM-based agentic system that automates model compression through profiling-guided pruning and quantization, achieving significant memory savings and speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face compute and memory bottlenecks on resource-limited platforms, and existing compression techniques use uniform heuristics that ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity.

Method: A profiling-guided, agentic approach using LLMs to automate compression via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization, with a modular multi-agent system that reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameters) and dynamic signals (latency, memory).

Result: Pruning maintains competitive or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with <0.5% accuracy loss and 1.74x inference speedups.

Conclusion: Agentic systems are scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization, with LLM reasoning quality being crucial for iterative pruning success.

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

*Xiaoguang Zhu,Lianlong Sun,Yang Liu,Pengyi Jiang,Uma Srivatsa,Nipavan Chiamvimonvat,Vladimir Filkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal framework for medical multimodal learning that addresses missingness and distribution biases through structural causal analysis and dual-branch neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets often have missing modalities due to various constraints, and existing methods neglect the underlying biases introduced by the data acquisition process, which hinders model generalization.

Method: Structural causal analysis of data-generating process with two components: (1) missingness deconfounding module using backdoor adjustment for causal intervention, and (2) dual-branch neural network that disentangles causal features from spurious correlations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and providing causal insights.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively addresses missingness and distribution biases in medical multimodal learning, improving generalization and offering causal understanding of the data.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

TL;DR: OptiProxy-NAS is a novel neural architecture search method that uses optimization proxies to transform the discrete NAS space into continuous, differentiable space, enabling gradient-based optimization for efficient architecture search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural architecture search is computationally expensive with discrete, vast search spaces. Current methods use surrogate models or supernetworks, but there's a need for more efficient end-to-end optimization approaches.

Method: Proposes OptiProxy-NAS framework that uses proxy representations to reformulate NAS space as continuous, differentiable, and smooth, allowing application of differentiable optimization methods to search architecture parameters.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 12 NAS tasks across 4 search spaces in computer vision, NLP, and resource-constrained domains show superior search results and efficiency. Also verified flexibility in low-fidelity scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization proxy approach successfully transforms NAS into an end-to-end differentiable optimization problem, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple domains and search scenarios.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

### [297] [DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663)
*Lucas Correia,Jan-Christoph Goos,Thomas Bäck,Anna V. Kononova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning approach for time series anomaly detection that uses a novel dissimilarity-based query strategy to improve threshold selection without requiring fully labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods suffer from poor threshold selection, and while some claim to be unsupervised, they still require labeled data for calibration which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates active learning with unsupervised anomaly detection by selectively querying labels using a novel dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS) that maximizes sample diversity through dynamic time warping similarity evaluation of anomaly scores.

Result: DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, all query strategies outperform unsupervised thresholds even with mislabelling, though other strategies are more robust to mislabelling than DQS.

Conclusion: Active learning-based threshold selection is recommended whenever feasible, with query strategy choice depending on oracle expertise and labeling budget - DQS for small budgets, other strategies when mislabelling is a concern.

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

*Labani Halder,Tanmay Sen,Sarbani Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraMFedDHAR - a graph-based multimodal federated learning framework for human activity recognition that uses GCNs and attention fusion to handle heterogeneous sensor data while maintaining privacy through differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in HAR including noisy/incomplete multimodal sensor data, limited labeled examples, privacy concerns, and limitations of traditional centralized and federated learning approaches with heterogeneous data.

Method: Model diverse sensor streams as modality-specific graphs, process through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, fuse via attention-based weighting (not simple concatenation), and apply differential privacy during federated aggregation.

Result: MultiModalGCN outperforms baseline MultiModalFFN by up to 2% higher accuracy in non-DP settings, and shows 7-13% performance improvements under differential privacy constraints across various privacy budgets.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling with GNNs proves more robust to performance degradation from DP noise, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based approaches for multimodal learning in privacy-preserving federated settings.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed training method combining data parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation to accelerate DNN training by processing more data per iteration and reducing locking issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks require substantial training time due to increasing depth and large datasets, creating a need for more efficient training methods.

Method: Integrates data parallelism with fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm using multiple computational units operating in parallel.

Result: Proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions and demonstrated effectiveness through empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed training method significantly improves training efficiency by enhancing data processing and mitigating backpropagation locking issues.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training morphological perceptrons with competitive layers, addressing non-differentiability issues through DC programming and linear programming subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morphological perceptrons with competitive layers (MPCL) are unsuitable for gradient-based optimization due to non-differentiable morphological operators, requiring alternative training strategies.

Method: Formulates training as a difference of convex (DC) functions problem and solves iteratively using convex-concave procedure (CCP), resulting in sequence of linear programming subproblems.

Result: Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCP training method for MPCL networks in classification tasks.

Conclusion: CCP provides an effective gradient-free optimization approach for training morphological neural networks with competitive output layers.

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-principles models often fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions, while deep learning requires large datasets. There's a need for methods that can efficiently learn complex dynamics with limited data.

Method: SimPEL uses low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning, combining simulator knowledge with data-driven learning while quantifying epistemic uncertainty.

Result: SimPEL shows superior performance in learning complex dynamics across biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, and bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based reinforcement learning with substantially less data than baselines.

Conclusion: SimPEL demonstrates strong potential for data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments by effectively combining simulator knowledge with deep learning flexibility.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online agents outperform offline agents in model-based reinforcement learning due to Out-Of-Distribution state issues. Adding online interactions or exploration data can mitigate performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of online vs. offline data collection on world models in model-based reinforcement learning, as the performance differences haven't been thoroughly studied despite the theoretical suitability of offline training for task-agnostic dynamics learning.

Method: Conducted experiments on 31 different environments comparing online and offline training paradigms. Analyzed performance degradation causes and tested mitigation strategies including additional online interactions (fixed/adaptive schedules) and incorporating exploration data.

Result: Online agents consistently outperformed offline counterparts. Identified Out-Of-Distribution states at test time as the key performance degradation factor. Showed that limited online interactions or exploration data can restore performance to online training levels.

Conclusion: Recommend incorporating exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts focus too much on expert data alone. Online interactions or exploration data are crucial for mitigating the state distribution mismatch issue in offline training.

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Motivation: Anomaly detection faces two major obstacles: extreme class imbalance and curse of dimensionality, which impede progress in critical applications like network security and fraud prevention

Method: Integrates previously developed PRC Random Forest (designed for class imbalance) with autoencoders (for dimensionality reduction) to create a hybrid Autoencoder-PRC-RF model

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets show superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability compared to prior methods

Conclusion: The hybrid framework demonstrates strong potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks by effectively addressing both class imbalance and dimensionality challenges

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DCV-ROOD, a dual cross-validation framework for robust evaluation of OOD detection methods that handles in-distribution and out-of-distribution data differently and achieves fast convergence to true performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial for AI robustness but lacks rigorous evaluation frameworks. Cross-validation needs adaptation for OOD scenarios to properly assess model performance under diverse conditions.

Method: Dual CV framework that partitions ID data conventionally while grouping OOD data by classes. Considers class hierarchy for fair ID-OOD partitions. Tests framework on state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Result: The proposed DCV-ROOD framework achieves very fast convergence to the true performance of OOD detection methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust evaluation.

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD provides a reliable evaluation framework for OOD detection that properly handles the distinct characteristics of ID and OOD data, enabling more accurate assessment of model performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXO-ST introduces a novel framework for spatio-temporal forecasting that effectively models exogenous variables through a "select, then balance" paradigm using latent space gated experts and siamese network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatio-temporal forecasting solutions only use limited observed target variables, but real-world scenarios have exogenous variables that can improve accuracy. However, challenges include inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables and imbalance between historical and future variables.

Method: Constructs latent space gated expert module to dynamically select and recompose salient signals from fused exogenous information. Uses siamese network architecture with dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones and context-aware weighting mechanism to balance past and future exogenous variables.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency in spatio-temporal forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed EXO-ST framework successfully addresses the challenges of modeling exogenous variables in spatio-temporal forecasting through its innovative selection and balancing approach, showing superior performance across various real-world applications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

### [307] [time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events in Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05801)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aaryan Nagpal,Dhruv Kumar,Murari Mandal,Saurabh Deshpande*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer foundation models encode semantic concepts like market regimes, and their internal representations can be manipulated through activation transplantation to simulate rare events like market crashes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if transformer-based models internalize semantic concepts (like market regimes) beyond curve fitting, and whether their internal representations can be leveraged to simulate rare high-stakes events such as market crashes.

Method: Activation transplantation - a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing statistical moments from one event (e.g., historical crash) onto another (e.g., calm period) during forward pass.

Result: Models encode graded notion of event severity with latent vector norm correlating with systemic shock magnitude. Validated across Toto (decoder-only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder) architectures, showing steerable semantically grounded representations are robust properties.

Conclusion: Large time series transformers have a latent concept space that governs predictions, enabling direct causal intervention for semantic "what-if" analysis and strategic stress-testing, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct manipulation.

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

### [308] [Simple Optimizers for Convex Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05811)
*Ben Kretzu,Karen Ullrich,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper relaxes strong convexity assumptions in aligned multi-objective optimization, developing new gradient-descent algorithms with convergence guarantees under standard smoothness/Lipschitz conditions more relevant to deep learning practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMOO analysis relies on strong convexity assumptions that imply unique optimal solutions, which doesn't align with deep learning practice where objectives may not be inherently conflicting and diverse tasks can enhance performance.

Method: Developed new analytical tools and metrics to characterize convergence in convex AMOO setting, proposed scalable gradient-descent algorithms under standard smoothness or Lipschitz continuity conditions.

Result: Established convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms and proved a novel lower bound showing suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to their methods.

Conclusion: The work generalizes AMOO analysis to more practical assumptions consistent with deep learning, providing theoretically sound gradient-based methods with better performance than naive approaches.

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

### [309] [Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05826)
*Misgina Tsighe Hagos,Claes Lundström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction shows weak correlation with human-annotated aleatoric uncertainty, questioning its effectiveness in capturing inherent dataset ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether conformal prediction effectively quantifies aleatoric uncertainty (inherent dataset ambiguity from overlapping classes) as claimed in literature, since there's a lack of empirical validation.

Method: Used three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight deep learning models on four datasets with multiple human annotations per instance. Measured correlation between prediction set sizes and number of distinct human-assigned labels, and assessed similarity between prediction sets and human annotations.

Result: Vast majority of conformal prediction outputs showed very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation. Prediction sets provide coverage but poorly capture aleatoric uncertainty.

Conclusion: Conformal predictors' capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty is limited, necessitating critical reassessment of their prediction sets despite providing good coverage of true classes.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

*Akaash Kolluri,Shengguang Wu,Joon Sung Park,Michael S. Bernstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finetuning LLMs on social science experiment data (SocSci210 dataset with 2.9M responses) significantly improves simulation accuracy, achieving 26% better alignment with human responses than base models and outperforming GPT-4o by 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for more accurate simulations of social science experiments by finetuning them directly on individual-level responses from past experiments.

Method: Created SocSci210 dataset with 2.9M responses from 400K participants across 210 experiments, then finetuned Qwen2.5-14B model on this data to create Socrates-Qwen-14B.

Result: 26% improvement in alignment with human response distributions vs base model, 13% better than GPT-4o, 71% improvement in generalization to unseen conditions, and 10.6% reduction in demographic bias.

Conclusion: Finetuning on social science datasets enables more accurate experimental simulations and hypothesis screening, with strong generalization capabilities and reduced bias.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at
stanfordhci.github.io/socrates.

Motivation: Existing FL benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to decentralized gradient marketplaces, particularly cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market stability when buyers rely on private baseline datasets.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark framework including: (1) simulation environment modeling marketplace dynamics, (2) evaluation methodology with marketplace-centric metrics, (3) empirical analysis of MartFL framework with adapted FLTrust and SkyMask aggregation strategies, and (4) analysis across diverse datasets and attack scenarios.

Result: The benchmark provides tools and empirical evidence to evaluate trade-offs between model performance, robustness, cost, fairness, and stability in gradient marketplaces.

Conclusion: This benchmark equips the community to design more robust, equitable, and economically viable decentralized gradient marketplaces by addressing previously overlooked economic and systemic factors.

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical

TL;DR: Data-driven framework using autoregressive sequence models to automate queueing network modeling from event-stream data, eliminating need for manual specification of arrival processes, service mechanisms, and routing logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing network models require substantial human effort and domain expertise to construct, making them less scalable and accessible. The goal is to leverage AI advances and growing data availability to create more automated modeling pipelines.

Method: Proposes using Transformer-style architectures to parameterize conditional distributions of event types and event times, recasting queueing network modeling as a sequence distribution learning problem trained on event-stream data.

Result: The framework enables automated construction of high-fidelity simulators and has been validated on diverse queueing networks, demonstrating utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual evaluation.

Conclusion: This approach represents a step toward more automated, data-driven modeling pipelines that can support broader adoption of queueing network models across various service domains.

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

### [313] [The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865)
*Rishabh Dixit,Yuan Hui,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial forging in machine unlearning, showing that the set of data points that can forge target gradients is small and scales with tolerance ϵ, making false unlearning claims detectable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require machine unlearning to remove specific data from trained models, but adversaries can forge data to mimic unlearning without actually removing information.

Method: Developed a framework to analyze ϵ-forging sets (data points whose gradients approximate target gradients within tolerance ϵ) for linear regression and neural networks, with extensions to batch SGD and smooth loss functions.

Result: The Lebesgue measure of forging sets scales as ϵ^{(d-r)/2} where d is data dimension and r is nullity of gradient variation matrix. Probability bounds show random sampling of forging points is vanishingly small.

Conclusion: Adversarial forging is fundamentally limited, and false unlearning claims can be detected due to the small measure and low probability of forging sets.

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

TL;DR: A surrogate model using machine learning techniques predicts convective heat transfer coefficients for liquid sodium in miniature heat sinks with ~8% error, offering a faster alternative to CFD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity CFD modeling of turbulent forced convection for liquid metals is time-consuming and computationally expensive, necessitating efficient alternative tools for design optimization.

Method: Used kernel-based ML, shallow neural networks, self-supervised physics-informed neural network with adaptive physics weighting, and transfer learning from water data to sodium.

Result: Self-supervised physics-informed neural network achieved ~8% error margin; physics-only regression maintained 5-10% error; other ML methods also performed within ~8% error range.

Conclusion: Machine learning models provide an effective alternative to CFD for predicting heat transfer in liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks, enabling faster design and optimization processes.

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research community often overlooks the importance of database schema information for generating high-quality SQL queries, despite schema information playing a significant or even dominant role in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Proposed a database schema expert with two components: X-Linking (LLM Supervised Finetuning for schema linking) and X-Admin (for schema understanding by bridging schema information with natural language questions). Also used Multi-LLMs for different components to boost performance.

Result: Achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on Spider-Dev dataset and 82.5% on Spider-Test dataset, establishing X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Conclusion: X-SQL demonstrates that proper handling of database schema information through specialized components and multi-LLM integration significantly improves Text-to-SQL performance, setting new state-of-the-art results for open-source models.

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world scenarios like AI cluster workload scheduling where operators must balance long-term service agreements against sudden demand spikes while handling uncertainty.

Method: Developed BEST algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT, then introduced CoRT learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions from ML models.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CoRT strictly improves over BEST when predictions are accurate while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. Case study validates effectiveness in workload scheduling.

Conclusion: The SOOTT framework and proposed algorithms effectively balance trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to disturbances, providing robust online optimization for dynamic target tracking problems.

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

TL;DR: UIFM is a foundation model that treats multi-attribute events as single semantic units through composite tokenization, enabling better behavioral understanding than text-serialized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models designed for natural language fail to grasp holistic structured interactions in domains like telecommunications, e-commerce and finance, as they serialize events into text and lose critical context.

Method: Composite tokenization where each multi-attribute event is treated as a single, semantically coherent unit, allowing the model to learn the underlying "grammar" of user behavior.

Result: The architecture is more accurate and represents a fundamental step towards creating more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Conclusion: UIFM enables genuine behavioral understanding by perceiving entire interactions rather than disconnected data streams, advancing AI's ability to understand and predict complex event sequences.

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

TL;DR: PolicyEvolve is a framework that uses LLMs to generate interpretable programmatic policies for multi-agent games, reducing computational costs and improving policy interpretability through iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL requires massive computational resources and produces black-box policies that lack interpretability, limiting practical deployment. LLMs have shown success in generating interpretable policies for single-agent tasks, suggesting potential for multi-agent settings.

Method: Four-module framework: Global Pool (elite policies), Local Pool (temporary policies), Policy Planner (generates/refines policies using top policies and environmental info), Trajectory Critic (analyzes vulnerabilities and guides improvements). Iterative process refines policies until high win rate achieved.

Result: Significantly reduces reliance on manually crafted policy code and minimizes environmental interactions while achieving high-performance policies. Produces interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve provides an effective framework for generating high-performance, interpretable programmatic policies in multi-player games, addressing computational and interpretability limitations of traditional MARL approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Result: Experimental results reveal a clear correlation between time series properties and modeling strategies, enabling the creation of the first deep forecasting model recommender that provides interpretable suggestions.

Conclusion: ARIES is the first study to systematically establish relationships between time series data properties and modeling strategies while implementing a practical model recommendation system for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A surrogate model using fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict current density distribution in REBCO solenoids, achieving much faster predictions than FEM with good accuracy and generalization capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FEM becomes computationally expensive for large-scale HTS magnets, limiting rapid design of meter-scale REBCO magnet systems with multi-physics couplings.

Method: Developed a surrogate model based on fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) trained on datasets from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.

Result: FCRN with 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer provides best balance between accuracy and generalization. Model can predict magnetization losses up to 50% beyond training range with max errors below 10%, and is orders of magnitude faster than FEM.

Conclusion: The FCRN-based surrogate model offers both accuracy and efficiency, providing a promising tool for rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

*S. R. Eshwar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses theoretical and algorithmic gaps for reinforcement learning with quasi-hyperbolic discounting preferences, proving optimal policy structure and developing practical model-free algorithms with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-inconsistent preferences (favoring smaller-sooner over larger-later rewards) are common in human/animal decision-making, but quasi-hyperbolic discounting has been poorly integrated into reinforcement learning frameworks.

Method: The authors formally characterize the structure of optimal policy and design the first practical model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation and Q-learning with quasi-hyperbolic preferences.

Result: Proved that the optimal policy reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form, and developed algorithms with provable convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The results provide foundational insights for incorporating quasi-hyperbolic preferences in reinforcement learning, addressing key theoretical and algorithmic gaps.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of generative AI foundations, covering five major model families, probabilistic and game-theoretic frameworks, deployment considerations, and social responsibility aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish generation as a distinct machine learning task and provide a systematic framework for understanding what generation is as a ML problem, beyond just model implementations.

Method: Survey of five generative model families (autoregressive, VAE, normalizing flows, GANs, diffusion models), probabilistic framework distinguishing density estimation from generation, game-theoretic analysis with adversary-learner setup, and post-training deployment modifications.

Result: A unified task-first perspective on generative AI that connects generation to prediction, compression, and decision-making while addressing practical deployment and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: Generation should be understood as a fundamental ML task with distinct characteristics, requiring careful consideration of both technical implementations and social responsibilities including privacy, detection, and copyright issues.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

*Dibyajyoti Nayak,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) with explicit time-stepping significantly improve data efficiency and reduce error accumulation for learning PDE solutions compared to neural operators, achieving under 1% error with only 3% training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators require large datasets and struggle with scarce training data, while many formulations don't encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution. Autoregressive models preserve causality but suffer from error accumulation.

Method: Employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to model instantaneous time derivatives and learn PDE solutions. Introduces PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy.

Result: GNS achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples (3% of data) across three PDE systems. Reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% vs FNO and 99.86% vs DON. Significantly improves data efficiency and reduces error accumulation.

Conclusion: Combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs with superior data efficiency.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

*Aurora Polo-Rodríguez,Juan Carlos Valera,Jesús Peral,David Gil,Javier Medina-Quero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fingerprinting-based approach using UWB RSSI data and deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid) for accurate indoor human activity tracking in home environments, achieving ~50 cm mean absolute error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWB technology for indoor tracking is significantly affected by walls and obstacles, reducing precision. The study aims to overcome these challenges for better human activity recognition in residential settings.

Method: Used fingerprinting approach with RSSI data from UWB and Bluetooth in two flats (60m² and 100m²). Compared CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, and evaluated different temporal window types and durations.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error close to 50 cm, with the hybrid CNN+LSTM model showing superior performance in providing accurate location estimates.

Conclusion: The hybrid deep learning model with UWB fingerprinting enables accurate indoor tracking, facilitating practical application in daily human activity recognition for residential environments.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

*M. Rezaalipour,F. Costa,M. Biasion,R. Otoni,G. A. Constantinides,L. Pozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a methodology to reduce area of neural network arithmetic operators (adders/multipliers) via approximate computing, achieving better area savings with same accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balance energy consumption and accuracy in neural network deployment on edge devices through approximate computing techniques.

Method: Improves boolean rewriting technique (XPAT) with parametrizable template for circuit rewriting, introduces novel template based on parametrizable product sharing as proxy for synthesized area.

Result: Methodology converges better to low-area solutions and finds better approximations than original XPAT and other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively reduces arithmetic operator area in neural networks while maintaining accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: Visual analytics framework compares fused vs separate latent representations of urban data, finding fused representations produce more structured patterns while separate ones work better in specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban analytics faces challenges with granular, heterogeneous, multimodal data. While visualization tools exist for exploring fused data representations, there's limited understanding of whether fused representations provide deeper insights than examining data sources separately.

Method: Developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze the effectiveness of fused latent data representations versus separate representations for uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data.

Result: Analysis shows that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while separate representations are useful in particular cases.

Conclusion: Fused latent representations generally yield better structured patterns for urban data analysis, though separate representations have value in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

*Chuang Niu,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reasoning language model (RLM) that integrates radiology findings with medical records for improved lung cancer risk assessment, outperforming standard Lung-RADS by incorporating multiple risk factors through chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung-RADS has limitations in balancing sensitivity and specificity as it only considers lung nodule characteristics without incorporating various risk factors, necessitating a more comprehensive risk assessment approach.

Method: Developed a reasoning language model (RLM) through dataset construction, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and systematic evaluation. The model decomposes risk evaluation into sub-components, analyzes diverse risk factors, and synthesizes them into a final risk score using a data-driven system equation.

Result: Significant improvements in risk prediction performance on national lung screening trial datasets, with enhanced predictive accuracy and monitorability through chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: The RLM approach facilitates clinical translation into lung cancer screening by providing more accurate and interpretable risk assessment that integrates multiple risk factors beyond just nodule characteristics.

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Motivation: To develop agents that can simultaneously infer hidden governing rules and learn optimal policies in complex puzzle environments with partial observations.

Method: Used Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm with two state representation strategies: Feature-Centric (FC) and Object-Centric (OC) on a 6x6 board puzzle environment.

Result: Evaluated models across multiple rule-based and trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and representation impact on learning efficiency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of different state representation strategies in reinforcement learning for complex rule inference tasks with partial observability.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR)
environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden
rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We
explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and
trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact
of representation on learning efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentially private graph clustering methods suffer from high noise, low efficiency, and poor interpretability, which limit their practical development and application.

Method: Construct SDP optimization, extract key set using HST-based initialization method, apply k-median clustering strategy, and provide comparative explanations through cluster center differences.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses key challenges in differentially private graph clustering by providing better performance, efficiency, and interpretability while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF and PCC are closely related. PCC helps estimate stable NMF rank and resolve nonidentifiability, while NMF enables approximate PCC implementation for clustering and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reciprocal relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC) in probabilistic causality, and leverage this connection for improved data analysis.

Method: Used PCC as a predictability tool for robust NMF rank estimation, implemented NMF around this stable rank, and developed clustering methods where data points with same common cause are grouped together.

Result: PCC provides stable rank estimation resistant to weak noise, resolves NMF nonidentifiability problem, produces stable basis images, and enables effective clustering and denoising through the NMF-PCC connection.

Conclusion: The reciprocal relationship between NMF and PCC offers mutual benefits: PCC enhances NMF stability and identifiability, while NMF provides practical implementation of PCC for clustering and noise reduction in probabilistic models.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Motivation: Current public datasets for radio maps focus on SISO and limited path loss information, which is insufficient for advanced MIMO systems requiring detailed CSI. There's a need for large-scale, high-quality training data for ML-based radio map construction in 6G systems.

Method: The paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing that provides comprehensive complex CSI matrices across dense spatial grids in urban environments, going beyond traditional path loss data.

Result: The dataset offers rich CSI vital for constructing high-fidelity radio maps and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM generation. Baseline performance evaluations demonstrate the utility of the dataset for representative ML methods.

Conclusion: This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research in high-precision radio map generation, MIMO spatial performance, and machine learning for 6G environment awareness, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research

Result: 43.9% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest Claude model, with sub-150ms latency on a major cloud platform.

Conclusion: IPR provides an effective framework for quality-constrained LLM routing that significantly reduces costs while maintaining response quality and enabling rapid model integration.

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the

Method: Uses frozen LLM with lightweight adapters to generate text-conditioned embeddings from titles/attributes/reviews, combined with LightGCN for collaborative embeddings. Aligns both views with contrastive learning and fuses via intra-layer gating.

Result: Achieves best results on all eight metrics on Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, with up to +4.53% Recall@40 and +4.01% NDCG@40 improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines language and graph signals, with language dominating cold/long-tail scenarios and graph structure stabilizing mainstream recommendations.

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

*Shaoqi Wei,Senling Wang,Hiroshi Kai,Yoshinobu Higami,Ruijun Ma,Tianming Ni,Xiaoqing Wen,Hiroshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast prediction of fault impact probabilities in sequential circuits, reducing simulation time by 10x while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent Data Errors from defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems, and functional testing for these faults is expensive to simulate.

Method: Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing, using dedicated spatial and temporal encoders to predict multi-cycle fault impact probabilities efficiently.

Result: On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). Test-point selection using predicted FIPs improves detection of hard-to-detect faults.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient quantitative risk assessment, scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization, and fits downstream electronic design automation flows with configurable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

*Li Lin,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoaQ is a layer-wise post-training quantization method that focuses on output-level consistency rather than local approximations, achieving better alignment with quantization intuition through a closed-form solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional layer-wise PTQ methods only achieve activation-aware weight approximations, leading to insufficient approximations and deviations from the original quantization intuition of matching component outputs.

Method: Proposes LoaQ, an output-approximation method that explicitly targets output-level consistency by leveraging structural characteristics of LLMs, featuring a simple closed-form solution that integrates with existing quantization pipelines.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen model families show LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and weight-activation joint quantization, enhancing overall quantization quality when integrated with existing strategies.

Conclusion: LoaQ advances post-training quantization by better aligning with quantization intuition through output-level consistency, showing strong potential to push the frontier of PTQ techniques.

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

### [339] [WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311)
*Hang Fan,Yu Shi,Zongliang Fu,Shuo Chen,Wei Wei,Wei Xu,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WindFM is a lightweight generative foundation model for probabilistic wind power forecasting that uses a discretize-and-generate framework with transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wind forecasting models are either site-specific (lacking generalization) or require fine-tuning of general foundation models that cannot incorporate domain-specific energy data effectively.

Method: Uses a specialized time-series tokenizer to convert continuous multivariate observations into discrete hierarchical tokens, then trains a decoder-only Transformer on 150 billion time steps from 126,000+ sites in the WIND Toolkit dataset.

Result: The compact 8.1M parameter model achieves SOTA zero-shot performance on deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without fine-tuning, with strong adaptiveness to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: WindFM demonstrates robust and transferable learned representations for wind power forecasting, providing a foundation model specifically designed for the energy sector with publicly available pre-trained weights.

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at
https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.

*Mehmet Can Yavuz,Berrin Yanikoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new redundancy index rho(C) that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies in latent representations, providing a compact and statistically grounded measure of representational quality that predicts model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics like accuracy or reconstruction loss only provide indirect evidence and cannot isolate redundancy as a failure mode.

Method: Introduces a redundancy index rho(C) that analyzes coupling matrices derived from latent representations and compares their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance.

Result: Low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. The measure works across discriminative and generative settings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: rho(C) exposes redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, offering both a theoretical lens and practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations, with applications in neural architecture search and regularization.

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

*Jiajun Bao,Nicolas Boullé,Toni J. B. Liu,Raphaël Sarfati,Christopher J. Earls*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized PDE solutions without fine-tuning, showing improved accuracy with longer contexts but degradation at finer spatial resolutions, with error growth following neural scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how text-trained foundation models can perform zero-shot time-series forecasting and extrapolate PDE solutions without traditional fine-tuning or natural language prompts.

Method: Analyze LLM performance on discretized PDE solutions, examining predictive accuracy across different temporal contexts and spatial discretizations, and studying multi-step rollouts with error analysis.

Result: LLMs accurately extrapolate PDE dynamics with accuracy improving with longer contexts but degrading at finer spatial resolutions. Errors grow algebraically with time horizon, following neural scaling laws. Token analysis reveals a consistent ICL progression pattern.

Conclusion: Text-trained LLMs demonstrate emergent capability to process and extrapolate PDE solutions in-context, with predictable scaling behavior that resembles classical numerical methods, revealing a structured learning progression from pattern imitation to numerically grounded predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning with domain enrichment outperforms self-assessment in classifying meal alignment with nutritional goals using free-text meal logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision healthcare by automatically classifying patient-generated meal logs against nutritional goals using ML, addressing limitations of self-assessment.

Method: Used TFIDF and BERT text embeddings with domain enrichment (ontologies, ingredient parsers, macronutrient content) to train logistic regression and MLP classifiers on 3000+ meal records from 114 diverse participants.

Result: ML classifiers outperformed self-assessments, with best performance achieved using enrichment (Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, Macronutrients). Variability in performance across different nutritional goals.

Conclusion: ML can reliably classify meal-goal alignment from unstructured text, especially when incorporating nutrition domain knowledge, supporting patient-centered nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

*Roussel Rahman,Aashwin Ananda Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show strong numerical reasoning on algorithmic tasks but fail at combinatorial puzzles like Game of 24, revealing their limitations in generative problem-solving and creative numerical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of LLM numerical reasoning by testing performance across problems of escalating complexity, from basic arithmetic to combinatorial puzzles.

Method: Tested several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge with four categories: basic arithmetic, advanced operations, primality checking, and Game of 24 number puzzle.

Result: High accuracy on first three categories requiring deterministic algorithmic execution, but consistent failure on Game of 24 which requires heuristic search over large combinatorial space.

Conclusion: LLM numerical reasoning is confined to recalling and executing known algorithms rather than generative problem-solving, suggesting sophisticated pattern-matching rather than flexible analytical thought.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

### [344] [Ban&Pick: Achieving Free Performance Gains and Inference Speedup via Smarter Routing in MoE-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346)
*Yuanteng Chen,Peisong Wang,Yuantian Shao,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ban&Pick is a post-training plug-and-play strategy that improves MoE-LLM performance by reinforcing key experts and pruning redundant ones, achieving both accuracy gains and faster inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE routers converge prematurely and enforce balanced expert usage, limiting model performance and efficiency. Two key issues: underutilization of influential experts and fixed expert activation causing redundancy.

Method: Ban&Pick strategy with two components: Pick discovers and reinforces key influential experts; Ban dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements on Qwen3-30B-A3B: from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, with 1.25x inference acceleration under vLLM.

Conclusion: Ban&Pick provides free performance gains and inference acceleration for fine-grained MoE-LLMs without requiring retraining or architectural changes, demonstrating effective post-training optimization.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

manipulated to bypass detection, effectively rendering the protection
ineffective. Our analysis exposes vulnerabilities of on-device AI models and
provides a practical demonstration of how adversaries can exploit them.

TL;DR: Enhanced Variational Garrote (VG) method for sparse regression variable selection using statistical physics and variational inference, outperforms Ridge/LASSO in sparse regimes and identifies key variables through sharp transition analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for effective variable selection from high-dimensional data to promote model simplicity and explainability in big data era, revisiting underutilized statistical physics-based approach.

Method: Enhanced Variational Garrote with automatic differentiation for scalable optimization, introducing feature selection spin variables and variational inference for tractable loss function.

Result: VG performs best in highly sparse regimes, more consistent than Ridge/LASSO, shows sharp transition in generalization when superfluous variables are included, enabling estimation of correct variable count.

Conclusion: VG offers strong potential for sparse modeling applications including compressed sensing and machine learning model pruning, providing practical signal for identifying key predictors.

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

TL;DR: MGKD framework uses knowledge distillation with multi-granularity strategies to improve pre-service risk prediction by transferring insights from in-service user behavior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional financial risk management separates pre-service risk assessment and in-service default detection, missing opportunities to leverage in-service behavioral data for better pre-service predictions.

Method: Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (MGKD) with teacher-student architecture, using soft labels from in-service data, coarse/fine-grained distillation, self-distillation, and re-weighting for class imbalance.

Result: Experimental results on Tencent Mobile Payment datasets show effectiveness in both offline and online scenarios, improving pre-service risk assessment performance.

Conclusion: MGKD successfully bridges pre-service and in-service risk modeling, enabling transfer of behavioral patterns to enhance early risk prediction before service activation.

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes JCPGNN-M, a GNN-based algorithm with Lagrangian optimization for QoS-constrained multi-channel resource allocation, achieving eWMMSE performance with better speed, scalability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches lack theoretical convergence guarantees and often fail to satisfy QoS requirements in complex wireless networks with minimum data rate constraints.

Method: Extended WMMSE to multi-channel setting (eWMMSE), then developed GNN-based JCPGNN-M with Lagrangian primal-dual optimization framework to ensure constraint satisfaction and convergence.

Result: JCPGNN-M matches eWMMSE performance while offering significant improvements in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks with guaranteed QoS satisfaction.

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Motivation: On-device deep learning models face reverse engineering threats, and existing decompilers struggle with compilation optimizations and quantized compiled models.

Method: Leverages semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs combined with dynamic analysis for operator type recognition, attribute recovery, and model reconstruction.

Result: Successfully decompiles 96 DNN executables across 12 models, recovering non-quantized executables into nearly identical models and quantized ones with 72% average top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: NeuroDeX provides a more comprehensive and effective solution for DNN executable decompilation compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common
DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can
decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized
executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more

Motivation: Time series anomaly detection faces challenges with scarce labeled anomalies and complex temporal dependencies. Existing anomaly assumption methods suffer from patchy generation (scattered anomaly knowledge) and anomaly shift (synthetic anomalies either too similar to normal data or unrealistically different).

Method: Proposes CAPMix with three key components: 1) CutAddPaste mechanism for targeted anomaly injection, 2) label revision strategy for adaptive anomaly label refinement, 3) dual-space mixup within temporal convolutional network for smoother decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets (AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, ESA) show CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

Conclusion: CAPMix effectively addresses fundamental limitations of existing anomaly augmentation methods and demonstrates superior performance in time series anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

*Hongzong Li,Jiahao Ma,Zhanpeng Shi,Fanming Jin,Ye-Fan Hu,Jian-Dong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAME-AB is a novel cross-modality attention framework with Mixture-of-Experts backbone for antibody binding site prediction, integrating five biological modalities and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody binding site prediction methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on antigens, representing a dual limitation in both representation and prediction capabilities.

Method: Integrates five biological modalities (amino acid encodings, BLOSUM profiles, language model embeddings, structure-aware features, GCN-refined graphs) with adaptive modality fusion, Transformer encoder, MoE module, supervised contrastive learning, and stochastic weight averaging.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC across benchmark antibody-antigen datasets.

Conclusion: CAME-AB provides a robust multimodal framework for antibody binding site prediction, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

*Guanjie Cheng,Boyi Li,Peihan Wu,Feiyi Chen,Xinkui Zhao,Mengying Zhu,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyC-STG is a novel framework for IoT data credibility analysis that combines event-driven dynamic graph topology with causal reasoning to address limitations of traditional spatio-temporal graph models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spatio-temporal graph models fail in human-centric IoT environments due to static graph topologies that don't capture physical dynamics and confusion between spurious correlations and true causality, undermining data credibility.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG) with two key modules: event-driven dynamic graph that adapts topology in real-time based on physical state changes, and causal reasoning module that enforces temporal precedence to extract causally-aware representations.

Result: DyC-STG establishes new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving F1-Score up to 0.930. Two new real-world datasets were released to support research.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses critical limitations in IoT data credibility analysis by dynamically adapting to physical environment changes and distinguishing true causality from spurious correlations, making it suitable for real-time applications in human-centric environments.

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

TL;DR: HANNA is a neural network model that integrates physical laws as hard constraints to predict excess Gibbs energy for multi-component mixtures from molecular structures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures from molecular structures is a long-standing challenge in chemical engineering and chemistry for modeling thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures.

Method: Integration of physical laws as hard constraints within a flexible neural network, trained end-to-end on binary mixture data from Dortmund Data Bank, with novel surrogate solver for liquid-liquid equilibrium data and geometric projection for multi-component extrapolation.

Result: HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in both accuracy and scope.

Conclusion: The model provides thermodynamically consistent predictions and robust extrapolation to multi-component mixtures without additional parameters, with trained model and code openly available.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive

*Yu-Jui Huang,Hsin-Hua Shen,Yu-Chih Huang,Wan-Yi Lin,Shih-Chun Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives closed-form optimal parameters for WGANs beyond the linear-quadratic-Gaussian setting, extending to non-linear activations and non-Gaussian data in 1D, and shows linear generators can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGANs in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on optimal WGAN parameters was limited to linear networks and Gaussian data (LQG setting). There's a need for theoretically optimal parameter selection methods that work with non-linear activations and non-Gaussian distributions.

Method: Derived closed-form optimal parameters for 1D WGANs with non-linear activation functions and non-Gaussian data. Extended to high dimensions using sliced Wasserstein framework with joint distribution constraints instead of marginal constraints on projected data.

Result: Empirical studies show good convergence behavior with both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. The proposed sliced WGAN solution achieves same performance as r-PCA but with less computational resources.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretically grounded optimal parameter selection for WGANs beyond the restrictive LQG setting, enabling practical applications with non-linear networks and diverse data distributions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

### [355] [QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516)
*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Manuela Ferrario*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM is a multimodal foundation model for PPG and ECG signals that uses self-distillation and windowed sparse attention to improve signal quality assessment and clinical task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG and ECG signals in ICU/OR often have poor quality leading to false alarms and diagnostic errors. Existing methods lack generalizability, require extensive labeled data, and have poor cross-task transferability.

Method: Dual-track architecture processing paired high/low-quality signals with self-distillation strategy. Uses windowed sparse attention in Transformer-based model. Pre-trained on 21M+ waveforms (179,757 hours) with composite loss function combining distillation and reconstruction losses on power/phase spectra.

Result: Developed three models (9.6M to 319M parameters) showing efficacy in transfer learning for ventricular tachycardia false alarm detection, atrial fibrillation identification, and arterial blood pressure estimation from PPG/ECG.

Conclusion: QualityFM provides a general-purpose foundation model for physiological signal quality assessment that overcomes limitations of previous methods and demonstrates strong performance across multiple clinical applications.

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

*Francesco De Cristofaro,Cornelia Lex,Jia Hu,Arno Eichberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer model for lane change prediction shows poor cross-dataset performance (39.43% accuracy) but achieves high accuracy (86.71%) when trained on combined datasets from Germany and Hong Kong.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lane change intention prediction algorithms are typically trained and tested on single datasets, lacking validation of their generalizability across different populations and driving environments.

Method: Tested a transformer model designed for lane change intention prediction on two distinct datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and Hong Kong, evaluating both cross-dataset performance and combined training approach.

Result: The transformer's accuracy dropped significantly to 39.43% when tested on a different population than it was trained on, but achieved 86.71% accuracy when trained on both datasets simultaneously.

Conclusion: Lane change prediction models suffer from poor cross-dataset generalization, but training on diverse datasets from different regions significantly improves performance and generalizability.

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BF-PPO method using POMDP modeling and particle filters to learn optimal defender strategies for CAGE-2 cybersecurity benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art CARDIFF in both performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAGE-2 is a standard benchmark for cybersecurity defense strategies, but existing methods lack formal modeling and optimal strategy definition. The authors aim to create a formal POMDP model and develop an efficient learning method for optimal defense.

Method: Constructed formal POMDP model for CAGE-2, defined optimal defender strategy, and developed BF-PPO method based on PPO with particle filters to handle large state space complexity.

Result: BF-PPO outperformed CARDIFF (highest ranked method on CAGE-2 leaderboard) in both learned defender strategy quality and required training time.

Conclusion: The POMDP-based approach with particle filters provides an effective framework for learning optimal cybersecurity defense strategies, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

*John Tolladay,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Supervised VAE model for CTG signal classification achieves competitive fetal outcome prediction (AUROC 0.752-0.779) while partially encoding clinically meaningful features, though full interpretability remains challenging due to FHR signal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability limitations of current deep learning approaches for cardiotocography (CTG) signal classification by developing a supervised variational autoencoder that can both predict pregnancy outcomes and provide insights into clinically relevant features.

Method: Used OxMat CTG dataset to train VAE on 5-minute fetal heart rate segments labeled with postnatal outcomes. Model optimized for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction using Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation constraints to structure latent space. Evaluated with AUROC and MSE metrics.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 0.752 at segment level and 0.779 at CTG level. Relaxing total correlation constraints improved both reconstruction and classification. Baseline-related features were well represented and aligned with model scores, while variability metrics were less strongly encoded.

Conclusion: Supervised VAEs can provide competitive fetal outcome prediction while partially encoding clinically meaningful features, though the irregular, multi-timescale nature of FHR signals makes full interpretability challenging. Provides foundation for future interpretable generative models.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Christos Tachtatzis,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAN introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for network intrusion detection that treats augmented samples as negative views (representing malicious distributions) while using other benign samples as positive views, achieving superior performance in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised ML models require large labeled datasets, while anomaly detection methods suffer from high false positive rates. Self-supervised learning shows promise but current approaches use data augmentation for positive views and treat other samples as negative, which may not optimally capture malicious traffic patterns.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN) - a paradigm where augmented samples are treated as negative views (representing potentially malicious distributions) while other benign samples serve as positive views. This enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after pretraining on benign traffic.

Result: Experimental evaluation on Lycos2017 dataset shows CLAN surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in binary classification. When fine-tuned on limited labeled data, it achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.

Conclusion: CLAN provides an effective self-supervised learning framework for network intrusion detection that addresses limitations of existing approaches, demonstrating improved performance with lower false positive rates and better generalization to multi-class classification tasks.

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device real-time data distribution shifts challenge lightweight model generalization, and current data-intensive fine-tuning approaches are impractical for deployment.

Method: Uses a neural adapter in cloud to generate parameter editing matrix from real-time device data, creating prototype models that are dynamically refined with cross-layer knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and recommendation tasks across multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: Persona provides an efficient backpropagation-free framework for enhancing on-device model generalization against real-time data distribution shifts without post-deployment retraining.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why AI benefits in scientific discovery remain unevenly distributed, identifying that social and institutional barriers are more significant than technical obstacles alone.

Method: Analysis of current AI for science landscape through identifying four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, misaligned research priorities, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities.

Result: Identifies that cultural and organizational practices are root causes, requiring intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure.

Conclusion: AI for science should be reframed as a collective social project where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are prerequisites for technical progress.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

*Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu,Mikko Sillanpää*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for modeling dynamic nonlinear systems using structured decomposition and variance analysis, showing that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously and providing complexity bounds for learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit coupled static and dynamic distortions that are challenging for data-driven modeling, requiring a more foundational theoretical approach.

Method: Uses structured decomposition, variance analysis, directional lower bounds on interactions, behavioral indicators, memory finiteness index, and power-based conditions to establish measurable links to thermodynamics principles.

Result: Develops a Behavioral Uncertainty Principle showing static/dynamic trade-offs, proves systems resist complete deterministic decomposition, and provides theorems linking variance to learning complexity with practical benefits in generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach for modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems, explaining empirical benefits of structured residual learning and providing model-agnostic complexity metrics.

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAC-Bayesian analysis of GCNs for inductive node classification in dynamic graphs, deriving generalization bounds that account for data dependency and non-stationarity, with convergence conditions for both one-layer and two-layer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs are dynamic with evolving nodes and connections, but previous theoretical studies based on transductive learning fail to adequately model temporal evolution and structural dynamics.

Method: PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points. Derives generalization bounds incorporating data dependency and non-stationarity effects.

Result: Novel generalization bounds for one-layer GCNs with sufficient conditions for generalization gap convergence to zero as nodes increase. Analysis extended to two-layer GCNs revealing stronger topology assumptions needed for convergence.

Conclusion: Establishes theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments, providing insights into convergence requirements for different network depths.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

TL;DR: AI system (HAO) generates patient summaries for Molecular Tumor Boards using LLM agents, with TBFact framework evaluating summary quality without sharing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual patient summary creation for MTBs is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to information omissions, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) coordinates multi-agent clinical workflow using LLMs, with TBFact "model-as-a-judge" framework for evaluation.

Result: Captured 94% of high-importance information with 0.84 TBFact recall under strict entailment, enabling data-free local deployment.

Conclusion: HAO and TBFact provide reliable, scalable support for MTBs while maintaining data privacy through local evaluation framework.

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lightweight steering vectors trained with RL can match full fine-tuning performance while enabling interpretable analysis of how reasoning training reshapes language model computations through token-substitution biases and MLP/unembedding modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language model computations, as these remain poorly understood despite the effectiveness of such training approaches.

Method: Using lightweight steering vectors inserted into the residual stream and trained with reinforcement learning, combined with interpretability techniques like logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses on two models.

Result: Found that last-layer steering vectors act as token-substitution biases concentrated on first generated tokens (boosting tokens like "To" and "Step"), while penultimate-layer vectors modify MLP and unembedding to up-weight process words and structure symbols without changing attention patterns.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled framework for interpreting behavioral changes induced by reasoning training, showing how lightweight interventions can achieve fine-tuning performance while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review by tracing the evolution of generalization in GAD, formalizing problem settings, creating a systematic taxonomy, and providing an up-to-date comprehensive review of existing generalized GAD methods including transfer learning approaches and "one-for-all" foundation models.

Result: The review establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding generalization in GAD, categorizes existing methods through a fine-grained taxonomy, and identifies current state-of-the-art approaches in transfer learning and foundation models for graph anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The paper identifies current open challenges and suggests future research directions to inspire further work in this emerging field of generalized graph anomaly detection, emphasizing the need for more adaptable and transferable detection methods.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEAM is a novel deep learning framework that uses multi-view EEG signals to objectively predict empathy levels in young children, outperforming existing methods by capturing both cognitive and emotional dimensions through spatio-temporal feature extraction and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional empathy assessment methods rely on subjective self-reports or observer labeling, which are biased and fail to objectively capture empathy formation processes. EEG offers objectivity but current approaches only extract static patterns, missing temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposed Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM) with three components: 1) LaBraM-based encoder for spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) feature fusion module to integrate multi-view EEG signals, and 3) contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.

Result: BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics when validated on the CBCP dataset, demonstrating superior performance in predicting empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years.

Conclusion: BEAM provides an objective tool for empathy assessment in young children and offers preliminary insights for early interventions in children's prosocial development, addressing limitations of traditional subjective methods.

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

*Yung-Fu Chen,Sen Lin,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple algorithm that learns local routing policies from minimal graph data, using DNNs to solve all-pairs near-shortest path problems with domain knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient and scalable routing policies that generalize across geometric random graphs using minimal training data and deep learning techniques.

Method: Train deep neural networks with domain-informed input features (distance-to-destination and node stretch) to learn local routing policies from a single seed graph with few samples.

Result: Learned a policy matching Greedy Forwarding using only distance-to-destination, and developed GreedyTensile routing (using both features) that outperforms greedy forwarding with explainable, low-latency operation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully learns generalizable routing policies with minimal data, combining domain knowledge with DNNs to achieve efficient and scalable solutions for geometric random graphs.

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes gcGAIL model for efficient individual travel behavior modeling using group patterns, outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual travel behavior modeling is crucial for urban mobility regulation but faces data challenges - MDP solutions require extensive data with spatial-temporal coverage and situational diversity issues.

Method: Group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) that leverages shared behavioral patterns among passenger groups to improve modeling efficiency.

Result: gcGAIL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks (AIRL, GAIL, conditional GAIL) in accuracy, generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity.

Conclusion: gcGAIL enables effective prediction of individual behavior responses over time, providing basis for personalized incentives and sustainable behavior changes through better timing of incentive injections.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware is an RL-based routing framework for VANETs that addresses dynamic topologies and edge device constraints through action space pruning, graph cross-attention, and trajectory-aware prediction, achieving near-optimal performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET routing is challenging due to dynamic topologies, incomplete observations, and limited edge device resources. Existing RL approaches assume fixed graph structures and require retraining for changing conditions, making them unsuitable for constrained hardware deployment.

Method: TrajAware integrates three components: (1) action space pruning to reduce redundant neighbor options while preserving two-hop reachability, (2) graph cross-attention to map pruned neighbors to global graph context for generalization across network sizes, and (3) trajectory-aware prediction using historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations.

Result: Evaluated in SUMO simulator with real-world city maps using leave-one-city-out setup, TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Conclusion: TrajAware provides an effective RL-based solution for VANET routing that addresses the challenges of dynamic environments and resource constraints, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and practical deployability on edge devices.

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

### [371] [Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss: A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06694)
*Victor Toscano-Duran,Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz,Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Barycentric Neural Network (BNN) - a small shallow network using barycentric coordinates for exact representation of continuous piecewise linear functions, combined with new length-weighted persistent entropy loss for superior approximation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational costs of deep/overparameterized networks by creating small shallow networks that can exactly represent continuous piecewise linear functions and provide flexible approximations in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Uses fixed base points and barycentric coordinates to define BNN structure. Introduces length-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE) as stable topological feature. Optimizes base points directly rather than internal weights.

Result: Achieves superior and faster approximation performance compared to classical loss functions (MSE, RMSE, MAE, log-cosh). Enables exact representation of continuous piecewise linear functions with strict continuity.

Conclusion: BNN combined with LWPE loss provides flexible, interpretable function approximation with better performance and efficiency, particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments with limited base points and training epochs.

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

*Yuda Song,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL improves LLM reasoning but causes diversity collapse. Proposed outcome-based exploration with two algorithms maintains accuracy while preserving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning enhances LLM reasoning accuracy but systematically reduces generation diversity, which undermines real-world performance where diversity is critical for test-time scaling.

Method: Proposed outcome-based exploration with two algorithms: historical exploration (UCB-style bonuses for rare answers) and batch exploration (penalizes within-batch repetition). Also formalized through outcome-based bandits model.

Result: Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models show both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse.

Conclusion: Outcome-based exploration provides a practical path for RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

TL;DR: A probabilistic theory of intelligent agency showing that weighted logarithmic pooling enables strict welfare improvement for all agents, with applications to LLM alignment phenomena like the Luigi/Waluigi effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled mathematical framework for understanding how subagents coalesce into coherent higher-level entities, with applications to alignment in agentic AI systems.

Method: Represent agents as outcome distributions with epistemic utility via log score, define compositions through weighted logarithmic pooling, prove theoretical results about unanimity and welfare, and apply framework to analyze LLM alignment phenomena.

Result: Proved strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling but possible with three+ outcomes using logarithmic pooling. Formalized the Luigi/Waluigi phenomenon in LLMs and showed manifest-then-suppress strategy yields larger misalignment reduction than pure reinforcement.

Conclusion: The framework provides novel implications for AI alignment by mathematically formalizing how subagents can form coherent entities and demonstrating practical alignment strategies for LLMs.

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Motivation: Lack of consensus evaluation metrics for deep generative models in financial time series simulation, despite their importance for stress testing and decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: Employ nested optimal transport distance (time-causal variant of optimal transport) and develop a statistically consistent, parallelizable algorithm for its computation.

Result: Achieves substantial speedups over existing approaches for computing the evaluation metric.

Conclusion: Nested optimal transport provides a robust evaluation framework for financial time series generative models in decision-making applications like hedging and optimal stopping.

Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing,
scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based RL methods are sample efficient but suffer from slow inference times that prevent meeting robot control frequency requirements, creating a need for solutions that balance efficiency and real-time performance.

Method: Proposed a general framework for handling inference delays where slow controllers provide action sequences to feed control-hungry platforms without gaps, and developed RT-HCP algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time.

Result: RT-HCP demonstrated superior performance compared to other RL algorithms, successfully learning controllers directly on a high-frequency FURUTA pendulum platform while maintaining sample efficiency and meeting control frequency requirements.

Conclusion: RT-HCP provides an excellent solution to the inference time challenge in model-based RL for robotics, enabling direct learning on robots with high control frequency demands while maintaining sample efficiency.

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

Motivation: Existing wavelet-based graph neural networks use finite-order polynomial approximations that limit receptive fields and hinder long-range information propagation across graphs.

Method: Decomposes wavelet filters into complementary local and global components - local aggregation with efficient low-order polynomials, and long-range interactions through flexible spectral domain parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid design successfully unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework, overcoming limitations of previous polynomial approximations.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LVLMs to align with human values and specific tasks remains challenging despite pretraining progress

Method: Explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for reward-based optimization and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for direct policy alignment without explicit reward models

Result: Categorizes approaches, examines preference data sources and reward signals, and identifies challenges in scalability, efficiency, and safety

Conclusion: DRL and DPO techniques contribute significantly to developing robust, human-aligned multimodal models

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

Motivation: Graph Neural Networks suffer from oversquashing when handling long-range interactions due to bottlenecks in message propagation. Graph rewiring methods compromise inductive bias and cause information loss, while increasing channel capacity adds parameter complexity.

Method: An efficient model-agnostic framework that asynchronously updates node features by creating node batches based on centrality values in each layer. Only features of nodes in these batches get updated, processing information sequentially to avoid simultaneous compression.

Result: The framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds theoretically. Applied to six standard graph datasets and two long-range datasets, it achieved 5% improvement on REDDIT-BINARY and 4% improvement on Peptides-struct for graph classification.

Conclusion: Asynchronous message updates through centrality-based node batching effectively alleviate oversquashing in GNNs while maintaining performance on long-range tasks without compromising inductive bias or significantly increasing parameter complexity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

TL;DR: Physics-informed regularization for offline goal-conditioned RL using Eikonal PDE to improve value learning and generalization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline GCRL faces challenges with limited dataset coverage and long-horizon task generalization. Costly and unsafe data collection in domains like autonomous navigation motivates better methods.

Method: Propose Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss derived from Eikonal PDE to induce geometric inductive bias in value functions. Combines with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL) as Pi-HIQL.

Result: Significant improvements in performance and generalization, especially in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Physics-informed regularization grounded in continuous-time optimal control effectively improves offline GCRL by aligning value functions with cost-to-go structures.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

*Youbang Sun,Xiang Wang,Jie Fu,Chaochao Lu,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes safe-by-coevolution framework called R²AI that combines resistance to known threats with resilience to unforeseen risks through adversarial simulation and continual learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between rapidly growing AI capabilities and lagging safety progress, moving beyond brittle post-hoc alignment approaches to create intrinsically safe AI systems.

Method: R²AI framework integrates fast and slow safe models, uses a safety wind tunnel for adversarial simulation and verification, and employs continual feedback loops to coevolve safety and capability.

Result: The framework offers a scalable and proactive approach to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks.

Conclusion: Safe-by-coevolution provides a practical path forward for AI safety that can adapt to unforeseen risks as AI advances toward AGI and ASI, inspired by biological immunity principles.

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

*Bhavya Agrawalla,Michal Nauman,Khush Agarwal,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLOQ introduces iterative computation to TD-learning by parameterizing Q-functions using flow-matching velocity fields, enabling better capacity scaling and performance improvements in RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML uses dense intermediate supervision (like teacher forcing in language models) for better learning. This paper investigates applying iterative computation to temporal difference methods in RL, which typically use monolithic value function representations.

Method: FLOQ parameterizes Q-functions using a velocity field trained with flow-matching techniques. The velocity field is trained with TD-learning that bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field through multiple steps of numerical integration.

Result: Across challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, FLOQ improves performance by nearly 1.8x and scales capacity much better than standard TD-learning architectures.

Conclusion: Iterative computation through flow-matching shows significant potential for improving value learning in reinforcement learning, enabling better fine-grained control and scaling of Q-function capacity.

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

TL;DR: AxelSMOTE is a novel agent-based oversampling method that addresses class imbalance by modeling data instances as autonomous agents using Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, outperforming existing techniques while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional oversampling techniques for class imbalance have limitations: they treat features independently, lack similarity controls, limit diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively.

Method: AxelSMOTE implements four innovations: trait-based feature grouping to preserve correlations, similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism, Beta distribution blending for realistic interpolation, and controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.

Result: Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets show that AxelSMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The agent-based approach using Axelrod's cultural dissemination model provides an effective solution to class imbalance problems, overcoming the limitations of traditional oversampling techniques.

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why certain test samples are more vulnerable to targeted data poisoning attacks and introduces three predictive criteria for assessing attack difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose a serious threat to individual test instances in classification models, but it's unclear what factors make certain samples more susceptible than others.

Method: The authors introduce three predictive criteria: ergodic prediction accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and poison budget to assess attack difficulty across different test instances.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that these three metrics effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning attacks across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed criteria offer practitioners valuable insights for vulnerability assessment and better understanding of data poisoning attacks, helping identify which test samples are most at risk.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for

TL;DR: Proposes a robust OOD detection framework that integrates loss correction techniques with low-rank and sparse decomposition to handle noisy training labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise significantly degrades out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance, but principled solutions are lacking. Existing label noise-robust methods combined with OOD detection strategies are insufficient.

Method: Integrates loss correction techniques from noisy label learning with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection techniques, especially under severe noisy label settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the critical challenge of robust OOD detection under noisy training labels, providing superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

TL;DR: SEELE is a novel RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty by appending adaptive-length hints to optimize learning efficiency, outperforming previous methods by significant margins on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between problem difficulty and model capability - models fail on overly difficult problems and learn little from simple ones.

Method: SEELE appends adaptive-length hints to problems, using multi-round rollout sampling and item response theory modeling to determine optimal hint length that keeps difficulty in the high-efficiency learning region.

Result: Outperforms GRPO by +11.8 points, SFT by +10.5 points, and previous best supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic difficulty adjustment through adaptive hinting significantly improves exploration efficiency and reasoning capabilities in RLVR frameworks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel gradient descent approach for neutron reflectometry analysis using automatic differentiation to optimize reflectivity data, providing efficient optimization and maintaining physical intuition compared to machine learning surrogates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron reflectometry requires solving inverse modeling problems that are inefficient for large datasets or complex multilayer structures. Existing machine learning approaches lose physical intuition by replacing governing equations with neural networks.

Method: Proposes gradient descent optimization on the forward reflection model using automatic differentiation to compute exact gradients of the error function with respect to parameters of interest.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film and robust co-fitting performance for complex organic LED multilayer devices. Provides open-source differentiable reflectometry library.

Conclusion: The approach enables powerful modern optimization techniques for neutron reflectometry while maintaining physical intuition, with applications to various NR datasets through provided open-source tools.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-layer neural networks can learn arbitrary finite group operations and exhibit grokking behavior by finding low-rank tensor implementations through group representation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks can learn complex algebraic operations like group word operations and explain the grokking phenomenon observed during this learning process.

Method: Reframe the problem as learning a 3-tensor, show it's typically low-rank, decompose along self-conjugate group representations, and analyze a surrogate model to understand how networks find low-rank implementations.

Result: Networks can learn arbitrary finite group operations by finding low-rank tensor approximations, effectively implementing efficient matrix multiplication similar to Strassen's algorithm.

Conclusion: The work provides insight into how neural networks learn algebraic structures through low-rank tensor decompositions and explains the grokking mechanism under gradient descent optimization.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer models hallucinate when input uncertainty increases, activating input-insensitive semantic features that lead to coherent but incorrect outputs, with hallucinations predictable from internal concept patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI systems become more competent and democratized, understanding their failure modes like hallucinations is crucial for trust and adoption in high-stakes applications.

Method: Used sparse autoencoders to capture concept representations in pre-trained transformer models under experimentally controlled input uncertainty scenarios, analyzing intermediate activations and concept patterns.

Result: Found that semantic concepts grow with unstructured inputs, transformers activate coherent but input-insensitive features under uncertainty, and hallucinations can be reliably predicted from internal concept patterns in activations.

Conclusion: These insights have immediate implications for AI alignment, safety, adversarial attack surfaces, and automatic quantification of hallucination risk in transformer models.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

TL;DR: Integrating LLM knowledge with RL in cybersecurity operations improves initial performance and reduces negative exploratory actions, achieving 2x higher rewards and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents in cybersecurity typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute undesirable actions to learn consequences, which can be inefficient and risky.

Method: Integrate external knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on cybersecurity data to guide RL agent's initial training and decision-making.

Result: LLM-guided agent achieves over 2x higher rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately 4,500 episodes faster than baseline.

Conclusion: Using LLM knowledge to guide RL training in cybersecurity operations significantly improves performance and efficiency while reducing the need for harmful exploratory actions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous
decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through
direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber
Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute
undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate
external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on
cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed
decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline
performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative
outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity
environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher
rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately

TL;DR: NETE is a novel backdoor sample detection method that uses perturbation discrepancy consistency evaluation, requiring only an off-the-shelf pre-trained model and automated perturbation generation, outperforming existing zero-shot black-box detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor detection methods require access to poisoned models, extra clean samples, or significant computational resources, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes NETE method based on perturbation discrepancy consistency evaluation. Uses curvature to measure discrepancy in log probabilities between perturbed and original samples, leveraging the phenomenon that backdoor samples show smaller perturbation discrepancy changes than clean samples.

Result: Experiments on four typical backdoor attacks and five types of large language model backdoor attacks demonstrate that NETE outperforms existing zero-shot black-box detection methods.

Conclusion: NETE provides an effective and practical solution for backdoor sample detection that works in both pre-training and post-training phases with minimal requirements, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The use of unvetted third-party and internet data renders pre-trained models
susceptible to backdoor attacks. Detecting backdoor samples is critical to
prevent backdoor activation during inference or injection during training.
However, existing detection methods often require the defender to have access
to the poisoned models, extra clean samples, or significant computational
resources to detect backdoor samples, limiting their practicality. To address
this limitation, we propose a backdoor sample detection method based on
perturbatio\textbf{N} discr\textbf{E}pancy consis\textbf{T}ency
\textbf{E}valuation (\NETE). This is a novel detection method that can be used
both pre-training and post-training phases. In the detection process, it only
requires an off-the-shelf pre-trained model to compute the log probability of
samples and an automated function based on a mask-filling strategy to generate
perturbations. Our method is based on the interesting phenomenon that the
change in perturbation discrepancy for backdoor samples is smaller than that
for clean samples. Based on this phenomenon, we use curvature to measure the
discrepancy in log probabilities between different perturbed samples and input
samples, thereby evaluating the consistency of the perturbation discrepancy to
determine whether the input sample is a backdoor sample. Experiments conducted
on four typical backdoor attacks and five types of large language model
backdoor attacks demonstrate that our detection strategy outperforms existing
zero-shot black-box detection methods.

Method: Reframes proof generation as Tree Evaluation problem and leverages space-efficient tree-evaluation algorithms to create a streaming prover that avoids materializing the full execution trace.

Result: Achieves O(sqrt(T)) memory usage (with O(log T) lower-order terms) while maintaining proof size, verifier time, and security guarantees of the underlying system.

Conclusion: Enables shift from server-bound proving to on-device proving, opening applications in decentralized systems, on-device machine learning, and privacy-preserving technologies.

Abstract: Modern zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, essential for privacy and
verifiable computation, suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prover
typically uses memory that scales linearly with the computation's trace length
T, making them impractical for resource-constrained devices and prohibitively
expensive for large-scale tasks. This paper overcomes this barrier by
constructing, to our knowledge, the first sublinear-space ZKP prover. Our core
contribution is an equivalence that reframes proof generation as an instance of
the classic Tree Evaluation problem. Leveraging a recent space-efficient
tree-evaluation algorithm, we design a streaming prover that assembles the
proof without ever materializing the full execution trace. The approach reduces
prover memory from linear in T to O(sqrt(T)) (up to O(log T) lower-order terms)
while preserving proof size, verifier time, and the transcript/security
guarantees of the underlying system. This enables a shift from specialized,
server-bound proving to on-device proving, opening applications in
decentralized systems, on-device machine learning, and privacy-preserving
technologies.

workflow was used to create the dataset, which extracts structured data, uses
large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a
specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models
evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning
generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance

*Christos Anagnostopoulos,Ioulia Kapsali,Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel open-source simulation framework for testing autonomous vehicle security by generating multi-domain adversarial attacks targeting both perception (LiDAR) and communication (V2X, GPS) layers with high-fidelity modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on their complex perception and communication systems, but existing simulation frameworks lack comprehensive support for modeling multi-domain attack scenarios.

Method: Developed an integrated simulation framework with high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and V2X networking, synchronized through a unified core using a single configuration file. Supports ROS 2 integration for compatibility with AV software stacks.

Result: The framework effectively generates diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR data and communication-level threats like V2X message manipulation and GPS spoofing, causing significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art 3D object detectors under realistic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution for testing AV robustness against multi-domain adversarial attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating security vulnerabilities through realistic simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on complex perception and communication
systems, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
safety. While simulation offers a scalable and safe environment for robustness
testing, existing frameworks typically lack comprehensive supportfor modeling
multi-domain adversarial scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, open-source
integrated simulation framework designed to generate adversarial attacks
targeting both perception and communication layers of AVs. The framework
provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and
V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that
synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our
implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data,
along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS
spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with
third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by
evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art
3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under
realistic conditions.

*Waris Gill,Natalie Isak,Matthew Dressman*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BinaryShield is a privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of prompt injection attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries without violating privacy regulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM services face security blind spots where prompt injection attacks detected in one service cannot be shared with others due to privacy regulations, allowing threats to persist undetected across multiple services.

Method: Transforms suspicious prompts through PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response to generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while ensuring privacy.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 0.94 (vs SimHash's 0.77), 64x storage reduction, and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.

Conclusion: BinaryShield effectively enables cross-service threat intelligence sharing while maintaining privacy compliance and significantly improving detection performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,
while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared
to dense embeddings.

*Ismail Hossain,Sai Puppala,Sajedul Talukder,Md Jahangir Alam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving AI framework for real-time scam detection that combines instruction-tuned AI with federated learning to proactively disrupt scam conversations while maintaining engagement and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scams using real-time social engineering remain persistent threats, and existing defenses are largely reactive with limited protection during active interactions.

Method: AI-in-the-loop framework with instruction-tuned AI, safety-aware utility function balancing engagement and harm minimization, and federated learning for continual model updates without raw data sharing.

Result: System produces fluent responses (perplexity 22.3, engagement ≈0.80), human studies confirm gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness. Federated models sustain 30 rounds with high engagement (≈0.80), strong relevance (≈0.74), and low PII leakage (≤0.0085).

Conclusion: First framework unifying real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm, achieving robust privacy without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing,
impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat
across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering
limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,
AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam
conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial
intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with
harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model
updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system
produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement
$\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,
safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models
trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement
($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage
($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain
stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing
performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,
MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce
the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the
model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer
and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of
higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify
real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety
moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.

*Shei Pern Chua,Thai Zhen Leng,Teh Kai Jun,Xiao Li,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIAL framework uses ethical dilemmas based on trolley problems to jailbreak LLMs by exploiting their advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving high success rates and revealing fundamental safety limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, traditional single-step jailbreak attacks may be insufficient, and multi-turn strategies that dynamically adapt to context remain underexplored, creating new security risks.

Method: TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic) framework embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem to leverage LLMs' ethical reasoning and bypass their safeguards.

Result: TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and closed-source models, showing that current safety alignment may inadvertently allow covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited.

Conclusion: The findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety where advanced reasoning abilities may create new vulnerabilities, raising an urgent need to reevaluate safety alignment oversight strategies as current safeguards may be insufficient against context-aware adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in
reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While
traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn
jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In
this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack
Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their
safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on
the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards
both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental
limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the
nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security
vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating
safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove
insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.

*Abdul Rehman,Are Dæhlen,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-wei Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving framework for eye-tracking data in learning environments that prevents identity backtracking while maintaining diagnostic utility through real-time anonymization, ethical design, and federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye-tracking technology provides valuable insights for neurodevelopmental disorders but poses significant privacy risks by capturing sensitive information that can be traced back to individuals, requiring a balance between pedagogical benefits and privacy protection.

Method: Two-stage framework: Phase 1 demonstrates backtracking risks across four scenarios, Phase 2 implements privacy preservation through real-time data anonymization, ethical design principles, GDPR compliance, and federated learning with secure identity management using dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls.

Result: Phase 1 achieved 99.3% accuracy for disorder diagnosis prediction, 63% accuracy for student ID prediction, and 99.7% accuracy for randomized data prediction. Phase 2 successfully prevented backtracking with 99.40% overall accuracy while maintaining a secure identity management system.

Conclusion: The proposed human-centered framework effectively balances privacy protection and diagnostic utility in eye-tracking applications, demonstrating that identity backtracking can be prevented while preserving the educational benefits of AI-powered eye tracking through comprehensive privacy-preserving techniques.

Abstract: Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders
and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant
risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and
increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper
proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking
while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in
interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization,
ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be
integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential
for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious
game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving
framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling
diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting
disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs
based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized
data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we
present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated
Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity
management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the
first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63%
accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully
identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we
effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management
system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an
overall accuracy of 99.40%.

*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ThreatGPT is an AI assistant that helps non-experts analyze security threats in public safety systems using popular cybersecurity frameworks through simple descriptions and few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As smart cities and communities grow more complex, security threats pose increasing risks to public safety systems that affect people's lives directly, requiring accessible threat analysis tools for non-cybersecurity experts.

Method: Uses few-shot learning to generate smart threat models based on user descriptions of system components, allowing analysis through frameworks like STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, and CISA with a simple interface.

Result: Creates an AI partner that identifies potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and prevention measures, adapting to various public safety contexts from city infrastructure to local health services.

Conclusion: ThreatGPT combines AI capabilities with human judgment to empower engineers, safety officers, and policymakers to understand and address security threats faster and more confidently in public safety systems.

Abstract: As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe,
such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public
transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater
risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's
lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers,
safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public
safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows
users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,
such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the
click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by
using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or
CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information,
but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the
AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can
highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can
be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local
health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT
brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is
designed not just to analyze threats, but to empower people to understand and
act on them, faster, smarter, and with more confidence.

*Haywood Gelman,John D. Hastings,David Kenley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents an LLM-based approach using Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically generate synthetic syslog data with insider threat indicators, achieving better detection performance than GPT-4o across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current insider threat research relies on static, limited-access datasets that restrict development of adaptive detection models, creating a need for dynamic synthetic data generation.

Method: Uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 to synthesize realistic syslog messages with 1% insider threat indicators, then evaluates detection performance of both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o using precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC metrics.

Result: Claude Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong promise for both synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection, with Claude Sonnet 3.7 demonstrating superior performance over GPT-4o.

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of
identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is
dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,
and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been
generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which
restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a
novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)
Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which
contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world
data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs
were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with
their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,
recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across
nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving
detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in
synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

*Youjia Zheng,Mohammad Zandsalimy,Shanu Sushmita*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Camouflaged jailbreaking embeds malicious intent in benign language to bypass LLM safety mechanisms, revealing significant vulnerabilities that current keyword-based defenses cannot detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial prompting that exploits contextual ambiguity, posing challenges to existing safety mechanisms that rely on overt detection methods.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset of 500 curated prompts (400 harmful, 100 benign) and developed a multi-faceted evaluation framework measuring harmfulness across 7 dimensions including Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, and Compliance Score.

Result: LLMs show high safety with benign inputs but significant performance and safety decline when faced with camouflaged jailbreak attempts, revealing a stark vulnerability contrast.

Conclusion: The study highlights pervasive LLM vulnerabilities to subtle attacks and underscores the urgent need for more nuanced, adaptive security strategies for robust real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated
form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method
embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing
safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit
contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant
challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction
and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive
characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection
methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts,
containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed
to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a
multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven
dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards,
Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score.
Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate
high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant
decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak
attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting
the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the
responsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving LLM offloading framework for 6G vehicular networks using federated learning and differential privacy, achieving 75% accuracy with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offloading LLM computations in 6G vehicular networks poses significant privacy risks by potentially exposing sensitive user data, requiring privacy-preserving solutions.

Method: Hybrid approach combining federated learning and differential privacy with privacy-aware task partitioning algorithm and secure communication protocol.

Result: Achieves 75% global accuracy (only 2-3% reduction vs non-private methods) with DP guarantees (ε=0.8), 2.1MB communication overhead per round, and 90% computation time.

Conclusion: The framework effectively protects user privacy while maintaining LLM performance and efficiency in resource-constrained vehicular environments.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks
promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems.
However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses
significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper
presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated
vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning
(FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while
maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task
partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge
computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We
also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and
aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared
to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an
optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable
communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation
comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for
resource-constrained vehicular environments.

*Joshua Ward,Yuxuan Yang,Chi-Hua Wang,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: No single membership inference attack (MIA) method dominates across different model architectures and datasets. Ensemble MIAs combining multiple individual attacks provide more robust and regret-minimizing strategies for synthetic data privacy auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks are used to audit privacy in synthetic tabular data, but adversaries face uncertainty in choosing the best method without prior knowledge of which will perform best in different scenarios.

Method: Conducted the largest synthetic data privacy benchmark to date, analyzing various MIA methods across different model architectures and dataset domains. Proposed ensemble MIAs that combine multiple individual attacks.

Result: Found that no single MIA method constitutes a strictly dominant strategy across different scenarios. Ensemble MIAs built on individual attacks offered more robust and regret-minimizing strategies than individual attacks alone.

Conclusion: Ensemble approaches provide superior performance for membership inference attacks on synthetic data, offering more reliable privacy auditing across diverse threat scenarios compared to relying on any single attack method.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a principled framework
for auditing the privacy of synthetic data generated by tabular generative
models, where many diverse methods have been proposed that each exploit
different privacy leakage signals. However, in realistic threat scenarios, an
adversary must choose a single method without a priori guarantee that it will
be the empirically highest performing option. We study this challenge as a
decision theoretic problem under uncertainty and conduct the largest synthetic
data privacy benchmark to date. Here, we find that no MIA constitutes a
strictly dominant strategy across a wide variety of model architectures and
dataset domains under our threat model. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ensemble MIAs and show that unsupervised ensembles built on individual attacks
offer empirically more robust, regret-minimizing strategies than individual
attacks.

*Xng Ai,Shudan Lin,Zecheng Li,Kai Zhou,Bixin Li,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SEASONED is a framework for detecting Adversarial Exploiter Contracts in DeFi by analyzing semantic dependencies in smart contract bytecode and providing self-explanatory detection results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi attacks cause significant losses through AECs that exploit smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing detection methods lack interpretability and struggle with semantic dependencies, creating knowledge gaps in AEC analysis.

Method: Extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to build semantic relation graphs (SRG), then uses a self-counterfactual explainable detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations highlighting attack logic.

Result: Demonstrates outstanding detection performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency. Includes release of a new dataset of 359 AECs for further research.

Conclusion: SEASONED effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by providing explainable detection of AECs with strong performance across multiple metrics, advancing proactive threat identification in DeFi.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks have resulted in significant losses,
often orchestrated through Adversarial Exploiter Contracts (AECs) that exploit
vulnerabilities in victim smart contracts. To proactively identify such
threats, this paper targets the explainable detection of AECs.
  Existing detection methods struggle to capture semantic dependencies and lack
interpretability, limiting their effectiveness and leaving critical knowledge
gaps in AEC analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce SEASONED, an
effective, self-explanatory, and robust framework for AEC detection.
  SEASONED extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to construct a
semantic relation graph (SRG), and employs a self-counterfactual explainable
detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations that highlight the
core attack logic. SCFED further enhances robustness, generalizability, and
data efficiency by extracting representative information from these
explanations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of SEASONED, which showcases outstanding detection
performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency learning
ability. To support further research, we also release a new dataset of 359
AECs.

*Hanna Foerster,Ilia Shumailov,Yiren Zhao,Harsh Chaudhari,Jamie Hayes,Robert Mullins,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Decomposed reasoning poison attacks modify only the reasoning path while keeping prompts and final answers clean, but LLMs show emergent backdoor robustness through reasoning recovery capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore more stealthy poisoning attacks by leveraging LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning and decomposing triggers across multiple harmless components.

Method: Introduces decomposed reasoning poison where attackers modify only the intermediate reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers unchanged, and split triggers across multiple components.

Result: While injection is possible, reliably activating these poisons to change final answers is surprisingly difficult due to models' ability to recover from backdoors activated during reasoning.

Conclusion: Advanced LLMs exhibit emergent backdoor robustness originating from their reasoning capabilities and architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.

Abstract: Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models
(LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More
recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include
the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing
problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we
introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only
the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the
trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.
  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons,
reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is
surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often
recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes.
Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is
originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as
from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer
generation.

*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A tell-tale watermarking system that traces transformation chains in synthetic media by using interpretable watermarks that evolve with media transformations, enabling forensic analysis of editing history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic media and sophisticated editing tools has created an infodemic that erodes public trust, making it crucial to develop forensic methods to reconstruct the chain of events and detect criminal intent in manipulated digital imagery.

Method: Developed a tell-tale watermarking system with watermarks tailored to different transformation classes (semantic edits, photometric adjustments, geometric projections) that evolve synchronously with carrier media, leaving interpretable traces for explanatory reasoning across composite transformations.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrated the validity of the tell-tale watermarking approach with respect to fidelity (quality preservation), synchronicity (consistent evolution with media), and traceability (ability to reconstruct transformation chains).

Conclusion: The proposed tell-tale watermarking system provides an effective forensic solution for tracing the generation chain of synthetic media, offering interpretable evidence of transformations that can help combat misinformation and restore trust in digital content.

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when
subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer
the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of
composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of
tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and
traceability.

*Yu Liu,Yuchong Xie,Mingyu Luo,Zesen Liu,Zhixiang Zhang,Kaikai Zhang,Zongjie Li,Ping Chen,Shuai Wang,Dongdong She*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLM-based agentic systems are vulnerable to security attacks through Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP) manipulation, enabling remote code execution and denial of service attacks on major systems like Cursor and Claude Code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIP security has been largely overlooked despite being a critical component that defines tool interaction protocols and ensures security in LLM-based agentic systems.

Method: Developed a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW) to demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking through manipulated tool invocations.

Result: Revealed that major LLM-based systems are vulnerable to attacks including RCE and DoS, successfully demonstrating tool behavior hijacking.

Conclusion: Proposed defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems to address these critical vulnerabilities.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user
queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across
domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical
component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines
tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and
correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been
largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks,
revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are
vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service
(DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate
external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also
propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic
systems.

### [409] [Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831)
*Ishaan Verma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks through hidden HTML elements like meta tags and aria-labels, which can manipulate model outputs without visible webpage changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how non-visible HTML elements can be exploited for adversarial prompt injections in web-based LLM systems, addressing a critical security vulnerability.

Method: Created a dataset of 280 web pages (half clean, half adversarial) with HTML-based injection strategies. Evaluated Llama 4 Scout and Gemma 9B IT models using browser automation to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, assessing with ROUGE-L, SBERT cosine similarity, and manual annotations.

Result: 29% of injected samples affected Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed 15% success rate. Hidden adversarial content can significantly manipulate LLM outputs.

Conclusion: HTML-based prompt injection represents a critical vulnerability in LLM web pipelines, requiring urgent mitigation strategies and providing a reproducible framework for future security evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based
systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection
attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible
HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited
to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a
webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly
divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse
HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation
pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking
real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art
open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their
ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic
(SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the
impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of
injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries,
while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These
results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven
web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model
outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating
HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust
mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.

### [410] [Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883)
*Andrew Yeo,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates security vulnerabilities in 8 commercial LLMs against prompt injection attacks, finding exploitable weaknesses across all models despite Claude 3 showing relatively better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become widely adopted across industries, their security vulnerabilities - particularly prompt injection and jailbreak attacks - pose substantial risks that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Conducted experiments on eight commercial LLMs without supplementary sanitization, testing four attack categories: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage.

Result: All models showed exploitable weaknesses, with Claude 3 demonstrating relatively greater robustness compared to others. The findings emphasize the insufficiency of built-in safeguards alone.

Conclusion: Additional security measures such as input normalization are necessary to achieve reliable protection against prompt injection attacks in commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with
industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage.
These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like
responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including
consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also
introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt
injection and jailbreak attacks.
  To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external
prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial
models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying
solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses
and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of
attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection,
image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that
Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical
findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain
necessary to achieve reliable protection.

### [411] [DCMI: A Differential Calibration Membership Inference Attack Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06026)
*Xinyu Gao,Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DCMI is a differential calibration membership inference attack that effectively targets RAG systems by isolating member document contributions through query perturbation, achieving 97.42% AUC and outperforming baselines by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems reduce hallucinations but introduce vulnerabilities to membership inference attacks, especially with sensitive data. Existing attacks ignore interference from non-member documents, limiting effectiveness.

Method: DCMI leverages sensitivity gap between member and non-member documents under query perturbation. It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate member document contributions while minimizing non-member interference.

Result: DCMI achieves 97.42% AUC and 94.35% accuracy against Flan-T5 RAG system, exceeding MBA baseline by over 40%. Maintains 10-20% advantage on real-world platforms like Dify and MaxKB.

Conclusion: RAG systems have significant privacy risks. DCMI demonstrates effective membership inference attacks, highlighting need for stronger protection mechanisms against data leakage in evolving RAG systems.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations
by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive
data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model
responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG
outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a
differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of
non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity
gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation.
It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of
member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from
non-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed
assumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example,
achieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5,
exceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG
platforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the
baseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and
emphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We appeal to the
community's consideration of deeper investigations, like ours, against the data
leakage risks in rapidly evolving RAG systems. Our code is available at

### [412] [PLRV-O: Advancing Differentially Private Deep Learning via Privacy Loss Random Variable Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06264)
*Qin Yang,Nicholas Stout,Meisam Mohammady,Han Wang,Ayesha Samreen,Christopher J Quinn,Yan Yan,Ashish Kundu,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PLRV-O introduces a parameterized noise distribution framework for DP-SGD that enables independent control of privacy loss and utility degradation, achieving significant accuracy improvements over conventional Gaussian noise under strict privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DP-SGD mechanisms like Gaussian and Laplacian noise have only one degree of freedom, tying noise magnitude directly to both privacy loss and utility degradation. This prevents independent control and becomes problematic when task parameters (composition rounds, batch size) vary, causing disproportionate accuracy impacts from small noise parameter changes.

Method: PLRV-O defines a broad search space of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions where privacy loss moments are tightly characterized but can be optimized more independently with respect to utility loss. This enables systematic noise adaptation to task-specific requirements including model size, training duration, batch sampling strategies, and clipping thresholds.

Result: Substantial utility improvements under strict privacy constraints: CIFAR-10 - ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at ε≈0.5 (vs 83.93% with Gaussian); SST-2 - RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy at ε≈0.2 (vs 50.25% with Gaussian).

Conclusion: PLRV-O successfully addresses the limitations of conventional DP-SGD noise mechanisms by providing a flexible framework that enables better privacy-utility trade-offs through parameterized noise distributions optimized for specific task requirements.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard
method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian
mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as
Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This
single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy
loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two
factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition
rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce
task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in
noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this
limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space
of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are
tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to
utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to
task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration,
(iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both
training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O
substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a
fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared
to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy
at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.

### [413] [Signal-Based Malware Classification Using 1D CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06548)
*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Ivan Andonovic,Christos Tachtatzis,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes 1D signal conversion instead of 2D images for malware classification, avoiding information loss and achieving state-of-the-art performance with a custom ResNet-based 1D CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D image conversion of malware binaries causes significant information loss due to quantization noise and artificial 2D dependencies, limiting classification performance.

Method: Converts malware files into 1D signals stored in floating-point format to avoid quantization noise, and develops a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network based on ResNet architecture with squeeze-and-excitation layers.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on MalNet dataset with F1 scores of 0.874 (binary), 0.503 (type), and 0.507 (family) classification.

Conclusion: 1D signal modality provides superior performance over 2D image approaches, paving the way for future malware classification models to operate on this improved signal representation.

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

*Shuai Yuan,Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Guangdong Bai,Wang Kailong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SEP is a novel attack method that injects imperceptible perturbations into LLM embedding layers to bypass safety alignment and induce harmful behaviors, achieving 96.43% success rate while evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public LLM platforms fail to detect subtle manipulations in embedding layers, creating security vulnerabilities that can be exploited during deployment phase without modifying model weights or input text.

Method: Search based Embedding Poisoning (SEP) framework that introduces optimized perturbations into high-risk token embeddings by identifying a narrow perturbation window through predictable linear response transitions.

Result: SEP achieves 96.43% average attack success rate across six aligned LLMs while preserving benign task performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms.

Conclusion: The research reveals critical deployment security oversights and emphasizes the urgent need for embedding-level integrity checks in LLM defense strategies.

Abstract: The widespread distribution of Large Language Models (LLMs) through public
platforms like Hugging Face introduces significant security challenges. While
these platforms perform basic security scans, they often fail to detect subtle
manipulations within the embedding layer. This work identifies a novel class of
deployment phase attacks that exploit this vulnerability by injecting
imperceptible perturbations directly into the embedding layer outputs without
modifying model weights or input text. These perturbations, though
statistically benign, systematically bypass safety alignment mechanisms and
induce harmful behaviors during inference. We propose Search based Embedding
Poisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully
optimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP
leverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to
harmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window
that evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP
achieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task
performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal
a critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for
embedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AttestLLM is a novel hardware-software co-designed framework for efficiently verifying the legitimacy of on-device LLMs through watermarking and TEE optimization, ensuring only authorized models run on target platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As on-device LLMs become widespread for privacy and responsiveness, existing attestation techniques are inadequate for billion-parameter models, requiring efficient verification against emerging threats.

Method: Leverages algorithm/software/hardware co-design to embed watermarking signatures into LLM activation distributions and optimizes attestation protocol within Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

Result: Extensive evaluations on Llama, Qwen, and Phi models demonstrate reliable attestation with high fidelity and efficiency, while resisting model replacement and forgery attacks.

Conclusion: AttestLLM provides the first efficient framework for hardware-level IP protection of on-device LLMs, ensuring model legitimacy without compromising inference performance.

Abstract: As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to
reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness,
verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical.
Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large
Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient
while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present
AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the
hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that
only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an
algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking
signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also
optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference
throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen,
and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation
reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model
legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery
attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Security analysis reveals major vulnerabilities in ML model sharing frameworks and hubs, with 6 zero-day vulnerabilities found that enable arbitrary code execution, debunking the myth that security is solved by file formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate security risks in ML model sharing frameworks and hubs, assess security mechanisms, and understand user perceptions of security in model sharing ecosystems.

Method: Comprehensive security evaluation of frameworks and hubs, analysis of security-oriented mechanisms, vulnerability discovery, and user perception surveys.

Result: Most frameworks address security risks partially by shifting responsibility to users, 6 zero-day vulnerabilities found enabling arbitrary code execution, security narratives mislead users into trusting inadequate security settings.

Conclusion: Current security measures in ML model sharing are insufficient, requiring stronger security practices and ecosystem improvements to address the identified vulnerabilities and user misconceptions.

Abstract: The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine
Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools
expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains
limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more
security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we
evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether
security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users
perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation
shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best,
often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis
of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing
uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through
this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is
largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used
for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security
narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy,
despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and
suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.

TL;DR: IMIA is a novel membership inference attack that uses imitative training to create target-informed models, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 5% of computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks require training hundreds of shadow models, which is computationally expensive and inefficient.

Method: Uses imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while requiring less than 5% of computational cost compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: IMIA provides a highly efficient and effective alternative to traditional membership inference attacks with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a target machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were part of the training set. State-of-the-art MIAs rely on
training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model,
leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative
training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed
imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for
inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially
outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less
than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: Traditional AI approaches in cybersecurity suffer from inadequate conceptual grounding, limited instructibility, and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives, necessitating more robust and adaptive solutions.

Method: Systematic analysis of 127 publications (2019-2025) using a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate Neuro-Symbolic AI systems across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations.

Result: Multi-agent NeSy architectures show advantages, with causal reasoning integration being the most transformative advancement. Systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation with significant cost reductions, but face implementation challenges including standardization gaps and computational complexity.

Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI has dual-use implications that alter threat dynamics, requiring urgent community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices to ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.

Abstract: Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit
fundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to
non-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding
analyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives.
Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize
cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this
emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity
challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning,
enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous
offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we
systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning
2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A)
framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber
offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our
analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies
critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps,
computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that
constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most
transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based
approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous
systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while
achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide
insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for
community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development
practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives
while maintaining societal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficient long-range dependency modeling in vision-based robot locomotion, particularly handling long sequences of visual and proprioceptive data while reducing computational complexity and improving generalization.

Method: Embeds proprioceptive states with MLP, patchifies depth images with lightweight CNN, uses stacked Mamba layers for near-linear-time selective scanning fusion, and trains with PPO under terrain/appearance randomization with obstacle-density curriculum.

Result: Achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions compared to SOTA baselines, demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and converges faster with same compute budget.

Conclusion: LocoMamba provides an efficient and effective framework for vision-driven locomotion that handles long-range dependencies while being computationally efficient and robust to various environmental challenges.

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in robotic manipulation and limitations of existing 2D trajectory-based methods that suffer from 3D spatial ambiguity problems.

Method: Combines 3D occupancy map reconstruction from input images with optimized 3D end-effector trajectory planning, then uses latent editing and a trajectory-to-video diffusion model to generate pick-and-place videos.

Result: Superior visual quality compared to existing methods, generates videos with plausible 3D trajectories while significantly reducing human intervention requirements.

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D provides an effective framework for generating realistic 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos, addressing data scarcity and 3D spatial ambiguity challenges in the field.

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations for autonomous vehicles are limited to synthetic or manually driving datasets without ground truth knowledge, lacking insight into how current perception/planning algorithms would perform in evaluated cases.

Conclusion: Discusses findings on the potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles, addressing real-world failure scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: Plantbot is a hybrid system connecting a living plant with a mobile robot using LLM modules that communicate via natural language to translate plant states into robotic actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a new model of artificial life by combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated communication, enabling seamless interaction across biological and artificial domains.

Method: Uses a network of asynchronous LLM modules (sensing, vision, dialogue, action) that communicate via natural language as a universal protocol to translate multimodal data (soil moisture, temperature, visual context) into coordinated system behaviors.

Result: Plantbot functions as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of autonomous responses to environmental conditions by transforming plant states into robotic actions.

Conclusion: This approach suggests possibilities for decentralized LLM module coordination enabling novel interactions between biological and artificial systems, representing a new model of artificial life.

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous

simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a new agent framework with dual reflection modules for plan and code generation to address challenges in long-horizon visual imitation learning, introducing LongVILBench benchmark with 300 complex demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects in visual imitation learning.

Method: A framework with two dedicated reflection modules: plan generation module produces initial action sequence, verified by plan reflection module for temporal coherence and spatial alignment; code generation module translates plan into executable code, verified by code reflection module for correctness and consistency.

Result: Experimental results show existing methods perform poorly on the new LongVILBench benchmark, while the proposed framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning tasks.

Conclusion: The dual reflection modules enable effective error detection and correction in both plan and code generation, improving performance on tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies in long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for autonomous lunar regolith excavation that uses high-fidelity simulation with procedural terrain and tool generation, enabling robots to adaptively control stiffness and damping for versatile tool-aware behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous regolith excavation is essential for in-situ resource utilization in space missions, but is hindered by complex granular media dynamics and the need for robots to use diverse tools effectively.

Method: Model-based reinforcement learning agent trained in parallelized simulation with high-fidelity particle physics, procedural generation of lunar terrains and tool geometries, and operational space control for dynamic stiffness/damping modulation.

Result: Training with procedural tool distribution enables generalization and sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Visual feedback augmentation significantly improves task success rates.

Conclusion: The framework provides a validated methodology for developing robust autonomous systems capable of handling the foundational excavation tasks required for future space missions.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous microrobots for minimally invasive therapies in blood vessels by solving navigation challenges posed by dense, moving obstacles.

Method: Couples analytic geometry global planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers (rule-based and reinforcement learning-based) using real-time imaging to estimate positions and compute collision-free motions.

Result: AGP outperforms WA*, PSO, and RRT with shorter paths and faster planning; extended to 3D without speed loss; 40ms average planning time compatible with 25fps real-time control; reliable obstacle avoidance in simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: The framework advances autonomous microrobot navigation and enables targeted drug delivery in vascular environments with real-time performance.

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entertainment robots like Cosmo present unique challenges due to aesthetic-driven design choices including disproportionately large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that restrict movement, requiring specialized approaches beyond traditional humanoid locomotion.

Method: Applied Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with tailored domain randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to enable natural-looking movements while maintaining physical stability and ensuring safe sim-to-real transfer to protect hardware components.

Result: AMP successfully generated stable standing and walking behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints, demonstrating functional performance while maintaining aesthetic appeal.

Conclusion: Learning-based methods like AMP can effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints, establishing a promising direction for entertainment robots that balance visual appeal with functional locomotion capabilities.

Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic

TL;DR: RL-based framework using GNN for multi-robot task allocation, scheduling and motion planning in obstacle-rich environments, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning for multiple robots in shared workspaces is computationally challenging and currently relies on manual human design in industry applications.

Method: Graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning on procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. Uses graph representation of scenes to generate trajectories solving task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning jointly.

Result: Successfully tested with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in obstacle-rich shared workspace. Policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. Enables high-speed planning for workcell layout optimization.

Conclusion: The approach provides scalable, fast multi-robot planning that enables new capabilities like fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

TL;DR: Using 3D generative models to create imagined datasets from single demonstrations, enabling omnidirectional policies that work from unseen starting positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of real-world demonstrations needed for robot policy learning by leveraging 3D generative models for data augmentation.

Method: Generate 3D object shapes from few images, create imagined dataset from single demonstration, train omnidirectional policy within this augmented dataset.

Result: Enables robots to perform tasks from states far from demonstration positions, reduces demonstration requirements, outperforms alternative data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 3D generative models provide effective data augmentation for robotics, enabling robust omnidirectional policies from minimal real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-loop grasping methods struggle in cluttered environments due to prediction errors and object pose changes, while existing closed-loop methods are limited to simple settings with no path to generalization.

Method: Uses MPC framework with a value function trained on 2M synthetic grasp trajectories, combined with cost terms for collision avoidance and smooth execution.

Result: Improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy, transformer policy, and IQL approaches.

Conclusion: Grasp-MPC demonstrates effective closed-loop grasping for diverse objects in cluttered environments, showing strong generalization capabilities and robustness to real-world noise.

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,

TL;DR: eKalibr-Inertial is an accurate spatiotemporal calibration method for event-based visual-inertial systems using circle grid boards, featuring rigorous initialization and continuous-time batch optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and low power consumption but require accurate spatiotemporal calibration with inertial sensors for optimal visual-inertial fusion in ego-motion estimation.

Method: Builds upon eKalibr's grid pattern recognition, uses rigorous initialization to recover all parameters, followed by continuous-time-based batch optimization to refine parameters.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration capabilities.

Conclusion: eKalibr-Inertial provides an effective solution for spatiotemporal calibration of event-based visual-inertial systems and is open-sourced for community benefit.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at
(https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.

TL;DR: One-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning approach that combines vision foundation models with point cloud representations for robotic manipulation, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works focus on single-object affordance, but real-world interactions involve object pairs. Need to address object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data constraints.

Method: Combines semantic features from 2D vision foundation models with point cloud geometric understanding for one-shot learning. Integrates 3D affordance representation with LLMs for robotic manipulation task reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and generalization capability for 3D object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed O³Afford approach effectively addresses object-to-object affordance learning with limited data and enhances LLMs' reasoning about object interactions for robotic tasks.

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Motivation: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers suffer from low data efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance.

Method: Model-based reinforcement learning with Dyna-Style paradigm, appending synthetic data to standard rollouts using a predictive model trained alongside policy, with gradual integration scheduling based on policy update iterations.

Result: Replacing simulated steps with synthetic ones mimics extended rollouts, improves policy return, reduces variance, and enables tracking of wide locomotion commands using fewer simulated steps.

Conclusion: The MBRL framework successfully enhances sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion while maintaining or improving performance, demonstrating effective transfer to real-world command tracking.

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models have shown competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, their application to robot policy learning remains largely unexplored despite the progress in auto-regressive vision-language models for robotics.

Method: Two key designs: (1) localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification to reduce adaptation difficulty, and (2) hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering dependencies within and across actions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language-action models on both simulation and real-world robots.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap between diffusion-based vision-language models and robotic manipulation, showing that pretrained d-VLMs can be effectively adapted for robotic policy learning with the proposed architectural innovations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models use reactive state-to-action mappings that lead to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic visual environments.

Method: F1 uses a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control. It employs next-scale prediction to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as planning targets, reformulating action generation as foresight-guided inverse dynamics.

Result: Extensive evaluations show F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches with substantial gains in task success rate and generalization ability across real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: F1 successfully bridges understanding, generation, and actions through visual foresight, demonstrating robust and generalizable capabilities for complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

TL;DR: DRP is a visuo-motor neural motion policy that combines a transformer-based policy pretrained on 10M expert trajectories with reactive modules for dynamic obstacle avoidance, achieving superior performance in cluttered and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical motion planners require full environment knowledge and are too slow for dynamic scenes, while neural policies struggle with generalization in complex dynamic settings. There's a need for reactive motion generation that works directly on sensory inputs.

Method: Combines IMPACT (transformer-based policy pretrained on 10M expert trajectories) with iterative student-teacher finetuning for static obstacle avoidance and DCP-RMP (reactive goal-proposal module) for dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time.

Result: DRP achieves strong generalization and outperforms prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings with cluttered scenes, dynamic obstacles, and goal obstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed Deep Reactive Policy framework effectively addresses the challenge of generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments by combining learned policies with reactive modules.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

*Sam Davidson,Li Sun,Bhavana Bhasker,Laurent Callot,Anoop Deoras*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Multi-IaC-Bench is a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM-based Infrastructure as Code generation across AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and CDK formats, showing LLMs achieve >95% syntactic validity but struggle with semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized IaC formats across cloud providers requires proficiency in multiple languages, and existing LLM approaches lack comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating IaC generation across different formats.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset with triplets of initial IaC templates, natural language modification requests, and updated templates using a synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Modern LLMs achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically valid IaC across multiple formats, but face significant challenges in semantic alignment and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Prompt engineering and retry mechanisms are crucial for success.

Conclusion: Multi-IaC-Bench provides a standardized evaluation framework for AI-assisted infrastructure management, highlighting both the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs in IaC generation while facilitating further research in this domain.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is fundamental to modern cloud computing,
enabling teams to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable
configuration files. However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse
IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be
proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and
maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks
across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark
dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset
consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language
modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a
synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while
modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically
valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment
and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Our ablation studies highlight
the importance of prompt engineering and retry mechanisms in successful IaC
generation. We release Multi-IaC-Bench to facilitate further research in
AI-assisted infrastructure management and establish standardized evaluation
metrics for this crucial domain.

### [438] [FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06261)
*Kyungmin Bin,Seungbeom Choi,Jimyoung Son,Jieun Choi,Daseul Bae,Daehyeon Baek,Kihyo Moon,Minsung Jang,Hyojung Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FineServe is an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs that addresses memory fragmentation and scheduling challenges through precision-aware KV cache management and two-level scheduling, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized LLMs enable higher throughput and reduced memory usage but suffer from memory fragmentation due to smaller KV block sizes and require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput when serving mixed-precision models.

Method: FineServe uses (1) KV Slab - precision-aware adaptive memory management that dynamically allocates KV cache based on quantization characteristics, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework with global model placement and local batch size adjustment.

Result: Experimental results show FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.

Conclusion: FineServe effectively addresses memory fragmentation and scheduling challenges in serving mixed-precision LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have
significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models
(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with
minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and
enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,
quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing
limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource
usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient
scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose
FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's
key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory
management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model
quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,
and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that
places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory
constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch
sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results
demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x
higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing
systems.

*David Combei*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Lexical content from speech can outperform acoustic models in speech emotion recognition, achieving 51.5% WF1 vs 49.3% for acoustic-only on MELD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether lexical content extracted from speech can compete with or outperform traditional acoustic-based approaches in speech emotion recognition, challenging the assumption that paralinguistic cues are primary drivers.

Method: Used lexical-based approach with different self-supervised speech and text representations, conducted layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluated audio denoising effects.

Result: Lexical approach achieved 51.5% weighted F1-score on MELD dataset, outperforming acoustic-only pipeline (49.3%) despite having smaller parameter count.

Conclusion: Lexical content plays a significant role in speech emotion recognition and can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to acoustic models, suggesting both modalities should be considered in SER systems.

Abstract: Although paralinguistic cues are often considered the primary drivers of
speech emotion recognition (SER), we investigate the role of lexical content
extracted from speech and show that it can achieve competitive and in some
cases higher performance compared to acoustic models. On the MELD dataset, our
lexical-based approach obtains a weighted F1-score (WF1) of 51.5%, compared to
49.3% for an acoustic-only pipeline with a larger parameter count. Furthermore,
we analyze different self-supervised (SSL) speech and text representations,
conduct a layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluate the
effect of audio denoising.

TL;DR: Beamforming-LLM is a system that uses spatial audio and AI to help users recall missed conversations through natural language queries, providing summaries with spatial context and audio playback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help users semantically recall conversations they missed in multi-speaker environments, addressing the challenge of following conversations when attention is divided or temporarily distracted.

Method: Combines spatial audio capture with microphone arrays, beamforming for directional audio separation, Whisper transcription, vector embedding for semantic retrieval, and GPT-4o-mini for summarization with RAG approach.

Result: A user-friendly interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context information, and timestamped audio playback for retrieved conversation segments.

Conclusion: This system lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory systems with applications in assistive technology, meeting summarization, and context-aware spatial computing.

Abstract: We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically
recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The
system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such
as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?"
Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with
Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon
receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved,
temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a
lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly
interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped
audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory
systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting
summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.

### [441] [Graph Connectionist Temporal Classification for Phoneme Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05399)
*Henry Grafé,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Using Graph Temporal Classification (GTC) instead of standard CTC loss for Automatic Phoneme Recognition allows models to handle multiple pronunciations per word from G2P systems, improving phoneme error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CTC loss cannot handle ambiguity in G2P-generated phoneme annotations where multiple pronunciations per word are possible, limiting training effectiveness.

Method: Adapted Graph Temporal Classification (GTC) to APR setting to train from graphs of alternative phoneme sequences, enabling consideration of multiple valid pronunciations per word.

Result: Experiments on English and Dutch datasets showed consistent improvements in phoneme error rates compared to CTC baseline when incorporating multiple pronunciations.

Conclusion: Integrating pronunciation variation into the loss function via GTC is a promising strategy for training APR systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.

Abstract: Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo
phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P)
systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations
per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph
Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a
graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple
pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and
Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into
the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a
baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation
variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR
systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.

*Davide Berghi,Philip J. B. Jackson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal approach for 3D stereo sound event localization and detection with distance estimation, integrating pre-trained language-aligned models (CLAP for audio, OWL-ViT for vision) into a Cross-Modal Conformer architecture to overcome data limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SELD approaches rely on multichannel input and face data constraints that limit large-scale pre-training. The semantic dimension is particularly challenging to model in 3D SELD tasks that require reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions.

Method: Enhanced standard SELD architecture by integrating pre-trained contrastive language-aligned models (CLAP for audio, OWL-ViT for visual inputs) into a modified Conformer module called Cross-Modal Conformer. Used large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets with left-right channel swapping augmentation for pre-training, combined model ensembling and visual post-processing.

Result: The approach achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), demonstrating effectiveness through extensive pre-training and multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: The integration of language-aligned models and multimodal fusion effectively addresses the semantic challenges in 3D SELD. Future work will explore modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.

Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event
localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular
video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event
classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial,
temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to
model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input,
limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data
constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on
the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the
individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against
the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process
of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training.
These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping
augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling,
and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge
Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work
will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.

*Tanujit Chakraborty,Donia Besher,Madhurima Panja,Shovon Sengupta*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: Proposes Neural ARFIMA model combining long-memory ARFIMA with neural networks to forecast BRIC exchange rates, outperforming state-of-the-art models across multiple horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exchange rate forecasting for emerging economies like BRIC is challenging due to long memory, nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and multiple external drivers that conventional models struggle to capture.

Method: Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that integrates ARFIMA's long-memory representation with neural networks' nonlinear learning capacity, incorporating exogenous variables and using conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification.

Result: NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models across six forecast horizons for BRIC exchange rate forecasting.

Conclusion: The model provides a flexible framework for handling complex exchange rate dynamics and offers valuable insights for policymakers and market participants, with implementation available in an R package.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge,
particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China
(BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity
properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture.
Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics,
including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US
monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific
short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore
the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long
memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these
challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving
Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA
with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly
incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties
of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using
Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast
uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework.
Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently
outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in
forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for
policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions.
The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our
approach.

*Zhongyuan Zhao,Gunjan Verma,Ananthram Swami,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: GNN-based distributed link sparsification reduces scheduling overhead in dense wireless networks while maintaining network capacity for delay-tolerant traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense wireless networks suffer from significant signaling overhead in distributed link scheduling, causing congestion, high energy consumption, and expanded radio footprints.

Method: A graph neural network (GNN) module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for individual links using traffic statistics and network topology, enabling links to withdraw from scheduling when unlikely to succeed. Uses offline constrained unsupervised learning to balance minimizing overhead while maintaining required utility levels.

Result: In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, the technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based link sparsification scheme successfully reduces scheduling overhead while preserving network capacity, making it suitable for delay-tolerant traffic in dense wireless environments.

Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant
signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can
exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint
expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link
sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce
scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network
capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for
individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling
links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.
Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}
learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing
scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.
In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link
sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces
radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.

*Xuanhao Luo,Shivesh Madan Nath Jha,Akruti Sinha,Zhizhen Li,Yuchen Liu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ALPHA is an active learning pipeline that automates log anomaly detection using LLM-assisted few-shot annotation and clustering, achieving supervised-level accuracy with minimal human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional log analysis methods require extensive labeled data and human expertise, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. ALPHA aims to automate anomaly detection while reducing human involvement.

Method: Integrates semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and LLM-assisted few-shot annotation with a two-step refinement strategy that adapts prompts based on LLM error patterns.

Result: Achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods while significantly reducing human effort, and provides interpretable root cause explanations through LLM-driven analysis.

Conclusion: ALPHA provides a scalable, cost-efficient solution for automated log-based anomaly detection with minimal supervision requirements and interpretable post-detection analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Network log data analysis plays a critical role in detecting security threats
and operational anomalies. Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly
detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully
supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and
significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the
first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates
semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large
language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly
detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters,
enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision.
To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement
strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's
observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets
demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully
supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also
supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in
the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and
cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.

*Saghar Ganji,Mohammad Naisipour,Alireza Hassani,Arash Adib*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Top-performing ensemble members significantly outperform the ensemble mean in ENSO forecasting, with skill improvements increasing dramatically at longer lead times, especially during crucial transition periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current operational ENSO forecasting systems use simple ensemble means assuming equal skill across members, but this study demonstrates that superior forecasting performance can be achieved by identifying and using high-skill subsets of ensemble members.

Method: Used a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system cross-validated against 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, identifying Top-5 subsets ranked on lowest RMSE and highest Pearson correlation from a large ensemble.

Result: Top-performing members showed substantially higher correlation and lower RMSE than ensemble mean, with advantages increasing dramatically with lead time (up to +172% correlation improvement and 22.5% RMSE reduction at 23-month leads), particularly during critical ENSO transition periods like SON and DJF.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for identifying high-quality ensemble members to enhance ENSO forecasting skill, demonstrating that selective use of superior ensemble members can significantly improve long-term forecasting performance compared to simple ensemble means.

Abstract: The accurate long-term forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
is still one of the biggest challenges in climate science. While it is true
that short-to medium-range performance has been improved significantly using
the advances in deep learning, statistical dynamical hybrids, most operational
systems still use the simple mean of all ensemble members, implicitly assuming
equal skill across members. In this study, we demonstrate, through a strictly
a-posteriori evaluation , for any large enough ensemble of ENSO forecasts,
there is a subset of members whose skill is substantially higher than that of
the ensemble mean. Using a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system
cross-validated against the 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, we identify two
Top-5 subsets one ranked on lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and another on
highest Pearson correlation. Generally across all leads, these outstanding
members show higher correlation and lower RMSE, with the advantage rising
enormously with lead time. Whereas at short leads (1 month) raises the mean
correlation by about +0.02 (+1.7%) and lowers the RMSE by around 0.14 {\deg}C
or by 23.3% compared to the All-40 mean, at extreme leads (23 months) the
correlation is raised by +0.43 (+172%) and RMSE by 0.18 {\deg}C or by 22.5%
decrease. The enhancements are largest during crucial ENSO transition periods
such as SON and DJF, when accurate amplitude and phase forecasting is of
greatest socio-economic benefit, and furthermore season-dependent e.g.,
mid-year months such as JJA and MJJ have incredibly large RMSE reductions. This
study provides a solid foundation for further investigations to identify
reliable clues for detecting high-quality ensemble members, thereby enhancing
forecasting skill.

TL;DR: A practical guide to spectral methods for analyzing complex systems across disciplines, focusing on matrix identities, inversion techniques, and connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an accessible, unified introduction to spectral methods that serves as an operative manual rather than a theoretical textbook, making these tools applicable across physics, mathematics, computer science and other fields.

Method: Compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, development of connections between spectra, dynamics and structure in finite-dimensional systems using eigenvalues, eigenvectors and resolvent operators.

Result: A comprehensive reference that enables applications ranging from dynamical stability, random walks, economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, circuits, synchronization to financial stability.

Conclusion: Spectral methods provide a common language linking diverse complex systems problems, with eigenvalues, eigenvectors and resolvent operators serving as fundamental tools accessible to both students and researchers.

Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of
complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a
theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives
that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of
matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections
between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems.
Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to
input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits,
synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding
principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a
common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and
beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates,
yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral
approaches to complex systems.

TL;DR: A language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet polymer composites that captures structured information from research papers to enable high-fidelity retrieval and AI-driven materials discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chemical research relies on narrative descriptions that limit what databases and machine learning can exploit, creating a need for structured language-based data systems.

Method: Developed a heterogeneous database that captures lightly structured information from papers across preparation, characterization, theory, and reasoning, using composite retrieval with semantics, keywords, and value filters.

Result: The system can synthesize literature into accurate, verifiable expert guidance and enables high-fidelity Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-augmented agents for actionable standard operating procedures.

Conclusion: This framework provides the language-rich foundation required for LLM-driven materials discovery by organizing research knowledge in a queryable, structured format that bridges narrative descriptions with computational analysis.

Abstract: Chemical and materials research has traditionally relied heavily on knowledge
narrative, with progress often driven by language-based descriptions of
principles, mechanisms, and experimental experiences, rather than tables,
limiting what conventional databases and ML can exploit. We present a
language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer thermally
conductive composites that captures lightly structured information from papers
across preparation, characterization, theory-computation, and mechanistic
reasoning, with evidence-linked snippets. Records are organized in a
heterogeneous database and queried via composite retrieval with semantics, key
words and value filters. The system can synthesizes literature into accurate,
verifiable, and expert style guidance. This substrate enables high fidelity
efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to
interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework to quantify three systematic biases in LLM opinion dynamics: topic bias, agreement bias, and anchoring bias, revealing how opinion trajectories converge and how fine-tuning affects opinion attractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion dynamics, but systematic biases obscure the effect of genuine interaction, necessitating a framework to disentangle and quantify these biases.

Method: Present a Bayesian framework to quantify three biases: topic bias (toward prior opinions), agreement bias (favoring agreement), and anchoring bias (toward initiating agent's stance). Applied to multi-step dialogues and fine-tuned LLMs on opinionated statements including misinformation.

Result: Opinion trajectories quickly converge to a shared attractor with interaction influence fading over time. Biases impact different LLMs differently. Fine-tuning on opinionated statements shifts the opinion attractor correspondingly.

Conclusion: The approach reveals stark differences between LLMs and provides quantitative tools to compare them to human subjects, highlighting both opportunities and pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion
dynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic
biases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such
biases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an
agreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an
anchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to
multi-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge
to a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time,
and the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an
LLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation)
and demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing
stark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them
to human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and
pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of low-altitude economy creates critical need for effective perception and intent recognition of non-cooperative UAVs, where MLLMs' generative reasoning capabilities show promise.

Method: MLLM-enabled UAV intent recognition architecture that uses multimodal perception system to obtain real-time payload/motion information, generates structured input, and incorporates environmental info, prior knowledge, and tactical preferences for intent recognition.

Conclusion: The paper discusses future challenges and provides strategic recommendations for further applications of MLLM-based UAV intent recognition systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy emphasizes the critical
need for effective perception and intent recognition of non-cooperative
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The advanced generative reasoning capabilities
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) present a promising approach in
such tasks. In this paper, we focus on the combination of UAV intent
recognition and the MLLMs. Specifically, we first present an MLLM-enabled UAV
intent recognition architecture, where the multimodal perception system is
utilized to obtain real-time payload and motion information of UAVs, generating
structured input information, and MLLM outputs intent recognition results by
incorporating environmental information, prior knowledge, and tactical
preferences. Subsequently, we review the related work and demonstrate their
progress within the proposed architecture. Then, a use case for low-altitude
confrontation is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture
and offer valuable insights for practical system design. Finally, the future
challenges are discussed, followed by corresponding strategic recommendations
for further applications.

*Juan D. Gil,Ehecatl Antonio Del Rio Chanona,José L. Guzmán,Manuel Berenguel*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: RL+BC hybrid control for pH regulation in open photobioreactors reduces error by 8% vs PID and 5% vs standard RL, while cutting control effort by 54% and 7% respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Living cells in open photobioreactors face complex challenges due to fluctuating environments, requiring stable bioprocess conditions that traditional controllers struggle to maintain.

Method: Hybrid offline-online reinforcement learning with behavior cloning: offline training from PID controller trajectories, followed by daily online fine-tuning for adaptation to process dynamics and disturbance rejection.

Result: 8% reduction in Integral of Absolute Error compared to PID, 5% reduction vs standard RL; 54% lower control effort than PID, 7% lower than standard RL; validated over 8-day experiment under varying conditions.

Conclusion: RL-based methods show strong potential for bioprocess control in nonlinear, disturbance-prone systems, paving the way for broader applications beyond photobioreactors.

Abstract: The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major
challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially
in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address
this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with
Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,
to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control
strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method
begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from
trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed
by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process
dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid
offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable
of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open
PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral
of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%
relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased
substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an
important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day
experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the
robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work
demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves
the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone
systems.

*Nitin Gupta,Bapi Dutta,Anupam Yadav*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper investigates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) topologies to improve algorithm interpretability and explainability, using landscape analysis and empirical comparisons of Ring, Star, and Von Neumann architectures to develop an explainable benchmarking framework and automated configuration system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swarm intelligence algorithms lack transparency in how components influence performance, hindering widespread adoption. The research aims to understand PSO topologies for better interpretability and explainability.

Method: Developed comprehensive landscape characterization using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA), conducted empirical study comparing three swarm topologies, created explainable benchmarking framework, and introduced machine learning approach for automated algorithm configuration using Area over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data.

Result: Systematic experimentation across 24 benchmark functions established practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration, advancing development of more transparent swarm intelligence systems.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into how swarm topologies affect information flow, diversity, and convergence, enabling more reliable and explainable PSO implementations with automated configuration recommendations based on problem characteristics.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread
adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic
components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted
investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the
key role of different topologies for better interpretability and
explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive
landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)
to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the
optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study
comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star,
and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on
exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality
and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode
how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence.
Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm
configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area
over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on
problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four
benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines
for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the
development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems. The

*Benjamin Savinson,David J. Norris,Siddhartha Mishra,Samuel Lanthaler*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper establishes a fundamental theorem for physical neural network universality and demonstrates a scalable optical architecture that achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The enormous energy demand of AI is driving development of alternative hardware like physical neural networks, but the inability to determine if these systems can learn arbitrary relationships (universality) hinders progress.

Method: The authors present a fundamental theorem establishing universality conditions for physical neural networks, propose a scalable free-space optics architecture, and combine the theorem with temporal multiplexing for practical on-chip photonic devices.

Result: The proposed optical architecture is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks, while temporal multiplexing enables potentially huge effective system sizes in practical photonic devices.

Conclusion: The theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further development efforts in this field.

Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the
development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks
try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently.
In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible
energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the
linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been
demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our
inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary
relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as
universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem
that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It
provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints,
detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the
physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using
free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on
image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal
multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in
highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and
scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide
class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying
further efforts in their development.

### [454] [Meta-training of diffractive meta-neural networks for super-resolution direction of arrival estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05926)
*Songtao Yang,Sheng Gao,Chu Wu,Zejia Zhao,Haiou Zhang,Xing Lin*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) combine metasurfaces with neural networks for super-resolution direction of arrival estimation, achieving 7x better angular resolution than diffraction limit and high-throughput processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffractive neural networks struggle with integrating large-scale multidimensional metasurfaces and precise training, and haven't utilized multidimensional EM field coding for super-resolution sensing applications.

Method: DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to characterize meta-atom responses across polarizations and frequencies, using gradient-based meta-training for inverse design. It employs multidimensional multiplexing and coding through x/y-polarization channels and frequency-multiplexed angular intervals to generate spectral-encoded optical super-oscillations.

Result: A three-layer DMNN operating at 27, 29, and 31 GHz achieved ~7x Rayleigh diffraction-limited angular resolution (0.5°), mean absolute error of 0.048° for two targets within ±11.5° field of view, and angular estimation throughput 1917 (order of magnitude higher than existing methods).

Conclusion: The DMNN architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications in EM field modulation and sensing.

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of
electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the
existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale
multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't
utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing.
Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field
modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and
coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction
of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to
characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different
polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed
using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle
estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles
through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of
frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical
super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation.
Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the
performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at
27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited
angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for
two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular
estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing
methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing
systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods
for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.

TL;DR: A build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ surface reconstruction in laser-DED additive manufacturing, achieving ±46μm accuracy and enabling automated defect detection without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed energy deposition (DED) is highly susceptible to process-induced defects like geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish, requiring effective in-situ monitoring solutions.

Method: Developed a fringe projection system synchronized with build height for layer-wise surface reconstruction. Introduced two geometry-based point cloud metrics: local point density (for surface finish) and normal-change rate (for lack-of-fusion defects).

Result: Achieved reconstruction accuracy of ±46μm. Successfully enabled automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between process signatures and part geometry, enabling precise anomaly localization and advancing closed-loop process control for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure equitable access to information across diverse languages by making semantically identical queries in different languages yield equivalent ranking results from the same multilingual document collection.

Method: Evaluated traditional retrieval methods and DPR neural ranker (based on mBERT and XLM-R), and introduced LaKDA - a novel loss function designed to reduce language biases in neural MLIR approaches.

Result: Analysis revealed intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies with notable disparities across retrieval methods, and demonstrated the effectiveness of LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed LaKDA loss effectively mitigates language biases in multilingual information retrieval systems, promoting more equitable access to information across different languages.

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in
different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent
ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate
the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of
LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

TL;DR: Using entropy of retrieval score distributions to dynamically route between exploration and exploitation in conversational recommender systems with LLMs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making recommendations) is challenging in conversational recommender systems, especially with large language models and vast product catalogs

Method: Model user interest breadth via entropy of retrieval score distributions. Use neural retriever to fetch relevant items, compute entropy of re-ranked scores to dynamically route dialogue policy: low-entropy queries trigger direct recommendations, high-entropy queries prompt exploratory questions

Result: Simple yet effective strategy that allows LLM-driven agents to handle arbitrarily large catalogs in real-time without bloating context windows

Conclusion: Entropy-based routing provides an efficient way to balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale conversational recommender systems

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce,
but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making
recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language
models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling
the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions.
Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and
computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue
policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas
high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet
effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily
large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: RL-based graph drawing approach for minimizing global and local edge crossings, using stress-based initial layout and local reward signals for vertex positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reinforcement learning approach for graph drawing that can optimize both global and local crossing numbers, addressing limitations of traditional force- and stress-based algorithms.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning where an agent learns to move vertices based on observation vectors to optimize positions, with local reward signals for crossing reduction. Starts with stress-based initial layout.

Result: Mixed results - mainly competitive for local crossing number minimization compared to force- and stress-based baseline algorithms and three established crossing minimization algorithms on benchmark graphs.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for future development, particularly for local crossing minimization, but requires further refinement to be broadly competitive across both global and local crossing metrics.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning
for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total
number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge,
respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a
given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives
feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To
generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We
compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as
well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a
suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current
algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a
potential for further development of the approach in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase information capacity in environments where visual sensors fail, by developing acoustic landmark systems with higher information entropy through encoded reflector constellations.

Method: Developed a multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for simultaneous identification of multiple reflectors from single 3D sonar measurements, and investigated adaptive beamforming with null-steering for isolating individual reflectors.

Result: Initial findings on a small dataset confirmed feasibility of decoding complex acoustic patterns and demonstrated the ability to identify multiple closely spaced reflectors simultaneously.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for developing acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information capacity, though limitations exist and future work is needed for more robust detection and classification.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable
alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully
classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as

Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced
reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a

to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for

TL;DR: A green learning framework for STAR-RIS-aided mmWave MIMO broadcasting systems that operates without explicit CSI estimation, reduces computational complexity by 4 orders of magnitude, and achieves competitive spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address environmental sustainability in 6G networks by improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions/power consumption in broadcasting scenarios where multiple users share identical information.

Method: GL framework integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test-based supervised feature selection, and XGBoost-based decision learning to jointly predict STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder without explicit CSI estimation.

Result: Achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models while reducing FLOPs by over four orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios due to lightweight design and CSI-free operation.

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed
for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.
Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G
networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for
scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral
efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.
Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate
descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and
iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received
uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)
approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach
also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more
lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with
supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully
CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with
adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature
selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to
jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation
results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral
efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point
operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the
proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and
hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current joint detection tracking methods have limitations in fully utilizing radar signal potential, including inadequate constant false-alarm rate models, poor complex scene depiction, and limited tracker information acquisition.

Method: Integrated Detection and Tracking (InDT) with radar feature extraction network, feature enhancement module, detection head, and tracker that adaptively updates Kalman filter measurement noise covariance using detection confidence and cosine distance for feature similarity measurement.

Result: The method was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed InDT method effectively addresses limitations of current approaches by better utilizing radar signal information through integrated feature-based detection and tracking with adaptive filtering.

Abstract: Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint
detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection
thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing
the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited
capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent
information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited
information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and
Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network
architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection
assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each
Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the
feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively
updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on
detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by
cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining
location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method
was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available
datasets.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional constant-Hurst parameter models and computationally intensive forecasting methods by developing a mathematically tractable framework that dynamically adapts to evolving volatility regimes.

Method: Introduces a variance-driven exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) time-dependent Hurst parameter within a unified rough differential equation formulation grounded in rough path theory, with rigorous mathematical proofs of existence, uniqueness, and martingale properties.

Result: Empirical validation across equities, cryptocurrencies, and commodities demonstrates superior performance in capturing market dynamics and out-of-sample pricing accuracy compared to traditional constant-Hurst models.

Conclusion: The proposed rBergomi model with dynamic EWMA-based Hurst parameter provides a mathematically rigorous and empirically effective framework for capturing volatility clustering and roughness bursts across diverse asset classes.

Abstract: We introduce a novel rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model featuring a
variance-driven exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) time-dependent
Hurst parameter $H_t$, fundamentally distinct from recent machine learning and
wavelet-based approaches in the literature. Our framework pioneers a unified
rough differential equation (RDE) formulation grounded in rough path theory,
where the Hurst parameter dynamically adapts to evolving volatility regimes
through a continuous EWMA mechanism tied to instantaneous variance. Unlike
discrete model-switching or computationally intensive forecasting methods, our
approach provides mathematical tractability while capturing volatility
clustering and roughness bursts. We rigorously establish existence and
uniqueness of solutions via rough path theory and derive martingale properties.
Empirical validation on diverse asset classes including equities,
cryptocurrencies, and commodities demonstrates superior performance in
capturing dynamics and out-of-sample pricing accuracy. Our results show
significant improvements over traditional constant-Hurst models.

TL;DR: Link invariants like Jones and HOMFLYPT polynomials detect alternating links with exponentially decaying probability as crossing number increases, approaching zero asymptotically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of link invariants in detecting alternating links, particularly how their effectiveness diminishes as link complexity increases.

Method: Mathematical proof showing exponential decay of detection rates for n-crossing alternating links by mutation-insensitive invariants, supplemented by big data analysis of borderline cases like integral Khovanov and HOMFLYPT homologies.

Result: Detection probability decays exponentially with crossing number n, meaning these invariants detect alternating links with probability zero in the asymptotic limit. The same behavior is evidenced in borderline cases through data analysis.

Conclusion: Common quantum invariants are fundamentally limited in their ability to detect alternating links, with detection rates approaching zero as link complexity increases, which has implications for knot theory and quantum topology.

Abstract: We prove that the detection rate of n-crossing alternating links by link
invariants insensitive to oriented mutation decays exponentially in n, implying
that they detect alternating links with probability zero. This phenomenon
applies broadly, in particular to quantum invariants such as the Jones or
HOMFLYPT polynomials. We also use a big data approach to analyze several
borderline cases (e.g. integral Khovanov or HOMFLYPT homologies), where our
arguments almost, but not quite, apply, and we provide evidence that they too
exhibit the same asymptotic behavior.

TL;DR: Sesame is a generative model that predicts conformational changes in protein structures to improve molecular docking accuracy using ligand-free structures instead of costly ligand-bound ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular docking requires high-resolution ligand-bound structures that are expensive and time-consuming to obtain, while ligand-free structures are more accessible but perform poorly in docking due to unsuitable pocket geometries.

Method: Sesame uses generative modeling to efficiently predict conformational changes in protein structures, creating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at low computational cost compared to traditional methods like molecular dynamics simulations.

Result: The model generates improved pocket geometries for ligand accommodation, providing a scalable solution that reduces computational expense while enhancing docking performance.

Conclusion: Sesame offers an efficient alternative to traditional computationally expensive methods for preparing protein structures for molecular docking, potentially improving virtual screening workflows in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery, relying on
high-resolution ligand-bound structures to achieve accurate predictions.
However, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive,
limiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more
accessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries
being less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional
methods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular
dynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce

### [465] [Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978)
*Mohamed Mohamed,Brennan Nichyporuk,Douglas L. Arnold,Tal Arbel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First framework for generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images from natural language prompts using adapted 3D diffusion models, demonstrated on neurological MRI data for MS and Alzheimer's disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in 3D medical image generation where pretrained foundation models exist for 2D but not for 3D, enabling clinical applications like personalized counterfactual explanations, disease progression simulation, and enhanced medical training.

Method: Adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion, incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality, specifically applied to neurological MRI data.

Result: Successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging and represents the first demonstration of language-guided native-3D diffusion model for neurological imaging data.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

### [466] [A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05374)
*Zhiqiang Yuan,Jinchao Zhang,Jie Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A domain unification method for synthetic-to-real image dehazing that addresses performance degradation caused by distribution shift between synthetic and real hazy images due to imperfect clean data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based dehazing methods suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images due to distribution shift caused by imperfect collection of clean data that doesn't meet ideal atmospheric physics model conditions.

Method: Proposes a synthetic-to-real dehazing method based on domain unification, which unifies the relationship between real and synthetic domains to make the dehazing model more aligned with actual situations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Domain unification effectively addresses the distribution shift problem in image dehazing by bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains, leading to improved performance on real-world hazy images.

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

*Muraam Abdel-Ghani,Mahmoud Ali,Mohamed Ali,Fatmaelzahraa Ahmed,Mohamed Arsalan,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Shidin Balakrishnan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FASL-Seg model improves surgical scene segmentation by capturing both high-level contextual and low-level edge features through dual processing streams, achieving state-of-the-art performance on surgical benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical segmentation models focus mainly on tools and overlook anatomical objects, while current SOTA models struggle to balance high-level contextual features with low-level edge details needed for precise segmentation.

Method: Proposed Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg) with two distinct processing streams: Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) streams to handle varying feature resolutions for precise segmentation of both anatomy and surgical instruments.

Result: Achieved mIoU of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18 (5% improvement over SOTA), 85.61% mIoU on EndoVis18 tool type segmentation, and 72.78% mIoU on EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, outperforming SOTA overall with comparable per-class results.

Conclusion: FASL-Seg demonstrates effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions, enabling consistent performance across different classes for both anatomy and surgical instruments in robotic surgery segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

*Johan Andreas Balle Rubak,Khuram Naveed,Sanyam Jain,Lukas Esterle,Alexandros Iosifidis,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Federated learning outperforms centralized and local learning for tooth segmentation in dental radiographs across various data corruption scenarios while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI by comparing federated learning with centralized and local approaches.

Method: Trained Attention U-Net on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four scenarios: baseline, label manipulation, image-quality manipulation, and faulty client exclusion. Used Flower AI framework for FL implementation and monitored loss trajectories for anomaly detection.

Result: FL achieved best performance across all scenarios: baseline (Dice: 0.94889), label manipulation (Dice: 0.94884), image noise (Dice: 0.94853), and faulty-client exclusion (Dice: 0.94790). Loss-curve monitoring reliably detected corrupted data.

Conclusion: FL matches or exceeds centralized learning and outperforms local learning while preserving privacy, making it a practical approach for scalable clinical AI deployment with effective anomaly detection.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen

enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects

robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,

*Daniel Scholz,Ayhan Can Erdur,Viktoria Ehm,Anke Meyer-Baese,Jan C. Peeken,Daniel Rueckert,Benedikt Wiestler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MM-DINOv2 adapts DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging with patch embeddings, full-modality masking for missing data, and semi-supervised learning, achieving 11.1% improvement in glioma classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 are designed for uni-modal analysis but struggle with multi-modal medical imaging tasks and missing modalities common in clinical settings.

Method: Multi-modal patch embeddings, full-modality masking to handle missing data, and semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled datasets.

Result: Achieved Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.6 on external test set for glioma subtype classification, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging that addresses real-world clinical challenges like missing data and limited annotations.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited
annotations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes evolutionary optimization for adversarial attacks to test outlier detection methods in subjective quality assessment, revealing performance differences and introducing two new low-complexity methods with excellent worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of reliable and comprehensive approach for comparative performance analysis of outlier detection methods in subjective image/video quality assessment, where identifying unreliable ratings is crucial before calculating mean opinion scores.

Method: Empirical worst-case analysis using evolutionary optimization of adversarial black-box attacks on outlier detection algorithms, where adversaries maximize distortion of scale values relative to ground truth.

Result: Applied analysis to several hard and soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings, showing their differing performance under stress testing. Two new low-complexity outlier detection methods demonstrated excellent worst-case performance.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial attack framework provides a general solution for comprehensive performance evaluation of outlier detection methods, with new methods offering superior worst-case performance at low computational complexity.

Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or
compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for
these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with
outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available
for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are
typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic
ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable
and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of
outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an
empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves
evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier
detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale
values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and
soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their
differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new
outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case
performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.

*Yongyi Guo,Ziping Xu*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: LinUCB and similar contextual bandit algorithms may fail to converge when reward models are misspecified, creating inference problems. The paper proposes new algorithms that guarantee convergence under misspecification and develops a valid inference framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem that widely used contextual bandandit algorithms like LinUCB fail to converge when reward models are misspecified, which creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference in adaptive experiments.

Method: Propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms guaranteed to converge under model misspecification, and develop an inference framework based on inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) with asymptotic normality and consistent variance estimation.

Result: Simulation studies confirm the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals, outperforming existing approaches that only work in offline policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: Designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence guarantees is crucial for stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in practice, especially when dealing with potentially misspecified models.

Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by
enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of
data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to
adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy
convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in
probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive
experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a
previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to
converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence
creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is
practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations
of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive
experiments to balance bias and variance.
  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms
that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on
this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an
inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic
normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that
the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,
and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of
offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the
importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence
guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in
practice.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: XAI in HR recruitment dashboards improves subjective trust for moderately/highly AI-literate users but doesn't enhance objective understanding and may even reduce it with complex explanations. Only important features overlays helped high-literacy users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI recommender systems increasingly influence hiring decisions, making transparency and responsible adoption critical in HRM. Need to understand how HR managers' AI literacy affects their perception and understanding of XAI elements.

Method: Online experiment with 410 German HR managers comparing baseline dashboards to versions with three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria.

Result: Current dashboards lack AI explanations and keep elements opaque. XAI improved subjective helpfulness/trust for moderate/high AI-literate users but didn't increase objective understanding - may even reduce it with complex explanations. Only important features overlays helped high-literacy users.

Conclusion: XAI benefits in recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, requiring tailored explanation strategies and targeted literacy training for fair, transparent, and effective AI adoption in HRM.

Abstract: AI-based recommender systems increasingly influence recruitment decisions.
Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)
are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their
subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)
elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410
German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with
three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our
results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and
even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves
subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or
high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may
even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only
overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of
high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in
recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored
explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair,
transparent, and effective adoption of AI.

### [476] [Vector-based loss functions for turbulent flow field inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05787)
*Samuel J. Baker,Shubham Goswami,Xiaohang Fang,Felix C. P. Leach*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper introduces vector-based loss functions for scientific ML that preserve physical characteristics of turbulent flow data, showing improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns compared to standard mean-square error approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML loss functions treat velocity vector components in isolation, ignoring the vectorized nature of turbulent flow data from PIV/CFD measurements. This work aims to better preserve physical characteristics by using vector similarity metrics.

Method: Developed vector-based loss functions using cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences, implemented alongside a U-Net model for turbulent flow field inpainting (predicting velocity vectors in large gaps in PIV images). Tested on PIV data from TCC-III engine.

Result: Vector-based loss functions led to significantly improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns. A hybrid (vector + mean-square error) loss function provided a good compromise between preserving multi-scale behavior and pixel-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: Vector similarity metrics in loss functions better preserve physical characteristics of turbulent flow data, enabling improved scientific ML performance for flow field prediction tasks compared to standard component-wise approaches.

Abstract: When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often
beneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the
training process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific
characteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid
velocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete
points in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
computational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data
is ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the
mean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical
characteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector
similarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here
and implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting
problem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in
PIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant
challenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The
test case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known
Transparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on
the cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the
results show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly
improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and
mean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between
preserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.

Abstract: Complex, non-linear tasks challenge LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems (MAS)
due to partial observability and suboptimal coordination. We propose
Orchestrator, a novel MAS framework that leverages attention-inspired
self-emergent coordination and reflective benchmarking to optimize global task
performance. Orchestrator introduces a monitoring mechanism to track
agent-environment dynamics, using active inference benchmarks to optimize
system behavior. By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment
interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and
enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently. We
evaluate the framework on a series of maze puzzles of increasing complexity,

### [478] [Systematic Evaluation of Multi-modal Approaches to Complex Player Profile Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05624)
*Jason Starace,Terence Soule*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Multi-modal classification combining behavioral telemetry and semantic context achieves 21% accuracy for 36 player profiles, significantly outperforming behavioral-only approaches (10%) but showing limitations without conversational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional player modeling uses simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture player diversity, and behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who exhibit similar actions.

Method: Systematic evaluation using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled text-based RPG, comparing behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions using LSTM models processing action-text pairs.

Result: Multi-modal LSTM improved accuracy to 21% from 10% for behavioral-only approaches. Non-neutral profiles reached 42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x above random). Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories.

Conclusion: Personality-based adaptation requires conversational interaction as predefined choices cannot capture intent. Multi-modal integration enables better player understanding but has limitations without access to reasoning. The study establishes benchmarks for complex player modeling at scale.

Abstract: Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models
use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity.
Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who
act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification
at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36
player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled
text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal
approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.
Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category
classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced
identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved
accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.
Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached
42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x
above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal
whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to
reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results
confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains
unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.
Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal
integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based
adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot
capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for
building adaptive games that better understand their players.

*Xiangyu Liu,Haodi Lei,Yi Liu,Yang Liu,Wei Hu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ProtSAE is a semantically-guided sparse autoencoder that addresses semantic entanglement in protein language models by incorporating annotation datasets and domain knowledge during training, resulting in more biologically interpretable features while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) applied to protein language models suffer from semantic entanglement where neurons mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors for biological analysis.

Method: Proposed ProtSAE that guides semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge, unlike existing SAEs that require annotation datasets only for post-training filtering and interpretation.

Result: ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features, maintains high reconstruction fidelity, achieves better results in interpretable probing, and shows potential for steering protein language models in downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: ProtSAE effectively mitigates semantic entanglement in protein language models through semantic guidance during training, producing more interpretable biological features while preserving model performance, demonstrating value for mechanistic interpretability and downstream applications.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

*Diego Sanchez Espinosa,Erik H Thiede,Yunan Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework that models continuous structural heterogeneity using probability measures and statistical distances, solved via Wasserstein gradient flow with particle representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryo-EM methods assume discrete conformations, limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability in biomolecules.

Method: Formulates cryo-EM as a stochastic inverse problem over probability measures, minimizes variational discrepancy using KL divergence/MMD, and solves via Wasserstein gradient flow with particle evolution.

Result: Validated on synthetic examples including realistic protein models, demonstrating ability to recover continuous structural distributions and establishing connections to MAP approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a general methodology for solving stochastic inverse problems with random forward operators, with applications beyond cryo-EM reconstruction.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of
biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D
reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations,
limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this
work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP)
over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the
push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random
forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a
variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions,
using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of
probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically
solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We
validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein
model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over
structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and
Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of
the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency
analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP
estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional
continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general
methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.

TL;DR: RVNP is a robust variational neural posterior estimation method that addresses model misspecification in simulation-based inference by using variational inference and error modeling to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SBI methods perform poorly with model misspecification, which is problematic for real-world applications where simulators always misrepresent the true data generative process to some degree.

Method: Uses variational inference and error modeling to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap, enabling robust posterior estimation without tunable hyperparameters or priors for misspecification.

Result: Tested on multiple benchmark tasks including real astronomy data, RVNP successfully recovers robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner.

Conclusion: RVNP provides an effective solution for handling model misspecification in amortized SBI, making neural posterior estimation more reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful
simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian
inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have
demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately
represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown
that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses
a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators
always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we
introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which
addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We
test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from
astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a
data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing
the misspecification.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential in probabilistic machine
learning models, particularly for assessing the reliability of predictions. In
this paper, we present a systematic framework for estimating both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic models. We focus on Gaussian Process
Latent Variable Models and employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based

*Darinka Dentcheva,Xiangyu Tian*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new risk-averse classification framework using systemic risk measures for robust multi-class problems with noisy, scarce, and unreliable data, outperforming traditional expected error minimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-class classification when data is noisy, scarce relative to problem dimension, and labels are unreliable, requiring robust methods that go beyond minimizing expected classification errors.

Method: Developed classification framework based on coherent risk measures and systemic risk theory, including linear and kernel-based multi-class formulations, non-linear aggregation via system-theoretic approach leading to two-stage stochastic programming, and risk-averse regularized decomposition method.

Result: Numerical experiments show proposed methods are robust with unreliable training data, perform better on unknown data than expected error minimization methods, and improve performance as number of classes increases. Also enables enforcing fairness in classification.

Conclusion: The risk-averse classification framework using systemic risk measures provides theoretically and numerically supported robust performance, particularly effective for multi-class problems with data quality challenges, while also facilitating fairness enforcement.

Abstract: We develop a new classification framework based on the theory of coherent
risk measures and systemic risk. The proposed approach is suitable for
multi-class problems when the data is noisy, scarce (relative to the dimension
of the problem), and the labeling might be unreliable. In the first part of our
paper, we provide the foundation of the use of systemic risk models and show
how to apply it in the context of linear and kernel-based multi-class problems.
More advanced formulation via a system-theoretic approach with non-linear
aggregation is proposed, which leads to a two-stage stochastic programming
problem. A risk-averse regularized decomposition method is designed to solve
the problem. We use a popular multi-class method as a benchmark in the
performance analysis of the proposed classification methods. We illustrate our
ideas by proposing several generalization of that method by the use of coherent
measures of risk. The viability of the proposed risk-averse methods are
supported theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
application of systemic risk measures facilitates enforcing fairness in
classification. Analysis and experiments regarding the fairness of the proposed
models are carefully conducted. For all methods, our numerical experiments
demonstrate that they are robust in the presence of unreliable training data
and perform better on unknown data than the methods minimizing expected
classification errors. Furthermore, the performance improves when the number of
classes increases.

### [485] [Causal Clustering for Conditional Average Treatment Effects Estimation and Subgroup Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05775)
*Zilong Wang,Turgay Ayer,Shihao Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel framework for clustering individuals based on treatment effect heterogeneity using causal forests and kernelized clustering to identify meaningful subpopulations with different treatment responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is crucial for personalized interventions, but existing methods lack integration of clustering with causal inference to identify distinct treatment-responsive subgroups.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Estimate debiased CATEs using orthogonalized learners via Robinson decomposition to create a kernel matrix encoding treatment responsiveness similarities; 2) Apply kernelized clustering to uncover treatment-sensitive subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs.

Result: Extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity, supported by ablation studies and exploratory analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates causal inference with clustering methods to reveal latent subgroup structures, enabling more targeted decision-making in personalized medicine and policy evaluation.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as
personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central
challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to
interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making.
While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their
integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework
that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned
kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our
approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional
Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the
Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level
similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized
clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive
subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this
kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the
residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on
semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and
exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.

TL;DR: A semiparametric efficient estimator for contextual preference inference using Fisher random walk weights and residual balancing, enabling rigorous evaluation of large language models through pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for rigorous and scalable evaluation methods for large language models, particularly for contextual preference inference across different domains.

Method: Developed a semiparametric efficient estimator using Fisher random walk strategy for weight derivation, with potential representation of nuisance weight functions. Extended to multiple hypothesis testing with Gaussian multiplier bootstrap and distributional shift handling via cross-fitted importance-sampling.

Result: The method achieves efficiency when weights are derived from Fisher random walk strategy. Numerical studies including language model evaluations demonstrate accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility across diverse contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed inference procedure is valid for general score function estimators and accommodates flexible deep learning methods, providing a scalable solution for rigorous evaluation of large language models through contextual preference inference.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for rigorous and scalable evaluation of large language
models, we study contextual preference inference for pairwise comparison
functionals of context-dependent preference score functions across domains.
Focusing on the contextual Bradley-Terry-Luce model, we develop a
semiparametric efficient estimator that automates the debiased estimation
through aggregating weighted residual balancing terms across the comparison
graph. We show that the efficiency is achieved when the weights are derived
from a novel strategy called Fisher random walk. We also propose a
computationally feasible method to compute the weights by a potential
representation of nuisance weight functions. We show our inference procedure is
valid for general score function estimators accommodating the practitioners'
need to implement flexible deep learning methods. We extend the procedure to
multiple hypothesis testing using a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap that controls
familywise error and to distributional shift via a cross-fitted
importance-sampling adjustment for target-domain inference. Numerical studies,
including language model evaluations under diverse contexts, corroborate the
accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility of our method.

### [487] [Additive Distributionally Robust Ranking and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06147)
*Zaile Li,Yuchen Wan,L. Jeff Hong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes additive allocation procedures for distributionally robust ranking and selection that sample only k+m-1 critical scenarios, proving consistency and challenging prior beliefs about worst-case scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address input uncertainty in ranking and selection by modeling multiple plausible input distributions, with existing methods lacking theoretical justification for additive budget allocation properties.

Method: Propose simple additive allocation (AA) procedure that samples k+m-1 critical scenarios, then develop general additive allocation (GAA) framework incorporating traditional R&S sampling rules.

Result: Prove AA is consistent and achieves strong additivity - only k+m-1 scenarios sampled infinitely often. Numerical experiments show competitive performance of GAA procedures.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into additive structure of DRR&S, challenging prior beliefs about critical scenarios, and offers practical framework with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Ranking and selection (R&S) aims to identify the alternative with the best
mean performance among $k$ simulated alternatives. The practical value of R&S
depends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the
curse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking
and selection (DRR&S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty
via an ambiguity set of $m > 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in
$km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&S studies suggest a key structural insight:
additivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing
justifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency
and the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA)
procedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously
hypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we
establish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and
characterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior. We then prove that AA
is consistent and, surprisingly, achieves additivity in the strongest sense: as
the total budget increases, only $k + m - 1$ scenarios are sampled infinitely
often. Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be
among them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results
offer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&S.
To improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce
a general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates
sampling rules from traditional R&S procedures in a modular fashion. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the competitive
performance of the proposed GAA procedures.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a new inference framework for change-point detection in dynamic networks with low-rank and sparse-change structure, achieving near-minimax optimal detection rates with practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting change-points in dynamic networks that exhibit simultaneous low-rank structure and sparse changes, which requires specialized methods beyond traditional high-dimensional change-point detection approaches.

Method: Develops an eigen-decomposition-based test with screened signals, supplemented by a novel residual-based technique to create a pivotal statistic that converges to standard normal distribution under null hypothesis via martingale CLT.

Result: Establishes minimax detection boundary rates, shows the method approaches minimax rate with minor logarithmic loss, achieves full power under alternative hypothesis, and validates effectiveness through simulations and real data.

Conclusion: MOSAIC provides an effective framework for change-point detection in dynamic networks with low-rank sparse structure, achieving near-optimal theoretical performance and practical applicability across various scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a new inference framework, named MOSAIC, for change-point
detection in dynamic networks with the simultaneous low-rank and sparse-change
structure. We establish the minimax rate of detection boundary, which relies on
the sparsity of changes. We then develop an eigen-decomposition-based test with
screened signals that approaches the minimax rate in theory, with only a minor
logarithmic loss. For practical implementation of MOSAIC, we adjust the
theoretical test by a novel residual-based technique, resulting in a pivotal
statistic that converges to a standard normal distribution via the martingale
central limit theorem under the null hypothesis and achieves full power under
the alternative hypothesis. We also analyze the minimax rate of testing
boundary for dynamic networks without the low-rank structure, which almost
aligns with the results in high-dimensional mean-vector change-point inference.
We showcase the effectiveness of MOSAIC and verify our theoretical results with
several simulation examples and a real data application.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Transfer learning for high-dimensional additive regression with theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise, achieving minimax optimal rates when auxiliary and target distributions are sufficiently close.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high-dimensional additive regression problems using transfer learning, where auxiliary samples from related regression models can improve estimation of target population parameters, particularly under heavy-tailed error distributions.

Method: Two-stage estimation: 1) Target-only smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing; 2) Novel transfer learning framework incorporating auxiliary samples. Theoretical analysis under sub-Weibull noise conditions.

Result: Establishes general error bounds under sub-Weibull noise, shows minimax optimality for sub-exponential case, and demonstrates optimal rates when auxiliary-target distributions are sufficiently close. Supported by simulations and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning framework provides robust estimation for high-dimensional additive regression with theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise conditions, achieving optimal performance when auxiliary data is appropriately related to target.

Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer
learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population
together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related
regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based
on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to
previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$)
noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the
sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the
minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial
departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage
estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical
guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are
derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further
demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and
target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.

### [490] [Robust and Adaptive Spectral Method for Representation Multi-Task Learning with Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06575)
*Yian Huang,Yang Feng,Zhiliang Ying*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: RAS is a robust spectral method for multi-task learning that handles unknown high contamination levels and task heterogeneity without requiring prior knowledge of contamination proportion or true representation dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task learning methods assume clean or near-clean settings and fail when contamination is significant, limiting practical applications where tasks may contain outliers or adversarial content.

Method: Proposes Robust and Adaptive Spectral method (RAS) that distills shared inlier representation efficiently without prior knowledge of contamination level or true dimension. Uses spectral techniques to identify and separate inlier tasks from contaminated ones.

Result: Theoretical non-asymptotic error bounds show RAS adapts to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, prevents negative transfer, and performs at least as well as single-task learning. Experiments demonstrate robustness up to 80% task contamination.

Conclusion: RAS provides an effective solution for representation-based multi-task learning in contaminated settings, with theoretical guarantees and practical performance that overcome limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Representation-based multi-task learning (MTL) improves efficiency by
learning a shared structure across tasks, but its practical application is
often hindered by contamination, outliers, or adversarial tasks. Most existing
methods and theories assume a clean or near-clean setting, failing when
contamination is significant. This paper tackles representation MTL with an
unknown and potentially large contamination proportion, while also allowing for
heterogeneity among inlier tasks. We introduce a Robust and Adaptive Spectral
method (RAS) that can distill the shared inlier representation effectively and
efficiently, while requiring no prior knowledge of the contamination level or
the true representation dimension. Theoretically, we provide non-asymptotic
error bounds for both the learned representation and the per-task parameters.
These bounds adapt to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, and
guarantee that RAS performs at least as well as single-task learning, thus
preventing negative transfer. We also extend our framework to transfer learning
with corresponding theoretical guarantees for the target task. Extensive
experiments confirm our theory, showcasing the robustness and adaptivity of
RAS, and its superior performance in regimes with up to 80\% task
contamination.

TL;DR: MASH is an automated framework that harmonizes heterogeneous EHR data across institutions using neural optimal transport and hyperbolic embeddings to create interpretable hierarchical graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data heterogeneity across institutions limits interpretability, comparability, and scalability of analyses, creating barriers for large-scale translational research.

Method: Uses neural optimal transport to align medical codes and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic embeddings, integrating pre-trained language models, co-occurrence patterns, text descriptions, and supervised labels.

Result: Produces interpretable hierarchical graphs for diagnosis, medication, and lab codes, including the first automated hierarchies for unstructured local laboratory codes.

Conclusion: MASH enables meaningful insights from distributed EHR data and establishes foundational references for downstream applications in clinical research.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as
diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for
translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention,
improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence.
Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable
studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains
hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific
terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers
limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based
analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract
meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we
propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated
framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal
transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic
embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained
language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised
labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical
concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis,
medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical
graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous
clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for
unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for
downstream applications.

Motivation: To address the estimation problem in large-scale linear statistical models by integrating two existing methods (Sketch-and-Solve and Iterative-Sketching) for improved performance and precision.

Method: Sequentially constructs and solves sketched least-squares subproblems with progressively increasing sketch sizes, gradually refining parameter estimators through iterative refinement.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that SLSE-FRS outperforms state-of-the-art methods including Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and Iterative Double Sketching (IDS).

Conclusion: SLSE-FRS provides an effective framework for high-precision estimation in large-scale linear models, successfully combining and improving upon existing sketching approaches with proven convergence properties.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized framework for the estimation problem of
large-scale linear statistical models, namely Sequential Least-Squares
Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching (SLSE-FRS), which integrates
Sketch-and-Solve and Iterative-Sketching methods for the first time. By
iteratively constructing and solving sketched least-squares (LS) subproblems
with increasing sketch sizes to achieve better precisions, SLSE-FRS gradually
refines the estimators of the true parameter vector, ultimately producing
high-precision estimators. We analyze the convergence properties of SLSE-FRS,
and provide its efficient implementation. Numerical experiments show that
SLSE-FRS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely the Preconditioned
Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, and the Iterative Double Sketching (IDS)
method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops statistical foundations for transductive node classification using graph convolutional networks, establishing concentration-of-measure tools that leverage geometric regularities of large graphs through low-dimensional metric embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use of graph convolutional networks for transductive node classification, statistical foundations remain limited as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph.

Method: Develops new concentration-of-measure tools using low-dimensional metric embeddings to capture geometric regularities of large graphs, with analysis covering both arbitrary deterministic graphs and random graphs sharing properties with Erdős-Rényi graphs.

Result: Establishes learning guarantees that remain informative even with few labeled nodes and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate O(N^{-1/2}) as the number of labeled nodes grows.

Conclusion: The work provides rigorous statistical foundations for transductive learning on graphs, addressing gaps in existing frameworks and demonstrating optimal learning rates for graph convolutional networks in node classification tasks.

Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of
graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing
labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix.
Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of
transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks
typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In
this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure
tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via
low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using
a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic
graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first
concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses
random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log
(k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the
second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network
setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees
remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal
nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.

*Ziran Wang,Jie An,Naijun Zhan,Miaomiao Zhang,Zhenya Zhang*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: Synthesis of timed regular expressions from positive and negative examples for Cyber-Physical Systems, with a two-step method involving candidate enumeration and SMT solving for minimal length expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timed regular expressions are needed to specify real-time behaviors of Cyber-Physical Systems, and there's a need to automatically generate expressions that correctly classify given positive and negative behavioral examples.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) enumerate and prune candidate parametric timed regular expressions, 2) encode consistency requirements into SMT formulas to solve parametric time constraints and find minimal length expressions.

Result: The approach successfully generates consistent timed regular expressions with minimal length, evaluated on benchmarks including randomly generated behaviors and a case study.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for synthesizing timed regular expressions from examples, with proven decidability and practical applicability to Cyber-Physical Systems.

Abstract: Timed regular expressions serve as a formalism for specifying real-time
behaviors of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we consider the synthesis
of timed regular expressions, focusing on generating a timed regular expression
consistent with a given set of system behaviors including positive and negative
examples, i.e., accepting all positive examples and rejecting all negative
examples. We first prove the decidability of the synthesis problem through an
exploration of simple timed regular expressions. Subsequently, we propose our
method of generating a consistent timed regular expression with minimal length,
which unfolds in two steps. The first step is to enumerate and prune candidate
parametric timed regular expressions. In the second step, we encode the
requirement that a candidate generated by the first step is consistent with the
given set into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula, which is
consequently solved to determine a solution to parametric time constraints.
Finally, we evaluate our approach on benchmarks, including randomly generated
behaviors from target timed models and a case study.

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits using quantum walks and amplitude amplification


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend quantum reinforcement learning to graph-constrained multi-armed bandit problems where quantum approaches are currently limited

Method: Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI) using quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions and applying amplitude amplification via Szegedy's walk framework

Result: Analyzed complete and bipartite graphs, derived maximal success probability of identifying best arm and optimal time step for achievement

Conclusion: Quantum walks can accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend quantum algorithms for decision-making tasks with structural restrictions

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum
computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem
extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum
approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm
identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification
(QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over
graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing
the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link
between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural
restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal
success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it
is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate
exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum
algorithms for decision-making.

### [496] [The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06218)
*Shuowei Ma,Junyu Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Classical shadows vs quantum footage: Classical shadows are better for many observables with small Pauli weight, while quantum footage excels for few highly non-local observables or limited classical processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when classical shadow method is more efficient than direct quantum measurement (quantum footage) for extracting classical information from quantum states, addressing limitations in current methods.

Method: Performed full-stack resource analysis comparing classical shadows with quantum footage, considering parameters like number of qubits, observables, sparsity, Pauli weight, accuracy requirements, and failure tolerance.

Result: Classical shadows outperform direct measurement for many observables with small Pauli weight. For sparse Hermitian matrices, classical shadows show advantage within specific parameter ranges. Break-even points vary by hardware type.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative boundaries for choosing between classical shadows and quantum footage, offering practical guidance for optimal hybrid quantum-classical tomography strategies in real applications.

Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in
full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method
efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states,
enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few
measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or
when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is
not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue
quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares
classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum
measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of
download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For
observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical
shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is
large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large
Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when
the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits
fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior
include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight
$w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also
compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of
quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow
method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper
opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid
quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the
most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Neural architecture for simulating open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control, achieving 1000x speedup over traditional solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical numerical solvers for open quantum systems with spatial structure are computationally demanding and preclude real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control.

Method: Regional attention-based neural architecture that incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as inductive bias and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters.

Result: Achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, with acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers.

Conclusion: Provides a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, relevant to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater design, real-time optimization, and scalable device modeling.

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and
external control is an important challenge in quantum information science.
Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master
and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and
optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale
simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural
architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum
systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an
inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on
time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two
representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model
achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up
to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate
that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for
spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to
large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design,
real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across
diverse light-matter platforms.

TL;DR: Hybrid model combining FNO-based EM solver with plasma fluid solver achieves 60X acceleration for HPM breakdown simulations while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High Power Microwave breakdown simulation is computationally expensive due to multiscale nature requiring coupled Maxwell's equations and plasma continuity equations.

Method: Hybrid approach using Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for EM field updates trained on FDTD data, coupled with differential equation-based plasma fluid solver.

Result: 60X acceleration compared to traditional simulations with excellent agreement in streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution for unseen incident fields.

Conclusion: Hybrid FNO strategy provides efficient alternative for multiscale HPM simulations and demonstrates integration of C-based codes with Python ML frameworks.

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale
phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's
equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma
solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the
accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the
computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver.
Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO
replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver
governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave
streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for
unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer
simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with
FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal
evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of
the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem
size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding
multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work
also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to
integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning
frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reliable magnetic ground state identification in high-throughput materials databases where DFT workflows often converge to incorrect ferromagnetic solutions.

Method: Developed machine learning classifiers (LightGBM and XGBoost) trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA using compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors from Materials Project database.

Result: Propagation vector classifiers achieved >92% accuracy, exposed systematic ferromagnetic bias in 7,843+ Materials Project materials, and models trained on Materials Project labels achieved 84-86% accuracy.

Conclusion: Machine learning serves as corrective and exploratory tool for more trustworthy databases, accelerating identification of materials with various magnetic properties.

Abstract: The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major
challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional
theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we
partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers
trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a
limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors
sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers
achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably
distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a
systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for
more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained
directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with
macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale
screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers.
These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective
and exploratory tools, enabling more trustworthy databases and accelerating
progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.

TL;DR: LLM use under specific conditions can be considered analogous to senior authorship, making AI-assisted writing legitimate according to current authorship criteria in many fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversy around LLM use in academic writing and provide a framework for understanding how humans using LLMs can legitimately count as authors, similar to senior researchers who guide projects but don't write content.

Method: The authors present an argument by analogy, comparing LLM use to senior authorship where researchers guide projects, determine scope, and vouch for integrity without necessarily writing content themselves.

Result: The paper establishes that LLM-assisted writing can be considered legitimate authorship under current criteria used in many academic fields for distributed research teams.

Conclusion: Either LLM use should be recognized as legitimate authorship, or current authorship criteria require fundamental revision to maintain consistency in how we attribute academic contributions.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI advances, governing its development becomes crucial for public safety, but regulatory actions may face legal challenges that could invalidate them, requiring proactive consideration of litigation risks.

Method: Investigates three classes of potential litigation risk for AI regulation: First Amendment (free speech concerns), administrative law (procedural requirements), and Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection issues), analyzing existing precedent applicable to AI.

Result: Identifies specific legal challenges likely to arise from AI regulation and provides guidance on how lawmakers can preemptively address these constitutional and administrative law concerns.

Conclusion: Effective AI regulation is possible but requires careful implementation to avoid legal challenges; lawmakers must consider constitutional and administrative law constraints when designing AI governance frameworks.

Abstract: As AI advances, governing its development may become paramount to public
safety. Lawmakers may seek to restrict the development and release of AI models
or of AI research itself. These governance actions could trigger legal
challenges that invalidate the actions, so lawmakers should consider these
challenges ahead of time. We investigate three classes of potential litigation
risk for AI regulation in the U.S.: the First Amendment, administrative law,
and the Fourteenth Amendment. We discuss existing precedent that is likely to
apply to AI, which legal challenges are likely to arise, and how lawmakers
might preemptively address them. Effective AI regulation is possible, but it
requires careful implementation to avoid these legal challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: New Zealand's housing quality has historically been poor with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating, leading to energy hardship. Recent policy reforms have improved conditions but challenges persist with partial retrofits, limited performance data, and fragmented decision-making support.

Method: Developed a prototype using Python and Streamlit with modular dashboard features including data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades). Evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 15 domain experts including building scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners.

Result: Strong usability (M = 4.3), high value of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive expert perceptions of the tool's potential to complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool effectively bridges the gap between national policies and practical household-level decision-making.

Conclusion: The AI-powered tool demonstrates how technology can translate national energy policies into personalized guidance, offering a replicable framework for reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling, national dataset integration, and longitudinal adoption trials.

Abstract: Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health
outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has
historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating
contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the
Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code
upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges
persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are
limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study
presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for
residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using
Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline
modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades)
into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building
scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through
semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value
of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to
complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates
how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level
guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical
decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for
reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate
goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling,
integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess
real-world adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how frontier AI developers use user chat data for model training and identify privacy concerns in the rapidly growing chatbot market.

Method: Developed a novel qualitative coding schema based on California Consumer Privacy Act to analyze privacy policies of six U.S. AI developers, comparing their data collection and usage practices.

Result: All six developers use user chat data for model training by default; some retain data indefinitely; collect sensitive personal information including biometric and health data; four include children's chat data; policies lack essential transparency.

Conclusion: Urgent need for greater transparency, accountability, and policy interventions to address privacy risks from default data collection, indefinite retention, and use of sensitive/children's data in LLM training.

Abstract: Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language
models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of
high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win
market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI
developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models.
Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel
qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy
policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies.
We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to
train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data
indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information
disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and
health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we
examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as
customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies
often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need
for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of
users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data
security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on
children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers
and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered
chatbots.

Motivation: Automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs is essential for domain knowledge modeling but lacks scalable and reliable approaches. There's a need for a unified and robust pipeline for automatic EduKG generation from learning materials.

Method: Proposes a pipeline that generates slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, then merges them into a comprehensive EduKG. Evaluated on MOOC platform CourseMapper, then introduced targeted optimizations across multiple pipeline components to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Initial accuracy was relatively low for educational context. After optimization, achieved 17.5% improvement in accuracy and tenfold increase in processing efficiency. The optimized pipeline offers holistic, scalable end-to-end EduKG construction.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and adaptable pipeline for automatic EduKG construction that supports improved semantic representation of learning content across diverse educational contexts.

Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
essential for domain knowledge modeling by extracting meaningful
representations from learning materials. Despite growing interest, identifying
a scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a
challenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic
EduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG
construction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating
slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form
a comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate
the accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC
platform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial
success, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the
reliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful
learning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple
pipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in
accuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a
holistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction,
adaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic
representation of learning content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EduKG in CourseMapper lacks explicit prerequisite relationship links, and manual annotation is time-consuming and inconsistent, requiring automated solution.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show higher precision than existing methods while maintaining scalability and adaptability.

Conclusion: Provides reliable support for sequence-aware learning in CourseMapper through automated prerequisite relationship inference.

Abstract: Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) organize various learning entities and
their relationships to support structured and adaptive learning. Prerequisite
relationships (PRs) are critical in EduKGs for defining the logical order in
which concepts should be learned. However, the current EduKG in the MOOC
platform CourseMapper lacks explicit PR links, and manually annotating them is
time-consuming and inconsistent. To address this, we propose an unsupervised
method for automatically inferring concept PRs without relying on labeled data.
We define ten criteria based on document-based, Wikipedia hyperlink-based,
graph-based, and text-based features, and combine them using a voting algorithm
to robustly capture PRs in educational content. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that our approach achieves higher precision than existing methods
while maintaining scalability and adaptability, thus providing reliable support

### [507] [From Vision to Validation: A Theory- and Data-Driven Construction of a GCC-Specific AI Adoption Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05474)
*Mohammad Rashed Albous,Anwaar AlKandari,Abdel Latef Anouze*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study develops a novel AI Adoption Index specifically for GCC public sectors, combining policy analysis with empirical data to identify infrastructure and policy mandates as key drivers of successful AI implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized AI measures don't account for the unique drivers, governance models, and cultural nuances of GCC countries, creating a gap in understanding AI adoption in this specific regional context.

Method: Combined theory-driven approach (literature review + analysis of 6 National AI Strategies) with data-driven approach (survey of 203 government employees) using advanced statistical techniques including K-Means clustering, PCA, and PLS-SEM.

Result: Infrastructure and policy mandates have strongest influence on AI success, overshadowing organizational readiness in early stages. The model explains 70% of variance in AI outcomes, showing resource-rich environments and top-down policies drive rapid but uneven adoption.

Conclusion: The developed AI Adoption Index provides a holistic, context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity in GCC public sectors, offering actionable guidance for policymakers to harmonize deployments with ethical standards and support sustained transformation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes
worldwide, yet standardized measures rarely address the unique drivers,
governance models, and cultural nuances of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries. This study employs a theory-driven foundation derived from an
in-depth analysis of literature review and six National AI Strategies (NASs),
coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and
senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means
clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the
research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored
to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust infrastructure and
clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI
implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption
stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes,
suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can
drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions
(Infrastructure & Resources, Organizational Readiness, and Policy & Regulatory
Environment) into a single composite index, this study provides a holistic yet
context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity. The index offers
actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale
deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic
discourse, these insights inform more strategic allocation of resources,
cross-country cooperation, and capacity-building initiatives, thereby
supporting sustained AI-driven transformation in the GCC region and beyond.

*Sheila Wafula,Blessed Madukoma*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Study develops a composite risk score to assess COVID-19 vulnerability across Nigerian states, identifying high-density urban areas like Lagos as highest risk hotspots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify factors contributing to COVID-19 vulnerability in Nigeria's public health system to inform targeted resource allocation.

Method: Composite risk score integrating population density (0.2), poverty (0.4), healthcare access (0.3), and age risk (0.1), adjusted by case rates. Used GIS mapping and state categorization by density, supplemented with Google Trends data.

Result: Lagos had highest risk score (673.47 vs national average 28.16) and accounted for 35.4% of national cases. High-density urban areas identified as primary hotspots.

Conclusion: Risk score provides prioritization tool for policymakers, though data gaps and rural underreporting require further research. Framework applicable to other infectious diseases in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges in Nigeria's
public health systems since the first case reported on February 27, 2020. This
study investigates key factors that contribute to state vulnerability,
quantifying them through a composite risk score integrating population density
(weight 0.2), poverty (0.4), access to healthcare (0.3), and age risk (0.1),
adjusted by normalized case rates per 100,000. States were categorized into
low-, medium-, and high-density areas to analyze trends and identify hotspots
using geographic information system (GIS) mapping. The findings reveal that
high-density urban areas, such as Lagos, accounting for 35.4% of national
cases, had the highest risk scores (Lagos: 673.47 vs. national average: 28.16).
These results align with global and local studies on the spatial variability of
COVID-19 in Nigeria, including international frameworks such as the CDC Social
Vulnerability Index. Google Trends data highlight variations in public health
awareness, serving as a supplementary analysis to contextualize vulnerability.
The risk score provides a prioritization tool for policymakers to allocate
testing, vaccines, and healthcare resources to high-risk areas, though data
gaps and rural underreporting call for further research. This framework can
extend to other infectious diseases, offering lessons for future pandemics in
resource-limited settings.

### [509] [Audits Under Resource, Data, and Access Constraints: Scaling Laws For Less Discriminatory Alternatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05627)
*Sarah H. Cen,Salil Goyal,Zaynah Javed,Ananya Karthik,Percy Liang,Daniel E. Ho*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Proposes a method to help claimants prove the existence of less discriminatory alternatives in AI discrimination cases without needing extensive resources or model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anti-discrimination law places burden on claimants to prove less discriminatory alternatives exist, but this is difficult due to limited resources, compute, data access, and trade secret protections around AI models.

Method: Develops a closed-form upper bound for loss-fairness Pareto frontier that allows extrapolation from small models to large ones. Claimants only need a small data subsample and can train as few as 7 small models to fit the frontier.

Result: The scaling law holds even when theoretical conditions aren't perfectly met, enabling claimants to determine if less discriminatory alternatives exist without training large models.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution to overcome resource barriers in AI discrimination cases by enabling efficient assessment of less discriminatory alternatives through scaling laws and Pareto frontier analysis.

Abstract: AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of
the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination
law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the "less
discriminatory alternative" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,
model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves
comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.
Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant
(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI
cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet
high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most
litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to
their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to
reproduce a similar model from scratch.
  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an
LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model
access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic
parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we
provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier
(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the "low-resource
regime," then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being
contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus
serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the
claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the
claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)
models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling
law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.

### [510] [Operationalising AI Regulatory Sandboxes under the EU AI Act: The Triple Challenge of Capacity, Coordination and Attractiveness to Providers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05985)
*Deirdre Ahern*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The EU AI Act requires national regulatory sandboxes for AI testing, but faces challenges in implementation consistency and attractiveness to innovators due to confidentiality concerns and lack of legal flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implementation challenges of AI regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act, particularly focusing on how they can both foster innovation and ensure compliance while maintaining uniform interpretation across Member States.

Method: Analysis of the EU AI Act provisions regarding regulatory sandboxes, examination of potential implementation challenges for Member States, and assessment of attractiveness factors for innovators considering sandbox participation.

Result: Identified significant challenges including capacity-building difficulties for Member States, risk of inconsistent interpretation across national sandboxes leading to regulatory arbitrage, and concerns that sandboxes may be unattractive to innovators due to confidentiality issues, inability to relax legal rules, and lack of presumption of conformity.

Conclusion: The European Commission and AI Board need to develop cohesive rules and guidance to ensure coordinated national approaches, as voluntary sandbox participation may otherwise fail to attract innovators who have alternative compliance routes through harmonized standards and conformity assessment procedures.

Abstract: The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market
or into service in the European Union. This article investigates the
requirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI
regulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under
regulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with
regulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI
regulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,
considerable challenges are identified for Member States around
capacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are
early movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the
article contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by
individual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the
AI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play
sandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission
and the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to
ensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.
With sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory
sandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is
also explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules
during the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of
conformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators
contemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct
compliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards
and conformity assessment procedures.

Motivation: Address the urgent need for professionals who can handle ethical, legal and governance challenges in AI systems, as current education remains fragmented and disconnected from practice.

Method: Synthesizes literature and regulatory developments to create a modular curriculum, drawing on perspectives from EU, China and international frameworks. Emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning.

Result: Develops a semester plan that prepares students to diagnose AI risks, navigate regulations, and engage diverse stakeholders effectively.

Conclusion: The curriculum aims to foster adaptive, ethically grounded professionals capable of responsible AI governance through interdisciplinary education that bridges theory and practice.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems permeate critical sectors, the need
for professionals who can address ethical, legal and governance challenges has
become urgent. Current AI ethics education remains fragmented, often siloed by
discipline and disconnected from practice. This paper synthesizes literature
and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum
that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight
recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives,
generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to
pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance. Drawing on perspectives from
the EU, China and international frameworks, we outline a semester plan that
emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning.
The curriculum aims to prepare students to diagnose risks, navigate regulation
and engage diverse stakeholders, fostering adaptive and ethically grounded
professionals for responsible AI governance.

### [512] [Repeating vs. Non-Repeating FRBs: A Deep Learning Approach To Morphological Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06208)
*Bikash Kharel,Emmanuel Fonseca,Charanjot Brar,Afrokk Khan,Lluis Mas-Ribas,Swarali Shivraj Patil,Paul Scholz,Seth Robert Siegel,David C. Stenning*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using transfer learning with pretrained ConvNext to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) into repeaters vs non-repeaters based on morphological features in dynamic spectra, achieving high classification performance with reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for classifying FRBs into repeater and non-repeater categories based on their morphological characteristics in dynamic spectra, leveraging deep learning to handle complex patterns that may not be easily discernible by traditional methods.

Method: Used transfer learning with pretrained ConvNext architecture, treating dedispersed dynamic spectra as images. Fine-tuned the model on FRB spectrograms from CHIME/FRB Catalog 2, using mathematical model representation for interpretation.

Result: Achieved high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power compared to training from scratch. Results show morphological differences between repeating and non-repeating FRBs persist in Catalog 2 data.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned deep learning model can effectively predict FRB morphology types and may become increasingly valuable as larger datasets become available, providing insights into the classification of fast radio bursts.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs)
based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from
CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained
ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability.
ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as
images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and
non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and
relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used
mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the
deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB
spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while
substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to
training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases
without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that
the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events
persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences
for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for
inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles
that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly
significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near
future.

*Yingjie Zhao,Yicheng Song,Fan Xu,Zhiping Xu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Physics-transfer learning framework uses mechanics from simple geometries to analyze complex brain morphology, overcoming data scarcity with digital modeling library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain morphology's fractal features and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative medical analysis, requiring new approaches to understand developmental processes and diseases.

Method: Developed physics-transfer learning framework that embeds nonlinear elasticity physics from simple geometries into neural networks, combined with digital library of continuum mechanics modeling for brain growth and disease prediction.

Result: Framework demonstrates remarkable performance in feature characterization and morphogenesis prediction, revealing localized deformation dominates over background geometry, and provides reduced-dimensional evolutionary representations.

Conclusion: Validated through medical images and expertise, this approach enables digital-twin technology for comprehending brain morphological complexity and provides essential physics understanding of cerebral cortex folding.

Abstract: Brain morphology is shaped by genetic and mechanical factors and is linked to
biological development and diseases. Its fractal-like features, regional
anisotropy, and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative insights in
medical inspections. Recognizing that the underlying elastic instability and
bifurcation share the same physics as simple geometries such as spheres and
ellipses, we developed a physics-transfer learning framework to address the
geometrical complexity. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we
constructed a digital library of high-fidelity continuum mechanics modeling
that both describes and predicts the developmental processes of brain growth
and disease. The physics of nonlinear elasticity from simple geometries is
embedded into a neural network and applied to brain models. This
physics-transfer approach demonstrates remarkable performance in feature
characterization and morphogenesis prediction, highlighting the pivotal role of
localized deformation in dominating over the background geometry. The
data-driven framework also provides a library of reduced-dimensional
evolutionary representations that capture the essential physics of the highly
folded cerebral cortex. Validation through medical images and domain expertise
underscores the deployment of digital-twin technology in comprehending the
morphological complexity of the brain.

TL;DR: First 3D data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs with Hill-type muscle representation, enabling muscle-actuated behavioral replay and imitation learning in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between motor neuron activity and joint movements in Drosophila by creating anatomically and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles, despite available complete reconstructions of the nervous system and anatomy.

Method: Developed 3D musculoskeletal model using high-resolution X-ray scans from fixed specimens, implemented in OpenSim and MuJoCo. Created pipeline for muscle model construction and parameter optimization. Combined with 3D pose estimation data for behavioral replay and used imitation learning policies.

Result: Successfully achieved muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim, predicted coordinated muscle synergies across walking and grooming behaviors, and found that damping and stiffness facilitate learning in imitation learning policies.

Conclusion: The model enables investigation of motor control in Drosophila and provides insights into how biomechanics contribute to complex limb movements. It can also be used to control artificial agents for naturalistic locomotion in simulations.

Abstract: Computational models are critical to advance our understanding of how neural,
biomechanical, and physical systems interact to orchestrate animal behaviors.
Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila
melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically
and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These
models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint
movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model
of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation
environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on
high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a
pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and
for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine
our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving
flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of
muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict
coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by
training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different
passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness
facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor
control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into
how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover,
our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate
naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.

*Gaia Molinaro,Anne G. E. Collins*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Human goal-dependent learning initially relies on working memory but becomes more efficient through compression of reward functions into long-term memory, freeing cognitive resources for better learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans can flexibly assign value to abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner while managing cognitive costs, and to explore the cognitive mechanisms that make this learning efficient.

Method: Conducted six experiments testing learning performance under varying goal space sizes and structures, used computational modeling, and measured reward processing speed correlations with learning performance.

Result: Learning is impaired by larger goal spaces but improves when goal space structure allows compression. Faster reward processing correlates with better learning, supporting automatic goal valuation freeing cognitive resources.

Conclusion: Efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into stable reward functions, providing insights into cognitive mechanisms of human motivation and potential applications for improving goal achievement techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely
assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However,
this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here,
we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a
capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners
create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal)
which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon
receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting
learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent
with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically
impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space
structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to
correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal
valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We
leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work
suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex
goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive
mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the
neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral
techniques that support people in achieving their goals.

TL;DR: Semi-Global Matching with superpixel refinement improves Mars rover terrain mapping by reducing block artifacts and recovering details in low-texture areas, outperforming traditional block-matching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stereo matching methods for Mars exploration struggle with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns due to limited context understanding, requiring more robust terrain modeling for safe rover navigation.

Method: Uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to balance efficiency and accuracy, adding context-aware segmentation for more coherent depth inference in terrain modeling.

Result: Evaluation on three datasets shows improved structural consistency in sloped/occluded regions, reduced gaps behind rocks, better capture of surface details, and more precise disparity maps suitable for autonomous navigation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a complete terrain modeling pipeline that offers competitive accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar energy adoption is critical for net-zero emissions, but industrial/commercial actors struggle with adoption decisions due to lack of fast, low-cost, high-resolution irradiance forecasts.

Method: SunCastNet - a lightweight data-driven forecasting system providing 0.05°, 10-minute resolution SSRD predictions up to 7 days ahead, coupled with reinforcement learning for battery scheduling.

Result: Reduces operational regret by 76-93% compared to robust decision making. Enables 5 of 10 high-emitting industrial sectors per region to achieve commercial viability (12% IRR) in 25-year investment backtests.

Conclusion: High-resolution, long-horizon solar forecasts translate directly into measurable economic gains, supporting near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.

Abstract: Solar energy adoption is critical to achieving net-zero emissions. However,
it remains difficult for many industrial and commercial actors to decide on
whether they should adopt distributed solar-battery systems, which is largely
due to the unavailability of fast, low-cost, and high-resolution irradiance
forecasts. Here, we present SunCastNet, a lightweight data-driven forecasting
system that provides 0.05$^\circ$, 10-minute resolution predictions of surface
solar radiation downwards (SSRD) up to 7 days ahead. SunCastNet, coupled with
reinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret
by 76--93\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment
backtests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per
region to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\% Internal Rate of
Return (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar
forecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting
near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.

TL;DR: RestTSLLM uses LLMs with Test Specification Language to automate REST API test generation from OpenAPI specs, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet performing best across all metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API testing is challenging due to distributed system complexity, numerous scenarios, and time constraints, leading to undetected failures and limited test coverage.

Method: Combines Test Specification Language with LLMs using prompt engineering and automated pipeline to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications, evaluating models on success rate, coverage, and mutation score.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models (Deepseek R1, Qwen 2.5 32b, Sabia 3) across every metric, consistently producing robust and coherent REST API tests.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for automating REST API test generation based on specifications, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet emerging as the most suitable model for this task.

Abstract: The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

Motivation: Textual similarity alone is insufficient for NL-PL traceability due to semantic gaps between natural language and programming language artifacts, requiring more sophisticated approaches.

Method: Proposed multi-strategy approach incorporating domain-specific auxiliary strategies into Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (via edge types) and prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro (via additional input information).

Result: Both enhanced models outperformed original versions and state-of-art HGNNLink, with average F1-score improvements of 3.68% (HGT) and 8.84% (Gemini) across 12 open-source projects.

Conclusion: Multi-strategy integration effectively enhances model performance for requirements-to-code traceability link recovery tasks, demonstrating the value of domain-specific strategies beyond textual similarity.

Abstract: In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and
Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy
integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method
HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average
F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve
open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy
integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code
TLR task.

*Qianheng Zhang,Song Gao,Chen Wei,Yibo Zhao,Ying Nie,Ziru Chen,Shijie Chen,Yu Su,Huan Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GeoAnalystBench benchmark reveals significant performance gap between proprietary and open-source LLMs on geospatial tasks, with proprietary models achieving 95% validity vs 48.5% for open-source models, highlighting both promise and limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in geospatial analysis before making claims about full GIS automation, addressing the uncertainty around their actual performance on geoprocessing tasks.

Method: Created GeoAnalystBench with 50 Python-based tasks from real-world geospatial problems, validated by GIS experts. Each task has minimum deliverable product, evaluated on workflow validity, structural alignment, semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Tested both proprietary and open source models.

Result: Proprietary models (ChatGPT-4o-mini) achieved 95% validity and CodeBLEU 0.39, while smaller open source models (DeepSeek-R1-7B) showed 48.5% validity and CodeBLEU 0.272. Tasks requiring spatial reasoning (relationship detection, site selection) were most challenging across all models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promise and limitations in GIS automation. The benchmark provides a reproducible framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support, demonstrating clear performance gaps between model types.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code2MCP is an automated framework that converts GitHub repositories into MCP-compliant services to solve the N×M integration problem in AI agent ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmentation and development overhead in LLM tool integration (N×M problem) by automating the conversion of existing GitHub repositories into MCP services, overcoming manual adoption barriers.

Method: Multi-stage workflow with LLM-driven closed-loop "Run-Review-Fix" cycle that autonomously analyzes code, configures environments, generates services, debugs, and repairs generated code.

Result: Produces deployable MCP services with comprehensive technical documentation, systematically unlocking GitHub's open-source repositories for automated tool integration.

Conclusion: Code2MCP accelerates MCP ecosystem growth by automating the critical last mile of tool integration and making the world's largest code repository accessible to AI agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at

### [524] [Empirical Study of Code Large Language Models for Binary Security Patch Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06052)
*Qingyuan Li,Binchang Li,Cuiyun Gao,Shuzheng Gao,Zongjie Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in security patch detection for binary files by creating a large dataset and evaluating 19 code LLMs, finding that fine-tuned models perform best on pseudo-code representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based security patch detection approaches work well on source code but cannot handle closed-source applications that only release binary patches, creating a critical security gap.

Method: Constructed a large-scale binary patch dataset with 19,448 samples in assembly and pseudo-code representations, then systematically evaluated 19 code LLMs of varying scales, followed by fine-tuning strategies to inject binary SPD domain knowledge.

Result: Vanilla code LLMs struggle with binary security patch detection even with advanced prompting techniques. Fine-tuned LLMs achieved outstanding performance, with best results on pseudo-code representation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning code LLMs with binary security patch detection domain knowledge significantly improves performance, making them effective for detecting security patches in binary files where source code is unavailable.

Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Study examines how open-source projects manage pre-trained models (PTMs) as Software Dependencies 2.0, analyzing integration patterns and maintenance practices in 401 GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTMs represent a new class of software dependency (Software Dependencies 2.0) that extends beyond conventional libraries, but their integration in real projects remains unclear, potentially threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems.

Method: Mixed-methods analysis of 401 GitHub repositories from PeaTMOSS dataset, quantitatively examining PTM reuse patterns and qualitatively investigating how developers integrate and manage these models in practice.

Result: The study identifies how OSS projects structure/document PTM dependencies, reveals stages and organizational patterns in PTM reuse pipelines, and examines interactions among PTMs and other learned components.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the emerging practices of managing PTMs as software dependencies, addressing maintainability and reliability concerns in systems increasingly reliant on pre-trained models.

Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) introduces a dual modality approach with SE for Humans and SE for Agents, requiring reimagined SE pillars and proposing two specialized workbenches (ACE and AEE) for structured human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness the capabilities of intelligent agents for complex software engineering objectives while ensuring trustworthiness, moving beyond simple code generation to true agentic software engineering.

Method: Proposes a dual modality framework with two purpose-built workbenches: Agent Command Environment (ACE) for human orchestration and mentoring, and Agent Execution Environment (AEE) for agent task performance with human callback capabilities.

Result: Introduces Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision with redefined foundational pillars (actors, processes, tools, artifacts) and creates new structured engineering activities for human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Provides a conceptual framework and research roadmap to catalyze community dialogue, pushing SE beyond human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future, with implications for SE education.

Abstract: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HyGLAD is an interpretable pattern-based algorithm for event anomaly detection that outperforms deep learning methods while being more efficient and providing transparent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect event-based anomalies in stationary systems where deviations from normal behavior indicate malicious activity, with a focus on interpretability rather than black-box deep learning approaches.

Method: Infers equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior from events and builds regular expressions that capture entity values, creating directly interpretable patterns for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five real-world datasets, with 1.2x precision improvement and 1.3x recall improvement compared to second-best baseline, while being an order of magnitude more efficient (single CPU vs GPU).

Conclusion: HyGLAD provides superior performance and efficiency over deep learning methods while offering the crucial advantage of interpretable patterns and anomalies, making it suitable for real-world security applications.

Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of
interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used
to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation
from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers
equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,
and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.
As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly
interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate
HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five
datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average
HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of
magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).
Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best
baseline.

TL;DR: Analysis shows decentralized online optimization algorithms have overly conservative performance guarantees, some don't benefit from communications initially, and step-size tuning can improve worst-case performance by up to 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide more accurate worst-case performance analysis of decentralized online optimization algorithms and identify opportunities for improvement, as existing guarantees are overly conservative and may lead to poor algorithm selection.

Method: Using the Performance Estimation Problem approach to automatically compute exact worst-case performance of optimization algorithms, analyzing step-sizes and inter-agent communications.

Result: Found that current performance guarantees are very conservative (sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude), some algorithms don't benefit from communications initially, and step-size tuning can improve worst-case performance regret by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Classical decentralized optimization methods can be significantly improved through proper step-size tuning, and performance guarantees need to be more accurately characterized to avoid misguided algorithm choices.

Abstract: We analyze Decentralized Online Optimization algorithms using the Performance
Estimation Problem approach which allows, to automatically compute exact
worst-case performance of optimization algorithms. Our analysis shows that
several available performance guarantees are very conservative, sometimes by
multiple orders of magnitude, and can lead to misguided choices of algorithm.
Moreover, at least in terms of worst-case performance, some algorithms appear
not to benefit from inter-agent communications for a significant period of
time. We show how to improve classical methods by tuning their step-sizes, and
find that we can save up to 20% on their actual worst-case performance regret.

Abstract: To overcome the inherent inefficiencies of traditional trial-and-error
materials discovery, the scientific community is increasingly developing
autonomous laboratories that integrate data-driven decision-making into
closed-loop experimental workflows. In this work, we realize this concept for
thermoresponsive polymers by developing a low-cost, "frugal twin" platform for
the optimization of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Our system integrates robotic
fluid-handling, on-line sensors, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that navigates
the multi-component salt solution spaces to achieve user-specified LCST
targets. The platform demonstrates convergence to target properties within a
minimal number of experiments. It strategically explores the parameter space,
learns from informative "off-target" results, and self-corrects to achieve the
final targets. By providing an accessible and adaptable blueprint, this work
lowers the barrier to entry for autonomous experimentation and accelerates the
design and discovery of functional polymers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of coupling fine-scale hydrodynamics with large-scale collective effects in active particle systems that both deform and are deformed by surrounding fluids.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) High-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots as input, 2) E(2)-equivariant graph neural network for pairwise interaction forces respecting symmetries, 3) Physics-informed neural network with Fourier features and topological regularization using persistent homology.

Result: Developed a holistic, data-driven framework that captures both physical underpinnings and emerging multi-scale structures typical for active matter systems.

Conclusion: The integrated multi-scale learning approach successfully bridges fine-scale hydrodynamics with collective behavior in active particle systems through a combination of specialized neural network components with physical constraints.

Abstract: Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents
that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable
problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale
collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the
three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use
high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle
stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step
takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict
pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural
network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed
neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with
a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is
additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent
homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In
concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network
prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging
multi-scale structure typical for active matter.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Dato is a Python-embedded programming model for dataflow accelerators that makes data communication and sharding first-class constructs, enabling high performance while reducing development overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning workloads exceed memory system capabilities, with kernels stalling on data movement. Existing programming models either require low-level development overhead or abstract away communication details, limiting optimization potential.

Method: Dato uses a task-based programming model where developers write programs as graphs of tasks connected via explicit stream types with sharded inputs specified using layout types. Tasks are virtually mapped to the accelerator fabric, then compiled to physical mappings respecting hardware constraints.

Result: Dato achieves up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM on AMD Ryzen AI NPU, delivers 2.81x speedup on attention kernels vs commercial frameworks, and reaches 98% of theoretical peak performance on FPGA systolic arrays.

Conclusion: Dato successfully bridges the gap between low-level control and high-level abstraction, enabling efficient dataflow programming while significantly reducing development burden and achieving near-peak hardware performance.

Abstract: Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond
what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data
movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators
incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations,
existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively.
Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant
development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away
communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to
reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded,
task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data
communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write
programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded
inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually
onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a
physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on
both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves
high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized
code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and
delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art
commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in
performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching presents challenges for ASR systems, especially for Vietnamese-English pairs due to distinct phonological features and sound recognition ambiguity. Existing methods fail to capture subtle phonological shifts in CS scenarios.

Method: Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC) using phoneme-centric approach with extended Vietnamese phoneme set as intermediate representation for mixed-lingual modeling.

Result: TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines including PhoWhisper-base, achieving significantly lower word error rate of 20.8% with reduced training resources.

Conclusion: The phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion, enhancing ASR performance in complex Vietnamese-English code-switching scenarios.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-audio models generate semantically aligned sound but lack precise control over fine-grained acoustic characteristics, making it challenging for users to generate specific desired audio content.

Method: A new framework that identifies auditory information from user-provided reference concepts, using few reference audio samples to generate new audio containing specific personalized events. Two types of datasets are developed for training and testing.

Result: DreamAudio generates audio highly consistent with customized audio features and well-aligned with text prompts, while maintaining comparable performance in general text-to-audio tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully addresses customized text-to-audio generation needs and provides a human-involved benchmark dataset for real-world CTTA cases.

Abstract: With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and
language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been
achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs,
existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound
and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics
of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may
find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we
present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA).
Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model
to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for
audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized
audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these
specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training
and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed
model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the
customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts.
Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio
tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from
real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.

TL;DR: MeanFlow-accelerated model enables one-step audio synthesis from silent videos, significantly improving inference speed while maintaining audio quality and synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between synthesis quality and inference efficiency in existing video-to-audio methods, particularly the slow inference speeds caused by iterative sampling processes in flow matching models.

Method: Introduces MeanFlow that characterizes flow fields using average velocity instead of instantaneous velocity, enabling one-step generation. Uses scalar rescaling mechanism to balance conditional and unconditional predictions when applying classifier-free guidance.

Result: Significantly accelerates multimodal video-to-audio synthesis while preserving audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Also performs well on text-to-audio synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: MeanFlow incorporation into networks improves inference speed without compromising perceptual quality on both video-to-audio and text-to-audio synthesis tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in synthesizing audios from silent videos is the inherent
trade-off between synthesis quality and inference efficiency in existing
methods. For instance, flow matching based models rely on modeling
instantaneous velocity, inherently require an iterative sampling process,
leading to slow inference speeds. To address this efficiency bottleneck, we
introduce a MeanFlow-accelerated model that characterizes flow fields using
average velocity, enabling one-step generation and thereby significantly
accelerating multimodal video-to-audio (VTA) synthesis while preserving audio
quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Furthermore, a
scalar rescaling mechanism is employed to balance conditional and unconditional
predictions when classifier-free guidance (CFG) is applied, effectively
mitigating CFG-induced distortions in one step generation. Since the audio
synthesis network is jointly trained with multimodal conditions, we further
evaluate it on text-to-audio (TTA) synthesis task. Experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating MeanFlow into the network significantly improves
inference speed without compromising perceptual quality on both VTA and TTA
synthesis tasks.

TL;DR: SKEL is a new parametric 3D human model that re-rigs SMPL with a biomechanically accurate skeleton, enabling more realistic human articulation and biomechanics applications from standard images/video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing body models like SMPL have simplified kinematic structures that don't correspond to true human skeletal anatomy, limiting their use in biomechanics. Current biomechanically accurate methods require complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization.

Method: Built a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. Learned a regressor from SMPL vertices to joint locations and bone rotations. Re-parameterized SMPL mesh with new kinematic parameters.

Result: SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, with bones fitting better inside the body surface. It enables upgrading existing datasets to include biomechanical parameters with fewer, more realistic degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: SKEL provides a tool for biomechanics in the wild and offers vision/graphics researchers a better constrained, more realistic human articulation model that maintains SMPL's animatability while improving biomechanical accuracy.

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

TL;DR: A novel view synthesis method that uses diffusion-generated synthetic data and token disentanglement in transformers to improve generalization and reduce artifacts, achieving state-of-the-art results with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based novel view synthesis models are limited by the diversity of available scene datasets, making real-world scenes out-of-distribution. Synthetic data from diffusion models offers scalability but introduces artifacts that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Propose a token disentanglement process within transformer architecture to enhance feature separation and enable more effective learning with synthetic data. Incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion models to improve generalization across unseen domains.

Result: Outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. Significantly reduces computational costs while improving reconstruction quality over standard transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of existing novel view synthesis approaches by combining synthetic data from diffusion models with architectural improvements in transformers, enabling better generalization to real-world scenes with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

TL;DR: Developed a causal dynamic multifidelity surrogate model for ICF capsule interface dynamics, enabling efficient inverse problem solving and radiation drive optimization using machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving high-dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems in inertial confinement fusion is extremely challenging, requiring new approaches to relate experimental observations to simulation parameters.

Method: Constructed a reduced-order surrogate mapping time-dependent radiation temperature drive to interface radius/velocity dynamics using ODE embedding, learned controller from multifidelity simulation data, and applied ML models for inverse optimization.

Result: Achieved excellent accuracy in surrogate interface modeling, successfully optimized radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics, and identified most informative sampling times.

Conclusion: Integration of operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias accelerates discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems like ICF.

Abstract: Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving
inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input
parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high dimensional
dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even
intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by
only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's
deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic,
multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation
temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The
surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed
by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and
high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group
structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface
model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to
solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce
observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further
characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics.
Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and
physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and
diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches for scientific discovery operate within fixed assumptions and lack the ability to discover new theoretical structures through systematic adaptation.

Method: A game design framework where scientific inquiry is recast as a rule-evolving system: agents operate in axiom-governed environments and modify rules to explain outlier observations.

Result: Preliminary experiments in logic-based games show agents can evolve axioms that solve previously unsolvable problems, demonstrating feasibility.

Conclusion: This framework provides a foundation for building ML systems capable of creative, interpretable, and theory-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: This position paper argues that machine learning for scientific discovery
should shift from inductive pattern recognition to axiom-based reasoning. We
propose a game design framework in which scientific inquiry is recast as a
rule-evolving system: agents operate within environments governed by axioms and
modify them to explain outlier observations. Unlike conventional ML approaches
that operate within fixed assumptions, our method enables the discovery of new
theoretical structures through systematic rule adaptation. We demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach through preliminary experiments in logic-based
games, showing that agents can evolve axioms that solve previously unsolvable
problems. This framework offers a foundation for building machine learning
systems capable of creative, interpretable, and theory-driven discovery.
